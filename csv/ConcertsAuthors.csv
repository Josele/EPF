0	06.05.2009, 16:20	5.0	['1', '1']	Perthia	"   Mod Insert:  Please  . Can't be bothered siphoning off all the higgedly piggedly gigs splattered around for different dates.   
Thanks for your understanding.   
Original Post follows:   
---   
(And you will know us by the) Trail of Dead  - Sunday May 10th at Mascotte.   
Greenday - November 8th Hallenstadion.
		 
			
			Well here goes....    
For chitter and chatter about gigs up and coming to run along side the wonderfully implemented calendar events and for the numpty simpletons like me who prefer the old fashioned way      
hopefully this will replace Jot's great 'Zurich Gig Guide' from the past - but will please all the unfortunate bumpkins that live outside the canton of Zurich    
			
			Why is it that some people have so much difficulty dealing with change?   
IMO This thread is pointless and selfish.
		 
			
			I was sure I was going to get groans for that and they will all be from people living in or around Zürich...   
When in real life a small group of people sharing the same interests (for example Zürich inhabitants, blondes, Audi TT owners, whatever...) joins up with a bigger group (for example Switzerland inhabitants, ladies who like to dye their hair, Audi owners...), you can then tell them a 1000 times that it doesn't make sense them staying together in their small group, that they should open up to the other people...If they don't want to change they won't.
		    well then go to this   instead? we cater for all    
			
			Primal Scream Xtra 16 th August.
		    Are you going Annie and Nicky? We may have to re-arrange my schedule a bit so we can go because they are good live.
		 
			
			We are Nigel, booked our tickets today.
		    Not sure yet - not listened to any of their recent stuff
		 
			
			The latest album is really good. Check out the website    
We now have tickets as well.       
I am also wondering about the Delilahs at Kaufleuten on 13th August.
		    Don't you think that there are Primal Scream fans living outside of Zurich?
		    Primal Scream are playing in Zurich therefore it is a 'Zurich Gig' - I created another thread to post gigs in Switzerland should anyone wish to....
		    Grrr.... 
Zurich is in Switzerland.
		    Why don't we have ""Yawn"" button as well as Thanks & Groan?
		 
			
			Well you all found this thread about Primal Scream playing in Zurich so whats the fuss.      PS I dont live in Zurich Kanton.      I found it because I actually live in Zurich and am registered to this thread.   
But why should a Primal Scream fan who does not live in Zurich have to wade through 10 pages of Zurich concerts to discover that his favourite band is going to play in Switzerland?   
If you want to keep this thread fair enough but please also add the events to the Concerts Calendar!
		    Who let you in? Anyways, this thread is far more pointless and selfish, it's only for Zurich Stadt       True but we should also have a ""This poster is being selfish"" button that would be worth 10 groans.
		    Why register to something that seems to cause you so much angst    
Anyone only using this ""Heads Up"" thread or the EF concert guide is going to miss out on plenty of things they might like anyway. It contains a mere fraction of what is going on. Compare it to a comprehensive gig guide eg   ,   etc   
Real gig guides exists elsewhere, so I certainly can't be bothered replicating them on EF. Call me selfish if you must, but it only caters for those who like to be.....       
			
			We have the Concert Calendar, we also have the Zurich Gig Guide thread and the Switzerland Gig Guide thread - is this not enough?    
Martin if you want to add Primal Scream into the calendar then go ahead - Mannie Organ decided to post it here and that is entirely her choice but it does not stop you creating an event   
After the demise of the Zurich gig guide some people (me included) missed having a general thread to chat about and mention up and coming gigs.   
I am sure people living elsewhere can still look at at this thread if they see a new post added to it - especially if they are interested in music and are willing to travel - if someone decided to create a Basel Gig Guide I would follow it, just because i Live in Zurich doesn't mean i wouldn't be interested in gigs in other cities   
where's the flogging a dead horse icon for this bleedin topic......
		 
			
			Martin - you groaned Mannie Organ for merely posting a gig that is happening in Zurich in the Zurich Gigs ""heads Up"" thread, do you really believe that deserves a groan? as far as she is aware she is posting in the right place... really some people.....
		    The difference between the EF concerts calendar and a general events website is that the concerts mentioned on here are focused towards the expat community.    
According to your reasoning if information that was already available on the Internet should not be added to the EF then there wouldn't be much content on the EF.   
What I don't understand is why you can't create a Primal Scream Concert thread on the calendar for the 16th August and then have your discussion there: ""Are you going?"", ""No I am going on holiday"", ""Pity because Primal Scream are good"" etc... ?
		    Go for it Martin, very happy for you to go and post the event in the calendar, jeeze I'll do it if it will make you happy?
		    No I groaned at her because she knows of a good concert that could interest other expats but decided not to add it to the Calendar.
		    everytime this thread gets bumped to the top, i think there's a new concert...       I posted it in the Zurich thread because the bloody concert is in Zurich,end of story.          Most of the gigs I go to are with Swiss people. They have remarkably the same taste in music as ""expats"". EF is intended to be a ""Community portal for English-speaking people in Switzerland"", not an expat ghetto.      People do often refer to outside web sources. The real value of EF is in the info that isn't so easy to find, and peoples experience and opinions.      I've not been overwhelmed by the volume of your contributions to this calendar (was it zero or nil?). It's a bit rich to be handing out tit-for-tat groans to contributors and using that as an excuse.
		    That is the whole point of my groan. If you post your comments and information somewhere in the middle of a gigantic Zurich Concerts thread it will not be easy to find.
		     gigantic one and a bit pages.
		    Exactly the problem, and not exactly unexpected.  That is why I wonder why there are mutliple gig threads.  It serves no purpose other than to keep those in Zurich happy and the rest of the board uninformed.
		 
			
			I give up.      see everyone uses things differently, I prefer this way rather than the concerts calendar, the gig is posted and then if no one adds a comment to that event then it gets lost in the pile - whereas I see a new gig added to this and it appears in 'new posts', if i decide i want to go to the event mentioned I put it in my own calendar, I find this solution easier, however i appreciate that you don't, we can't please everyone and I think it will just have to be give and take   
If in the future you see a gig mentioned on this or the other thread and you want to create an event in the concerts calendar then go ahead but don't groan at people if they have chosen this method if that's what THEY prefer   
Nicky
		    For the moment but by August it would theoretically be longer.
		    It's a conspiracy for sure.   
Magnolia Electric Co.  25 Sept  El Lokal , Z*****
		    And why not post it to the general concerts thread?  Do you specificaly not want others to know about it?  Or do you feel too many concerts go on in the rest of the country that it would be lost?
		    Cyrus I didn't post it in here but I actually advised Mannie Organ to post it in here so yes slapped wrist - but it is actually a Zurich concert, not exclusive to Zurichers but it is happening in Zurich - the thread exists and it seemed a suitable place   
I think you are being a bit pedantic over this... is it really all that important? a gig is happening in Zurich and it was posted in the Zurich Gigs 'Heads Up' thread       It is pedantic, but it's not just me being pedantic is it?  I just feel everyone is better of with a general concert thread, but those from Zurich can't seem to post their concerts to a thread that doesn't have the word ""Zurich"" in it.
		    I think 'those' from Zurich can (if they want) Mannie Organ isn't even bloody from Zurich she posted it here because the event is IN Zurich, quite a logical decision do you not think, when confronted with 2 threads, one called Switzerland Gig Guide and the other Zurich Gigs ""heads up""    
Basically don't blame the messenger, it's the mods decision what to do with the two threads and so far they have been left as they are, so...... a user comes along and posts a zurich gig in the zurich gig thread and she gets groaned and hassled about it       
			
			Ok, to summarise:   
There was a Zurich Concerts thread, people weren't happy and made a General concerts thread. Then people weren't happy because gigs in their area were getting lost in the big General concerts thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... People still weren't happy so there was a Concerts forum created.    
People still weren't happy because they could only discuss a particular concert in a thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... then the non Zurich people got pissed off...     
FFS people, no one is going to be happy all the time. Its not the end of the world, get off your high horses (Did Hsiang ever find out where to procure one?) and go to whatever concerts you want to. If a gig is in Zurich why can't the people that live in Zurich discuss it in a Zurich based thread. If they were going to go to a gig in Luzern I'm sure they wouldn't object to it being in a Luzern gigs thread.    
I think a certain amount of ""cop the f**K on"" is needed here.
		    Actually the old Zurich concert threads served well for all concerts in the country, because most concerts happen in Zurich, there were no other threads.  I thought a title change would be appropriate to reflect the actual content of the thread, but obviously, that was just too much.
		    Well then you should have left well enough alone and not tried to fix what was not broken.       But why on earth do you guys have to have these general threads why not simply create an individual thread for each concert and discuss the specifics there.   
That was Nathu's aim when he created the Concerts calendar.   
This reminds of procedural language programmers who couldn't understand object-oriented programming: Now every concert is one object.
		    Because maybe they don't want to!   
You are still perfectly entitled to post the concert in the concerts thread should you so desire.
		 
			
			It's annoying me now how I bang on about it, I understand how some people prefer a single thread and some like the events, but I simply cannot understand why we have 2 seperate stickies simply confusing the issue.     
All gigs posted here will be in Switzerland, most will be in Zurich, why is it so hard to not have a single thread with a title that accurately reflects the contents ""Upcoming Concerts"" or some such, then acts will be picked up by all who might not otherwise consider a trip out of town.  Instead we have 2 threads, or one thread with an inaccurate title.
		 
			
			Now that 50% of the dissenters have annoyed themselves, can we move to the next part of this thread cycle please?   
Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism -> thread users discuss thread -> long period of silence -> thread users think it safe -> Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism ->
		 
			
			Er, I support the use of the Concerts Calendar - which should be merged with the main calendar IMO; let's have a huge 'What's On' section with overview - rather than having lots of different threads.   
There was some arcane rule about not posting an event on the calendar if you weren't intending to attend; surely that's not necessary? Should there be a concert, is it not easier to have it on the calendar? One concert has no relevence to any other and threads like this spin outta control... although something is better than nothing.   
And it's Zürchers, not Zürichers       Oh yes, above it all aren't we? but can't possibly post to a concerts thread without Zurich being in the title.
		 
			
			right i have to dash off to catch a flight very shortly but as an interim would it make everyone happy if I merge this thread with the Switzerland Gig Guide thread and just have the one thread from now on    
The Zurich guide i really don't think was created intentionally to p!ss off Cyrus and Martin but it seems to have done anyway and I think they'll be banging on about it until the cows come home, so I'll merge and we'll just have one generic thread - which will eliminate their the 'them and us' belief   
Agreed?
		 
			
			Right threads merged - it's all a bit of a jumble - i will attempt to edit it when i get chance
		 
			
			I was going to post earlier, but it felt a little childish   
For fans of electro pop, the excellent   are coming to CH   
Stall 6, Zurich, 2/6 and 
Volkshaus, Basel on 3/6
		    Can I now be picky and ask for it to be renamed ""Switzerland Gigs ""Heads Up"" or ""Switzerland Gigs Discussion"" or ""Switzerland Rough Gig Guide""? Cos it aint a gig guide.
		    ah it could have gone in the other thread    
			
			eskimo joe(super aussie band) are playing Bier Huebli in Bern on the 27th October.             
I'm going. anyone from Zurich feel like grabbing a train to Bern check them out?   
(to avoid a sh!t fight based re: the usual argument: Zurich vs rest of the known universe, if someone feels like popping this on the gig-calendar please feel free. i don't know how. :-) )   
they will also be at Gurten for those who are going   
cheers

Ta Taa!   
That'll be a pint, please.
		 
			
			thanks UM.   
event can be found:           
			
			Heard a rumour the amazing Not The Sensational Alex Harvey Band will play in ETH StuZ this September. Not to be missed!
		 
			
			MUSE playing the Hallenstadion in Zurich - Nov 18th... 
Tickets on sale as of today       You've made my day!
		 
			
			B*llocks only seating left!!
		 
			
			Yeah, I think that its because you were only allowed to buy the tickets when they were released if you were a VIP member of ticketcorner.com. Totally sucks as now all the 'ticket dregs' are left. Anyhow, I managed to buy 2 tickets for the UK so will be seeing them there.    
			
			Someone wants to come?           
Thats gonna be my first concert here! Great start    
			
			I wouldn't mind going to see Gossip tonight at Kaufleuten, but they sold out at starticket, does anyone know if they sell tickets on the door?   
I don't want to travel all the way to Zurich and find I can't get in.
		 
			
			A bit short notice but, tonight I can completely recommend both of the bands that will be playing in the restaurant, if it rains, or just outside on the terrace if it doesn't, at the Rote Fabrik. The bands are, in no particular order, Sein and Attwenga. 
Thankyou for your time.
		    5th Dec 09    
			
			Wilco play the Volkshaus on November 11th, tickets from CHF55.-   
Peaches plays 8th September, from CHF55.-   
Goran Bregovic also plays there 23rd April, 2010 ( ) from CHF65.-
		    play the Club at the Theater Spektakel in Zürich Tuesday 18th August, bringing some spooky Ethiopean jazz grooves to the shores of the lake of Zurich. If you weren't in Addis Ababa before 1974, you'll know their music from the Jim Jarmusch film 'Broken Flowers'    
Fire        
			
			This used to work much better when it was a single thread called Zurich Gig Guide 2009 in social events.                      play the Mascotte in Zurich again on December 5th. They're also supporting Muse at the Hallenstadion on November 18th. A good show       It doesn't work because you aren't using the system correctly.
		 
			
			Martin he is using the system how he would like to use it - please quit with groans because someone disagrees with you.   
There are many who no longer benefit from the new system me included - I know a lot of time and effort went into creating the concerts calendar but i feel it is not as effective as the handy gig guide thread we had before. I am finding out about less gigs now because people are just not posting them. It's quick and easy to post on here and many people are short of time and don't wish to create an event.   
So please, we know you don't like this method, but we don't like the other method so can we be grown up and not groan the users who would like to carry on down this route?   
Bannahead thanks for those 3 updates - I am sure in the old system these would have been announced sooner so I hope there are still tickets left for Temper Trap   
Cheers  
Nicky
		    ...It's not that we don't wish to creat an event, but we're following previous rules asking us not to create events if we don't intend / sure if we're going. This is a ""Heads Up"" thread.   
On that note, the rather loud and rocking  play the Rote Fabrik this coming Sunday 20th. Last time they played there were about 7 people in the Ziegel; one was a waiter, one at the bar, two groupies and me and my two mates   A private party!    
There're really quite good, despite the crowds...
		    I agree UM this is why i don't use this calendar event because a) I am unsociable and don't want a crowd tagging along with me at a gig   and b) sometimes I find out about a gig want to tell others but may not be going myself   
I just don't want to get into the whole gigs head up guide v concerts calendar debate again - there was no happy outcome the last time so why can't each person just do as they wish and post a gig ho they want?    
I like this method and it worked for many years and was updated regularly - at least 2 to 3 times a week a new gig would be posted on here and it was always my most favourote thread, it's now died a death and it's a shame    
			
			I haven't posted because I haven't seen anything I liked, it's been quiet over summer.   
Here's a couple to get the thread started again.   
25.10 Micachu and the Shapes / The Invisibles, Zukunft, Zurich   
12.11 Passion Pit, Alte Borse, Zurich   
20.11 The Field, Palace, St. Gallen   
25.11 Massive Attack, Eishalle Deutweg Winterthur   
3.12 Punks Jump Up, Hive, Zurich   
5.12 The Heavy, Palace, St. Gallen
		 
			
			Massive Attack, even antisocial me might be interested in that.       And where do I fit in to that description? I'm still fearful of crossing paths with the FOTL boys after the death look they gave me for buying a bottle of wine at the counter, it was for DaveA I tells ya! Don't think we'll see the likes of a FOTL & Black Mountain ""restaurant"" gig again soon   
Anyways here is my heads up, El Lokal to the rescue in October with varying shades of classy Americana in one hell of a week:   
Oct 18 - Mark Eitzel (American Music Club) 
Oct 22 - Joseph Arthur (last time I saw him was supporting R.E.M.) 
Oct 25 - Richmond Fontaine (Uncut Magazine's favourite story tellers)
		    Oh boy oh boy, Good work, El Lokal       Palace in St Gallen is a very good venue. Dont be scared to stand in front of the ""seat"" people though.        This is your opinion. And you are wrong.   
Along with Nicky, I do not want to reopen the whole Zurich Gig Guide versus Calendar discussion because it got boring very quickly. However, I will not be posting any events         
Sadly I won't be able to attend The XX gig and I am mightily disappointed.
		     
I like the recent albums but I'm not sure how it will work live.
		 
			
			Camera Obscura - 13th Oct - Abart, Zurich   
White Lies - 14th Nov - Kaufleuten, Zurich
		 
			
			Someone here on EF is nutty for them if remember correctly....   
Ultravox - Volkshaus Zurich - 15 April 2010   
with Midge Ure back up front.
		 
			
			It's a good week for indie music in Zürich with Au Revoir Simone on Tuesday and Yacht last night (which was great!).   
This evening Girls are playing at Exil.   
They have an interesting personal history, having grown up in the Children of God cult, being heavily involved with drugs and being adopted by a billionaire . . . or something.   
The music is psychedelic, influenced by the Beach Boys and shoegaze.
		 
			
			Who are the ""Girls"" ?     
as you can imagine, googling is pointless ... what do I google? Girls in Zurich, Girls group, Girls music ...
		 
			
			Anyone interested in seeing Alice In Chains in Fribourg start of december?   
A bit of a different band from their Grunge days, could be interesting
		    Well I did explain a little bit in my original post . . .   
More here:          If only I noticed earlier      
The debut album - imaginatively titled Album - is in the post   
Did you go? Were they good?       
And now for a plug          Unfortunately they started at 11.30 which was a bit late for a school night, so I decided against it.   
In other news . . . Patrick Wolf is playing at Mascotte on Wednesday. Anyone going? Or want to go? If you are it would be nice to meet up . . . PM me.       
			
			FYI - for any Aussies out there Eskimo Joe is playing tonight in Bern at the Bier Huebli           
cheers   
Nic
		 
			
			It would seem that The Joy Formidable are supporting The Temper Trap.   
Check out the video here      
How can you not love this band.
		 
			
			for the U2 fans out there, heard that they'll be playing in zurich next summer... can anyone confirm?
		   I'm looking forward to see KING AUTOMATIC at the longstreet bar 4.11.09 @2100h
Now that is something worth going to see..       I watched their video, what a bunch of w@nkers!
		    Not definitively but I can say the stage diagrams /architect plans have been drawn up (see  ), permission for a concert at Dubendorf Airfield has been granted, and I would expect a concert date sometime in the first half of September 2010 to be announced in the next week or two.
		 
			
			...are playing at the Volkhaus on 28.01.10...(I know I know, that's ages away, but being in CH...)   
I think tickets are around CHF50 , but you'll get excellent riffage for your frank, and the support is sure to be good....       
You know it makes sense!
		 
			
			Looking forward to the Temper trap in a few weeks. Got a few mates coming. Anyone interested in meeting up, PM me
		 
			
			Ian Brown is playing at Abart in Zurich on the 18th January. Tickets are now available.   
Should be a great gig if he manages to keep out of trouble with the dibble between now and then.
		 
			
			I just hope that he doesn't get bottled like  the last time he played Rohstofflager.   
Ian went offstage for a break, the roadies were switching out the Fender guitars and bringing the Gretsches onstage. This suggests the likelihood of an encore filled with Stone Roses songs. He wasn't offstage for more than 3 minutes and the idiots behind started throwing filled cups of beer towards the stage, coating us in the front row and the instruments on stage. They were asked to stop, but the continued. The lights came on the, the roadies got all the gear off stage and the Ian didn't come back on to play an encore that would have included a bunch of Roses tracks   , (as indicated on the setlist i collected)   
I really hope the Abart crowd are a bit more sensible.               is playing at the Salzhaus in Winterthur on Sunday, 22 Nov 2009   
And me sadly up in Germany...
		 
			
			The Living End - Aussie pub rock   
Monday 23 Nov Abart Zurich.   
Any interest?             
			
			Scout Niblett's at Abart on at Exil on December 3rd.   
Dinosaur Egg!
		    will be there with the missus and some mates   
went to high school with these guys       At Abart or Exil?   Put the gin bottle down, man.
		    Naughty Hendricks!   
It'sh Exil . . .       
			
			for those going to Temper Trap on the 2nd Dec - the venue has been changed to the Abart
		 
			
			Living End - what a gig man!!!    
AWESOME !!
		    YEA - it was an amazing show!!! And I liked how the venue was really stretched to it's limit, with a crowd surfer almost kicking down a ceiling-mounted stage light and with the bass literally lifting the roof      
best CHF36 I ever spent in Switzerland    
			
			A great venue for a great Band:   
Stereophonics.  
09.02.2010.  
Palais Xtra. ZH
		 
			
			The Temper Trap is playing at Abart Zurich on 2nd. December. 
Is anyone going as well?
		 
			
			Wow just listened to some Youtube vids (Science of Fear, Sweet Disposition and Fader) and they are pretty damn awesome, in fact very awesome, I really like the sound.   
Abart is 50m from my apartment too. Very tempted, will talk to my friend and look at tickets tommorrow. Thanks for the heads-up man.    
			
			You're welcome. Love Abart as it's a smaller venue AND it has a Bar    
			
			got the tickets as soon as i saw they are in CH. really looking forward to seeing them..
		 
			
			Also already secured my tickets for Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten on 22. February. He's amazing live and it will sell-out really fast. Just to give everyone the head's up.      Same here. Should be rad.    
And yep Xaiver Rudd is a go-a in December. Will bet tickets asap
		 
			
			I'll be there at Temper trap - looking forward to it - shame they changed the venue though
		    Thanks for the heads up...I would've turned up at hafenkneipe blissfully unaware that they had changed the venue otherwise. Oh well, bang goes my 3 minute walk...   
Should be an awesome gig though, can't wait to see them live.
		    ...and bang it goes to Richdog. Abarte is at the end of my street.    
Really looking forward to the gig, booking tickets tommorrow.       But Xavier Rudd is in February next year not December?
		 
			
			oops my bad. May miss it cause i'll be in Australia either feb or march
		 
			
			Biffy Clyro is playing at Mascotte in Zurich this Saturday. 
Also for those who have missed it, Editors are playing at X-tra in Zurich with support by the Maccabees! Should be a great gig.
		    Its annoying that one,we are booked for the editors,but would have really liked to see Biffy Clyro.
		 
			
			Same here. Difficult choices      me too - they supported Muse but really we were so far away and as usual the sound is rubbish in Hallenstadion and especially for the support acts. Would have been good to see them in a smaller venue   
see you Sat Mrs O
		 
			
			see you in the bar.
		 
			
			Just seen Filastine is playing at exil in Zurich tomorrow (Friday).  Think that might be mighty interesting.
		     
4th February   at abart   
10th March   at rohstofflager
		    She must have liked it here last time!
		 
			
			David Grey for anyone interested   
X-tra 7th Feb
		    I missed both these on their first visit, hopefully get to see them both on their second
		    Cool i might be keen for that
		 
			
			Gentleman & the Evolution are playing at Maag Event Hall in Zurich on 20th April 2010. Bit far off but tickets will sell fast.    
Gentleman is pretty amazing live!
		 
			
			John Butler Trio coming April 25th 2010 at Maag MusicHall AG  
unfortunately i'll be on a plane to Oz then    
Venue phone: 044 444 26 26.  
Pre-Sale Tix on sale 16th December 10AM
		 
			
			Jase you just made my day!   
I love John Butler Trio, saw them live at Gurten Festival.  
Will get my tickets asap     
Another heads up:   
RJD2 is playing in Bern in May.       
			
			12 March, Zurich, Volkshaus -    bringing his upcoming   work.   
Brothers and sisters in true music, this gig is a keeper of keepers.  I have heard some tasters from the CD, read reviews from in the know people who I trust with their musical opinions, and it promises to be a deep human  , esp. in these obtuse times on the planet earth.  And believe me I have seen Pat Metheny many times (more than any other artist perhaps including Joe Zawinul in the same company) since 1978, so this is full-hearted endorsement.   
If you saw   tour of 1992, and   in 2005, then this tour has the potential to outpass these two extra dimensional gigs.  Metheny is a musician/composer/human being for our times and for all times.   
Here's a neat interview with Metheny       Is RJD2 playing his low tech hip hop stuff (ie. since we last spoke/Dead ringer) or his indie singer-songwriter stuff? cause im not so found of his new direction.   
Edit: Also keen to check out DJ Vadim on Feb 5th if anyones going

			Dans le sac vs Scroobius pip play at Sudpol, Luzern 28th Jan.       
For those of you who haven't heard of them before, well worth a listen.    
There are also sections of spoken word from ""Scroobius pip""        
tickets are only 30.00   
Should be a great show
		    They played at Hafenkneipe in Zürich last year.  They must like it here.

I would like to meet people going to the concert?   
Cheers
		 
			
			Thanks for the James Blood Ulmer tip nice!   
I have tickets for the great Element Of Crime next week but i heard its sold out.
		 
			
			Hey people   
sorry for the last minute question, but is anyone going to the concert of Angélique Kidjo in Kaufleuten on Saturday? I'll be there with 2 friends and thought it would be a good ocassion to meet some of you     =   
All the best

Although it's on a Monday  , I'll definitely see her       will be in Zurich (Kaufleuten) on Tuesday, the  !   
Would love to see her... too bad that it's so far and on a Tuesday       will take place from the 7th to the 10th of April in Crans Montana (Valais).   
The program is available here:       
I've never been so far but I might go there on the Friday evening.   and   should be interesting.       I love air but not sure how much tickets are. I thought theyd be expensive because they're crazy popular in Australia
		 
			
			Btw: Does anyone know where I can get tickets to the Stall6 gigs? Im trying to find DJ Vadim tickets online but it seems to be the biggest run around
		    I think you can just email   to reserve tickets . . .
		 
			
			cheers mate
		 
			
			The Blood Arm are playing in Albani Club, Winterthur on 23rd Feb and Bar 59, Luzern 24th. I have seen this band twice in London, and they put on the most entertaining shows of any band I have ever seen.    
Go see them!   
(And if anybody is going to be driving to either one from the Grindelwald area, please let me know...)       Great!!! I'll be there...  Tickets available at:    
(40chf  )
		    Bar 59 is a cool little spot, might go check them out.     
La Roux is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, on the 7th March.
		    Damn, apparently it's sold out.  Anyone want rid of their tickets?
		    Do Kaufleuten normally have additional tickets on the door?
		    Don't know, but would like to find out.
		 
			
			More gigs I would like to go to (but need to work out if I can get back from Zurich on a school night  ):   
Hockey 16 Feb 10 Abart     
Vampire Weekend, May 28 2008   Zurich <-- so errr ignore that, as it's way out of date (Thanks bananahead for spotting!)
		     
Hey Kirsty, you do realise that it is 2010 this year?                 
But they were good    
			
			hmm thanks for pointing out my stupidity... but I would have liked to go! This was my vain search for bands I really like playing in Switzerland, and I turned up... 2   And one of those was 2 years ago! (It said past performances in teeny tiny writing - you can't blame me for getting over excited and missing that!)   
Harumph, so just hockey then...
		     
Hi there, 
You can buy them in Ticket corner,  they are 60.60 CHF general entrance, 
it is not that expensive. 
Are you going? 
Alex
		    The missus might be sorting tickets atm. Will let you know if we are
		    Hockey is ausverkauf.   
I'm not sure if they will have tickets on the door at Abart.
		 
			
			Muse are playing at Stad de Suisee in Bern on 2nd June 10

			Kitsuné faves Two Door Cinema Club are playing on January 27th at Ziegel au Lac.       
			
			Coming 27 Jan to the D! Club,   - the one and the only   for a  !!!!  Can not make it for professional commitments in other parts of the continent, but it promises to be da BOMBE.  Such a precocious talent.  A voice and presence        
Check out this clip from 1995 in London.  Whatever you do please stay in your seat...........!!!!!!!!!!       
			
			infected mushroom are playing feb 13 @      
they always seem to be changing style, better than being stagnant I guess, and I'll probably go check it out
		     
I thought he went by the name of Senanda Maitreye these days?   
P.S to save others searching the D Club location as I just did   it's in Lausanne
		 
			
			As a heads up, we actually have a concerts calendar as an option on the main forum calendar. It's somewhat lost because one has to scroll down and change the options to see it - we're working on simplifying this - but  anyway. As these lists get longer and longer, perhaps it'd be useful for others to know from the calendar if you're intending to go. It'll allow a bit of buzz for the event and let others know who's attending.
		     
Nicky, he sure has but thought to put his former name out to those who remember him from 1987 when he came out with  rby album, and several others after until he changed his name to Sananda Maitreya in 2001.   
My bad, I put Lausanne in the Title block but not in the main text!   
Anybody been to the D! Club in, of course, Lausanne?   
			
			Terrence Trent Darby used to be on my wall as a teenager, would love to see him if he did his hold stuff, alas Lausanne a bit too far..
		 
			
			I think I might go to this.    
Will just have to stay up all night and get the first train home  .
		 
			
			Nicky n Natasha   
I think he will play some of the older charts and newer ones too.   
Maybe he is on tour and coming to your area?  I had no idea about this Lausanne gig until I read it in   this Saturday morning.   
Or if you would like a very nice youth hostel near the lake in Lausanne here it is.  Highly recommended and very reasonably priced.  Think 39 chf room with breakfast       
			
			Recently discovered  covering concerts in Switzerland (landlockedblues). May be of interest to see who's around and get the er, skinny. (Is that right? Skinny? Is that still in?)
		 
			
			Deep Purple have you seen this?

			Just seen Trentemoeller is at Hive club tomorrow night (13th)
		 
			
			New Young Pony Club at Hive club on 26th April.       
			
			Woot woot!  Hockey at Abart tomorrow.   
It's total ausverkauf, but it might be worth turning up to get tickets on the door.
		 
			
			Tindersticks are playing Kaufleuten, Zurich on May 5th.   
Miserable feckers. Great live.
		 
			
			It looks like tickets are available on the door for Hockey.   
Doors open at 7.30 . . .
		 
			
			There's a free gig tonight at   by  .   
It starts at 22.00       
			
			The White Lies gig for tonight has been cancelled.   
""Dearest fans. Charles from White Lies here. Im am so so sorry to say that we have to cancel tomorrows show in Munich and the following day in Zurich because Harry has picked up a very nasty viral infection which has destroyed his voice. He's seen doctors from various parts of Europe over the last few days and overdosed on every steroid/anti-inflamatory and pain-killer we could get hold of. But it hasn't worked and today we had to come off stage in Vienna after only 3 songs. We're so sad to have to re-schedule these two shows once again. We had been looking forward to them since December. Please be assured that we will still play these shows for you as soon as we finish the next album and by then have exclusive new songs for you. Love from us all. C W/L""       
(Credit to Dan for spotting this!)
		   are playing at Moods in Zürich as part of the M4Music festival. Saturday, 27th March at 23.00   
Goody goody
		 
			
			anyone going to Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten tonight?
		    A definite Yes!!!       Me, too, me too!
		    Hadouken are a good live act. Noisy fun.   
Very polite young chaps too.   
Here are some photos I took when I saw them in London in 2008:           
			
			Eminem, Jay-Z, Fantastischen Vier, Jan Delay, Stress,...whole bunch others:   
Frauenfeld-weekend of the 9th July.
		 
			
			Gogol Bordello on May 26th in Zurich:       
I unfortunately will be out of town.  
I've seen them once before in concert and they are absolutely amazing....
		 
			
			Faithless are coming to Zurich!    
April 27th at Vilkshaus       
			
			R Kelly will be in Basel the 3rd of April:          Lock up your 15 year old daughters!    
			
			Right, bought my John Butler Trio Tickets for 25th April. 
Can't wait!! Anyone know who support band is?
		 
			
			Benga comes to Bern on the 3rd of April at Reitschule.   
Haven't yet been to a pure dubstep night, this seems like one to go for.  Might be my first night out in Bern too.
		 
			
			Mos Def 24th April at Rote Fabrik. Have put an event in the  .
		 
			
			The Reverend Horton Heat (USA),  Fr 02.04.2010, Zurich       
highly recommended. i've seen them 3 times and if it were not for the concert being in zurich, i'd be there again.    
			
			Damn, sometime I miss living in Zurich...Les Claypool at the Abart club on 10 March.        
			
			Pink Martini a the Kaufleuten 15th July     
			
			and Cat Empire at Schutzenhaus Uetliberg, Zürich           
I guess the title of his tour (""Ladies make some noise"") tells it all    
			
			An hip hop event during Easter in Zurich. It will be the fisrt edition.   
Method Man, The Beatnuts, De la Soul, IAM, Diam's, Hocus Pocus and more performing between the 2nd of April and the 4th of April.             
Imogen Heap is playing tommorow night at Abart, I think tickets are still available.   
			
			I almost bought tickets for      =   
but I'm not sure.    
Opinion anyone?
		 
			
			Posting on behalf of a friend of mine, he organises Stoner rock bands to come over here.  Rock isn't normally my thing but I've hugely enjoyed every concert he put on.   
Locations are either Sedel or the Blues Bar, both in Luzern.  Sedel is the old womens prison, just outside of town, Blues Bar is a tiny room at the back of a latin nightclub, just past schuur.               
			
			Ash are playing Abart on 25th May     
Last time I went to see them was at the University of London Union...seem to remember the night ended up with me drinking Snakebite and Blacks, whilst arm wrestling students...not quite had a similar experience in Switzerland so far...
		 
			
			The Strokes, Stone Temple Pilots, Billy Talent, LCD Soundsystem, NOFX, Wolfmother, 30 Seconds to Mars, White Lies, Kasabian:   
24-27 June, St Gallen.   
Gonna be a rough weekend!
		    Yeah . . . especially without any decent bands        
*GROAN*   
sorry DJ Bobo wasn't available, he's kinda hard to get a hold of this time of the year
		    Well, I'd probably give LCD Soundsystem the time of day . . .   
And I note that The Strokes have a new album out in 2010.   
Not the freshest line up though, is it?
		 
			
			Yeah, I'm really going for the Strokes and STP (and I have a gulity pleasure for Billy Talent too, but I'm in therapy for it).   
The rest will just be cool filler, perhaps some surprises.
		 
			
			Huge Euro festivals suck. Small festivals suck harder. It's all a big con to get us to consume more product. Bring back touring.
		    What you want is small 'conference' festivals in towns:  SXSW, Stag and Dagger, The Great Escape
		    What I want is a seven foot blond chick with natural curves and green eyes who'll turn into a pizza at 3am, but I appreciate your sentiment.
		    Certain to be available at all the above events, if you do them right.
		    Ahhh I saw Ash at the Astoria last year. It was great. I will try and get along to this one. It's a school night though    
Happy memories of ULU... They used to do the best nachos to go with your snakebite!
		 
			
			I've seen Ash 3 or 4 times at various stages of their career and they have yet to be less than awesome   Best time was in a little venue in Hastings and Silver Sun were the support.   
Ah, Silver Sun - their debut album was fantastic!!
		 
			
			Saxon - Z7 - Thursdsay night.
		 
			
			Blood Red Shoes at Abart on March 29th          Indeed           
Looking forward to it lots.
		    please tell your friend to send some of these bands to lausanne...      concert cancelled !!!
		 
			
			The Moon and Stars' festival (in Locarno) programme is available:       
Too bad that Locarno is that far!!!   
I hope that JK will give another concert elswhere in Switzerland       Would go to see LCD, STP and Wolfmo but the FREAKIN World Cup is on, priorities priorities.    
I see the Gurten has Faith No More headlining - enough said. Wont be going to see that rubbish again.
		    They'll be showing all the matches from big screens so it won't be that you'll have to miss anything....btw Mike Patton is GOD!
		    To be honest its the WorldCup, I need to be comfortable when Im watching the Greatest Show on Earth!   
Hmmm MP is a deity huh... The Real Thing is their seminal album granted, in fact I still regularly listen to it, but their material got progressively Pattonised (weird and experimental in want of actual music) culminating in the God awful Mr Bungle. Discuss...
		     
I don't know how I can discuss such ignorance politely    
Different strokes I suppose and if you prefer the Mike Patton that sings Lionel Richie covers then so be it... I guess I couldn't interest you in his work with John Zorn then       No need to be polite, we are discussing Patton after all. Angel Dust was after The Real Thing, and about the time I started to loose interest. Jizzlobber was the last straw. Terrible.
		 
			
			I for one am stoked to see FNM headlining the Gurten Festival!!!    
btw...   
epic < angel dust < king for a day < album  of the year   
tomahawk is also awesome.   
peeping tom is really good too.    
mr bungle and fantomas are acquired tastes but absolutely incredible live.
		     
what's a world cup?         
Sorry, not my thing
		    Unfortunately this world cup is not played with sticks so guess your national team didnt qualify, u could always support the USA       He does a great job, I'll post them up in events shortly, but if you'e a big fan of any of the bands, it'd worth the trip to Luzern.  Both venues are very small and you get right up close to the band.
		 
			
			Soccer world cup? I know what id rather do..... Anything. But then again I'll watch anything when im loaded   
Anyone going to this M4 music thingo tomorrow? Keen to see Jose Gonzalez again. Last time I saw him the sound was awful and it was a horrible setup
		    Jeff Beck!
		    yeah but in support of ZZ Top? ewww....      
but i will say tho that Jeff Beck was amazing at Montreux Jazz Festival a couple years ago. probably my favorite guitarist evah!    
			
			FYI Paleo Festival has announced their lineup....meh           
besides Iggy & the Stooges & Indochine... meh indeed
		    Two Door Cinema Club and We Have Band are worth seeing.   
Foals are very definitely worth seeing . . . amazing live performers.  Klaxons too.   
I'll happily dance to Vitalic and Yuksek.   
N*E*R*D pretty good live too.
		    So I can see what snazzy dressers they are? Sorry, generic ""indie"" music bores me nowadays. Good point about N.E.R.D. & Vitalic though.
		    There's a big difference between TDCC and something like Coldplay or the Kooks.  There's electronica and afro-pop in there.  Yes, they're snappy dressers, but that's part of the deal if you sign to Kitsuné.  Not sure how they'd come across on a festival stage though.
		     
Which they stole from Vampire Weekend, who stole it from Paul Simon, who stole it from Fela Kuti. Shame he's dead now...
		    . . .  who stole it from someone else in Africa . . . etc etc blah blah blah   
You think there's a chance of completely ahistoric music with no antecedents?  And that bands shouldn't use some of the same sounds and influences?  TTCM fall some way in between Vampire Weekend and Foals, but have their own sound.  Vampire Weekend are more preppy/New England.  Foals miss out the Afro-pop, but have some of the same kind of indie-dance and free range guitar.
		    meh indeed
		   26.05.2010: Foals @ Abart, Zurich  
Tickets are available from    
			
			Port O'Brien playing in Zurich, Basel and Luzern this weekend. I have seen them in Dublin before and they were great live! Recommend.   
Hopefully they will still make it despite volcano issues!
		 
			
			Stevie Wonder at Moon and Stars on 7th July.
		 
			
			Crystal Castles at rohstofflager, Zürich on the 27th April, might try and make that.
		    play the Idaplatzfest in Zurich, 21st August, showcasing their second album      Perhaps      playing this Friday night at 8pm at Kaufleuten Zurich.
		 
			
			Not sure if it's already pegged in here, but The Eels are playing in Winterthur on August 28th, supported by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  Tix are 54 CHF from Starticket.   
Also the night before, Paolo Nutini is playing the same spot.   
Looks like an open air music week in old town Winterthur, should be cool. (Events already created for both in the Concerts calendar)
		 
			
			I've created a social event in the calendar for the Tunng gig on Wednesday.
		 
			
			this looks promising:        
at least for friday night.       What is it about the Swiss and Skunk Ananse?? 
Every other country got tired of them in weeks!   
The Eels looks promising!
		     
When you figure that out please explain to me their fascination with Amy Macdonald.   
It's just Eels btw, no ""the""
		     Cool, miss living there.
		    Anyone fancy it, or already going?
		    Er . . . that was last night wasn't it?
		    May, no?   
(too short)
		    Ooops . . .  I am living in the future!     (Yes . . . there are flying cars here and everything)   
			
			This looks good, an open-air festival for Zurich at long last.  i'll be there for Underworld and Booka Shade.  I'll try for Placebo but tradition dictates I turn up right at the end of their encore...          I've posted an event for this:       
			
			Bump for the Tindersticks playing at Kaufleuten tonight. Anyone else in?
		 
			
			Jimi Tenor and Tony Allen at the Kaserne tonight (8/5/10). Tony Allen was the band leader for Fela Kuti, but his solo stuff since then is less of the traditional afrobeat. Fans of experimental rock and jazz should check it out!
		 
			
			They obviously like it here     
mo. 29.11. -  - abart
		   Mike Patton's Mondo Cane   Thursday , 29.07.2010   20h00  Luzern (CH)  KKL Luzern - Konzertsaal    
			
			A.R Rahman concert 
Hallenstadion Zurich 
16 July        thanks for posting. that would be a VERY interesting show to see.    
but it seems like most concert announcements just make me realize i'm on the wrong side of switzerland.       Foals were amazing last night.  Tracks from the second album are generally more contemplative than those from the first and therefore less appropriate for a live performance.  The old/new split was about 70/30.  It's just incredible the way the band plays together . . . precise but intensely passionate.  Many times throughout the gig I just went 'wow'.  The final song, 'One Step, Two Step' left the crowd on a high.
		 
			
			not sure if anyone has posted it yet, but Slash is touring his new album in June. He's playing X-tra on the 16th of June. Miles Kennedy is on vocal duties.   
from what i've read they are playing a healthy mix of tracks from Slashs' back catalogue and the new stuff.  i'm really looking forward to this one.           
			
			Another overlooked festival, just saw a poster for it...Neuchatel Open Air.   
Cypress Hill! Looks like a nice location too.        
			
			What about the   in Lucerne   
Shame about the name.... I think its for the sexually frustrated
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this but....      - Abart, Monday 5th July, CHF35   
Fo sho!
		    Oh how gutted i was to hear this was on the 5th July, the day i go on holiday! VERY gutted
		    damn have my mother here from Oz that week. Might take her with us    
			
			Almost missed this one, John Garcia plays Kyuss at Schuur tonight (2nd June), Luzern.
		 
			
			i'm going to see them tomorrow in lausanne. i didn't bother posting coz i really didn't think there was anyone here interested.   
should i also mention baroness is playing in fribourg in july? my new favorite band.    
			
			A band I know will be playing Thu, June 10 in Stall 6. 
African Percussions and a singer from Gambia. 
P-Train & Lamine Jobarteh.   
CHF 10.-            
			
			The Kissaway Trail the highlight (for me) of this year's For Noise festival in Pully (near Lausanne).       
			
			I'm surprised no one has mentioned Prince in Geneva on 12 July.        
			
			Not sure if this has already been mentioned   
29th Sept Hallenstadion    
I am so there!   
Tickets for ticket corner members went on sale today, general public tomorrow I think, many pre sales tickets already sold out so get up early tomorrow folks    
			
			Say what now? I thought I knew you! interwebz-wise.       stick with me Debz and i'll show you the way    
come on who can not be a Peter Gabriel fan?
		             
anyone born after 1980       Phil Collins fans?
		 
			
			anyone coming to Bsides festival today?
		 
			
			Possibly, keeping an eye on the weather.
		    Damn . . . didn't spot that.  Not sure if I can come now.   
Three Trapped Tigers are excellent.
		 
			
			Hmmmm . . . Crystal Fighters are playing at the Imagine Festival in Basel tomorrow.       
Am I right in thinking this is free?   
Anyone else going?
		     
it is free, might be going.
		 
			
			I've already booked and paid for my Guns n Roses tickets.   
Geneva, 16th September at the Arena (beside the Airport)
		 
			
			I'm probably a bit slow off the mark, but Mumford and Sons are playing (with Sophie Hunger) the Montreux JF on 14th July. Tickets are note available on the ticketcorner site but, unlike other, it is not marked as sold out on the Montreux site.   
I'm also very tempted by Julian Casablancas with Vampire Weekend but at 80.- it's a bit steep. There are tickets available for that though.   
Does anyone know where else I might be able to get tickets? I can get to Montreux to buy them next week if this is necessary...   
Merci d'avance!

			Its not a Swiss gig so please don't shoot me down but we are off Wed to Belgium to what I reckon is the BEST open air festival in the world.....   
Werchter Festival is so damn well organised and has a solid line up every year. Just 8 hours drive. You can't beat it peoples.   
ROCKONAUSTRALIA !!!        decent festival but Primavera destroys all
		 
			
			careful with your ears, folks.    
my last concert, john garcia plays kyuss, might be my last concert.    
since then, i have tinnitus. BAD. this sucks.    
i will post up some tinnitus info at some point but please take care of your ears.

		    Nice!  I may have to think about this... haven't had my fill of weird yet this year.    One of my all-time favorites:   
[maybe this should be in song of the day...]   
But on a Tuesday?!? Come on!   
EDIT: Anyone here planning to go?  I am so up for it but pretty sure my roomie wouldn't be interested...
		 
			
			Baby was a black sheep, baby was a whore. Baby got big but she's gonna get bigger..... Anyone going to see Patti Smith in the Rote Fabrik on Wednesday? 
I really hope she only plays old songs, but it's not too far to walk home if she does.
		 
			
			here's an 'under-the-radar' festival...in grandson VD...          Oh man, missed that and probably can't go now.   
Love this song:       
			
			It'll be outside, on the lakeside, so you could in theory, come watch the football, outside, and listen to her in the background. It's going to be quite a night! I'll be up on the roof!        I really should be but the devil on my left shoulder told me to go watch football instead.
		 
			
			Rodney Branigan at the Cava.....     
			
			anyone interested in Baroness at Bad Bonn (Düdingen), 13 July? I got some super dooper expensive earplugs to try out.        
			
			Patti was legendary. The lake was magnificent, and Germany lost. Was that the perfect night?        crap i just saw this! i love patti smith- seen her a ton of times and poetry stuff too... wish i knew i'd have definitely gone...   
i've even got a gorgeous photo of her holding my then 6month old son at a poetry event in nyc... wah. a bit sad now i need to keep up on these things...   
			
			I want to be half that cool when I'm 62!       I would have loved to have gone , but I got the feeling that you would have got the weird Patti doing performance art versions of stuff, rather than the angry Horses version ... 
If it was the later then I wish I had gone !
		    was incredible.                
			
			T'was the latter. I expected a post-menapausal, I know it all and I'm gonna pass on the word Patti, but she rocked! Right up til her final song, which was rock and roll nigga. Having said that, she didn't actually do horses.     
			
			The Coral are playing Abart on November 2nd   
Should be a really good gig and tickets are only 35CHF       
			
			Mike Patton fans- Mondo Cane will be in Lucerne the 29th at the  .

24.09. kate nash @ kaufleuten, zurich 
11.10 mystery jets @ abart, zurich 
19.10 the cinematics @ hafenkneipe, zurich

sif you would go to Helmet. ffs its HELMET!!!!
		     
almost word for word what a friend said to me when he saw that    
Xiu Xiu in St Gallen in November..
		 
			
			ooh, i'd like to see those Drums in action.  (is the day before my birthday too, sounds like a good excuse for a big friday night)   
i'd be interested in seeing kate nash covered in whipped cream and lip-synching too, but only for laughs             A very good excuse indeed! It would be nice to see you there ... I've got my ticket ...      Yep, I agree, only for laughs, but as I do not like the location, I most probably skip that one.
		 
			
			i have just been informed that the Scissor Sisters are playing the on the 15th of November.          HELL YEAH!    
but that's a looong drive for a tuesday night.      
holy crap! after a quick search they are playing in Yverdon on Dec 1st. STOKED!
		    hope they are better than when they were at hallenstadion, worst gig in my history of gigs and i only had to endure half of it
		    I'll buy ya a beer, so take the train    
			
			02.12.2010 gossip @ x-tra, zurich 
info:   (german)
		 
			
			I see Booker T is playing  tomorrow (21st July). Rather peeved to only spot this now, plus to have to miss it due to soccerball.
		    wish i could. you're very lucky to have the abart. when i lived in zurich, i only saw 3 concerts there (in 3 years) due to working so much and just being out of the loop. recently i went and looked at the history of who has been there since i left in 2001 and thought i was gonna be sick.    
king's x at the abart was one of my favoritist shows ever.    
			
			Here's a few gigs that might be of interest in the ""near"" future:   
Pendulum 30/09 Xtra CHF45   
Goldfrapp 05/10 Xtra CHF60   
The Coral 02/11 Abart CH37   
Carl Barat (The Libertines, Dirty Pretty Things) 09/11 Mascotte CHF46

Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan 26/11 Kaufleuten CHF48   
Blood Red Shoes 29/11 Abart CHF35     Sorry for any repeats!   
			
			Pendulum, oh boy, might have to get in early on that one..
		 
			
			Kap Bambino at X-Tra in Zürich this Friday!       
(not sure that's the best of venues though)
		 
			
			It's notable how many bands return to Zürich soon after playing here.  Dan mentioned Blood Red Shoes above, Beach House too.  Do they think it's cool here or is it the strong CHF?   
Here's another returner . . . Au Revoir Simone at Abart on August 23rd, they were good at Stall 6 last September.   
Other acts that may or not be returning:   
Mystery Jets at Abart on 11th October

			Don't know if it is already mentioned, but Iron & Wine is playing on the 16th of September at El Lokal, Zürich.          SO SAD I WILL MISS THAT!      Tonight the YOUNG GODS are playing for FREE!!!!

at Club Zukunft, Kreis 4 in Zürich (right next to Langstrasse) this thursday 9th of september. Kickoff at 23:00. 
Eintritt Frei!
		    Paging Gastro Gnome...that thoroughly nice chap is playing for free    
Sadly I'll be somewhere else...   
Oh, and I assume you mean September instead of October       Funnily enough I've met Gilles a couple of times through a friend.  She was visiting London from Estonia and was a big fan of worldwide.  She went to his club and got chatting to him.  He invited her to his house the next day and sent her off with a load of vinyl . . . she went back to Tallinn and became a DJ.  Nice chap.   
Have I already told you that story before?
		     
nice lil' story which doesn't amaze me all that much. Peterson seems like such a nice bloke at least on the radio show    
I might make the drive out ... Zükunft is such a great little club with an awesome vibe and the woodblock prints for announcing the nights
		    I'm not sure you got to the vinyl bit as those pesky Foals were a playing there thingys awfully loud    
*worldwide worldwide worldwide*
		    Ah yes . . . it's all coming back to me . . .
		 
			
			Is anybody heading to Rote Fabrik on Saturday to see The Maccabees?   
It's free from what i can understand of this-        
I might be if I can get out of prior arrangements
		 
			
			Pink Floyd fans should be headed to Dietikon, ZH Saturday evening 9-18-10:          Brilliant!  Yeah . . . I'd like to go and see them.

See    
			
			The Morning Benders tonight at Salzhaus Winterthur   
support is the fantastic Sheila She Loves You from Basel
		 
			
			I can't believe I just read about Maccabees now it now. 
They are pretty cool!
		    It was an excellent gig, more so for being free.  We should lobby them to return.
		 
			
			The brilliant band The Wedding Present are playing on the 31 october in the Mariaberg in Rorschach:     
...why Rorschach       And they're playing Bizarro!?!?!?!?!   
Hmmm . . . might have to look at a hotel there . . .
		    Yes might be an option.    
Not doable on public transport as the last train departing towards Zurich leaves at 22.40.   
Why don't they play at the Volkshaus in Zurich like normal bands do?  
Don't get their marketing strategy?!   But then if they ever had a marketing strategy they'd be a world famous band by now.
		    Their biggest marketing push, as far as I remember, was quite perverse and involved releasing a seven inch single for every month of 1992.  I had 'em all, but have somehow lost track of them.       too much apple pie, Tubbs           
I just checked them out - thanks for the tip - I love them!!  Shame they don't have more dates up on their calendar but I will keep an eye out.  Hope there are more bands like them around - gives me hope    
			
			Nothing beats   for finding out what's on. 
You filter by date, price, distance willing to travel, can link to other social sites etc..
		    How do I see everything in Zürich.   
It just came back with this limited selection:        Hmmm . . . I tried registering.   
Does it only show you bands you track?      I've just spent ten minutes getting nothing but frustrated with that site.  I simply want to see what's on in Zürich.  Instead it seems I have to track a load of bands.  Can't I just track Zürich?
		    Don't know if you meant Sheila she loves you or the morning benders but if it was the first they are playing in La Catrina in Zürich tmw evening for   good idea to get there a bit early though as it fills up quickly.
		    They usually play at least 3 times a year in Switz anyhow..
		    Who told you that? The Wedding Present have hardly ever played 3 times a year in Switzerland (if ever).
		    Yes - Shelia she loves you - I won't be in Switzerland until the 11th October but will checking out all the bands and venues.  Do the gigs usually finish in time to catch the last train back from Zurich to Basel?  Here in scotland there are some venues that run 7 to 10 pm and last train is about 11pm but most venues run to midnight or later.
		    Well if you're moving to Basel I'm sure you'll have plenty of chances to see them. Most venues try to finish in time for the last train but it doesn't always work out.
		    Perhaps slightly exaggerated but they do come through quite often. I know for sure they've played Sommercasino in Basel several times.
		     
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finntroll @ Konzertfabrik Z7 - Dec 12!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't know that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank the holy lord that I was browsing this thread!!!!! One of my current favorite Bands of all time... Slightly strange coincidence too.   
So um, anybody else going?    
			
			Black Rebel Motorcycle Club @ Zurich Volkshaus November 14th   
Can find it listed everywhere but can't find tickets yet...
		   , Luzern on the 15th of October, unfortunately I'll miss it as I'm DJ at Bar 59 the same night.
		 
			
			for those in Lausanne. BRMC are also playing at a festival on the 13.11.2010       
can't find Zurich tickets yet either, but i'll be there.         
			
			Zurich tickets from ticketcorner.ch                   
there you go.
		 
			
			Nick Cave and the Grindermen will be playing at the Folkshaus next Tuesday in Zürich. Anyone else going?
		 
			
			Just click on ""view concert cloud"" and it should show everything that meets your filtered criteria (assuming you've told it where you are)

Shellac is playing in Bern on the same day , a bit torn between the two.If he would be singing bad seeds songs it would be easier.
		 
			
			Tell me about it! I'm immersing myself in Grinderman, to get used to it so I won't be too confused on the day. Having said that, they may do a couple of their badseed songs.       
			
			Dollhouse (SWE) play mascotte today (tuesday)- starts around 20h and some norwegian band will open for them.
		 
			
			Karma to Burn 
Les Caves du Manoir 
Martigny   
Deftones 
Frison 
Fribourg   
Bandsintown.com is pretty cool but has some limitations. I'd like to be able to opt out specific locations (like Zurich and anything in France) and it would be cool if you could feed it a list of bands from your music collection. Aside from that a nice utility. A friend told me about something similar that works with your itunes collections, feeds your band names into a database and returns upcoming concerts for bands in your collection plus similar bands.
		    How was the show?      Thank you!   
27th October @            
			
			Not sure if its been mentioned but a band from my home town in Australia are playing on Nov 5. Really Psychedelic but pretty decent the only time ive seen them    
Tame Impala 
Nov 5 @ Mascotte, Zurich
		 
			
			Club night rather than gig: Nu:Tone (Hospital Records)* & Stamina MC are playing at Kaserne, Basel on Sat 23rd Oct:    
Will be heading over from Zurich, anyone else going?   
* UK Drum and Bass producer and DJ
		 
			
			A bit disapointing to be honest. Maybe it was just too early in the tour. Some of it worked, some of it was a disaster. Nick was looking alot like Bunny Munroe.        Hmm. I saw him in Liverpool once; someone shouted ""C'mon Phil Collins"" and he never recovered. To think he let Kylie slip from his arms...
		 
			
			I don't want to talk about         I've met stamina at a house party once. Hes a cool dude. I could make it out for this one. I love hospital artists
		 
			
			Anyone going to see Santana tonight? My old man (who is a good laugh) is going by himself and he probaly wouldn't mind meeting up with some fellow old skool fans.       Anyone going to the Deftones show in Fribourg?  Has anyone been to that venu; is it large, small etc?  Thanks!
		    depending on which hall they use it can hold anywhere from 300 to about 3000 people. Considering it's the Deftones I'd imagine it would be the larger one. Frison is one of the best concert venues in Switz imo. One drawback to it though is that if you're in Basel or ZH it's often difficult to get back home with the train if you wanna stay till the end of the concert.
		    i'm going!    
i saw mastodon there last spring and i enjoyed it but have to say the acoustics there are pretty bad. there are certain spots where the reverberations from the big walls will turn the music into a horrible constant roar. a few feet to the left or right and it's ok again. also, there are no elevated viewing areas (all just a big floor) so if you are on the short side it might not be ideal. otherwise, i like the old warehouse style of venue.
		    Hmm, well i'd be comming from Basel so i guess i should start to look for someone with a car (if anyone is going anway?) or try and find a place to stay.  I wish there were better concert venues in Basel!  Thanks for the info!
		     
a friend of mine might be going with a car. Ask me when the time comes.
		    Cool, I'll prob catch the train over in the eve, let me know if you want to meet up.
		 
			
			Saw sharon jones and the dap kings last night @ kaufleuten and they were amazing. Invited two of my mates and they also raved about the show.   
First time ive been to kaufleuten too. Really cool venue. Might be a little posh for me though    
			
			Anyone going to see   on Friday?  Let me know, I'm going with another lady friend by train from Zurich hb.
		 
			
			The excellent Bonobo is playing a few dates in Switzerland 
Les Docks, Lausanne on 8/12 
Moods, Zurich on 17/12 
Sudpol, Luzern on 18/12   
I'll be going to the Luzern one for sure.

Thursday November 4th Seu Jorge & Almaz @ ROTE FABRIK

Or only CHF33 from Starticket
		    Ooh! Ooh!  I would totally join for Seu Jorge! But I'll be out of town.  
Ah well, next time. 
Let me know how the show is; never seen him live and most of the albums I love of his are *quite* a few years old.
		    Check out his  stuff!  
If you haven't already seen the LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU you must.
		    Balls. Im back home for Xmas. Bonobo is dooooooope
		 
			
			is there anyone interested in two free tickets to KARMA TO BURN playing in Martigny on Nov 3rd? i can't go now due to other plans. i hate to see good tickets go to waste...PM me if interested.
		     
Decent band and nice guys. I would take those tickets off you if only 1) I knew where Martigny was, and 2) David Max and the Sons of Void weren't playing in Basel and Spectrum weren't playing in Basel on the same night.
		 
			
			i was all set to drive an hour to martigny to see them, bought 2 tickets for me and a friend, then later discovered that i had mistaken the date and have another concert (public enemy) on the same night. then to top it off, they booked another show in yverdon on the next night, which is even closer than martigny. i'm planning to go to that one.        
Thank you so much for your post!   
I am definitely going to Seu Jorge's concert! 
Is anyone from Basel joining too?!
		 
			
			Moorcheeba with Skye (26th) in Zurich  
Sounds great, anyone going?
		 
			
			The Black Keys will be performing @ Rote Fabrik next March. 
Should be good!
		 
			
			Do we list club nights here or elsewhere?   
Anyway . . . looks like there's a good thing happening this weekend at Uto Kulm.  That's three legendary DJs!          Cheers for that, to confirm 24th March CHF35....Linky    
Sweet    
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned   as a gig guide/general stuff to do resource...just happened to see a copy of it on the tram this morning and it's a pretty comprehensive       Indeed.  I'm not sure if it's entirely comprehensive though.   
The @zueritipp Twitter feed is laughable.
		 
			
			ooooooH!!!! 
Coming back from the Cirque tonight I saw a poster for    for 25CHF next Thursday the 28th of October! 
I just checked online and there are still tickets.

			Went there for the first time last night to see Caribou and Shy Child - what a fantastic dive it is ! I miss the toilet venues in London (Dublin Castle, Windmill, Notting Hill Arts Club and so on) and this place would not look out of place if it was in a side street off Oxford Street.   
Recommended if you like down and dirty venues and interesting up and coming bands.   
Shy Child totally kicked bottom. I enjoyed Caribou but after half an hour felt I had enjoyed them sufficiently.   
Coming up - Beach House, The Swans, A Place To Bury Strangers and in January The Fall   
Pay on the door, no advance booking, no credit cards. Like stepping back to the seventies but in a GOOD way.           
Ive been hearing her songs in the local Migros a lot actually. Maybe they have her album or that she's gaining a little notoriety in Switzerland?
		 
			
			of course, in response to this....  i have to offer up the original.  I was never a massive Chisel fan, before my time, but I know every word to this one.                     Only the two in Zurich...but at the Xavier Rudd on 21st and Panteon Rococo on 24th (also in abart)

Beach House play Zurich on 16 November and the Fall play Bern on 21 November.    
Now all I need is a partner in crime!
		 
			
			Hi all, there is a gig tonight with someone called Jess who is the lead singer - i met a guy from the band on the plane today - but he didnt know where it was! anyone any clue how I can find out where it is? I'vee googled everything I can think of and cant find anything with a Jess singing. 
G

			Hey Pol, what is Komplex?             Hey Nic. Komplex is a new location (Hohlstrasse 457, Zurich - next to Letzipark). From what I've heard it is bigger than Abart and a good alternative ....
		    Strangely at the same address as Dollhouse  . Could make for some interesting shows.
		    So I look on their website and pop up a post. And then the next day I get a newsletter saying that it's not Zurich but Luzern.

			If any of youse are keen on your blues, C.W. Stoneking is playing @ El Lokal, Zurich on the 27th Feb.    
His version of seven nation army on TripleJ a few years ago was a think of beauty. Id post it but its block out of Australia    
			
			Ah, I can't believe I missed Lambchop. And Mark Lanegan, that hurts. And Einsturz. And New Model Army, they are still playing? Wowsies...I should really watch this thread.
		 
			
			Also I saw K&D are playing at Volkshaus on Jan 29th. Im super double mega pumped to see this if anyone's keen for a catch up
		    just got informed that johen arbeit will not be be playing after all      UPDATE VOM 07.01.2011: Leider musste Jochen  Arbeit die Tour aus familiären Gründen absagen.

			<3 the Cold War Kids! Thanks for the heads up on this show!      I've been living in Boston for two years now, and will be moving to Basel in a couple of months. The Dropkick Murphys put on a great show!
		 
			
			Thanks for the heads up...I saw them in Manchester many moons ago, and unfortunately they really did come off as a two/three song band. Still might be worth a watch in a small venue like the Abart.          When will you be in Basel?  If you want to meet up and have a chat or see a show drop me a line    Always nice to meet someone comming from Boston.
		    Sounds like a good show.  I will probably join.  Anyone else going?  Is this venu easy to get to from the main station?
		    Hi JustRose,       (from the Bahnhofquai/HB tramstop)  direction Albisgütli and get off at the Sihlcity Nord stop or you can catch the S4 Train (from track 1 at the Zürich HB) and get off at the Gieshubel stop. Both stops are walking distance.       Looks like the Black Keys have cancelled    
On the plus side Mogwai will play Rote Fabrik on Friday 11th March, tickets CHF35.    
			
			Some others I have seen on Zueritipp:

			Thin Lizzy are playing at Z7 in Pratteln on Thursday 3rd Feb.
		 
			
			I'm definitely going to catch the Foo Fighters at Greenfield this year. The teaser for new sound songs great (well at least the first 30 seconds). Sounds more like their older stuff.     
			
			my favourite song of the foo fighters is "" my hero"", followed by ""the pretender"" and ""wheels"". 
Looking forward to the festival........
		 
			
			I can't make it to Greenfield this year as ill be away so am planning to go to Southside festival (in southern germany) instead.  Anyone been to southside in past years?  It looks like a really great lineup this year:

		    I saw them tonight in Bexhill and they were excellent.  It was the last night of their UK tour before coming over to mainland Europe.  If there are any returned tickets I would definitely recommend it.
		 
			
			The line up for the m4music festival (24.-26.03.2011) is finally out:

		    I saw 'Does it Offend you , Yeah?' in London a couple of years ago.  Quite underwhelming though.    
I'm not a huge Streets fan, but this is a must see as it will be the final tour ever.
		    I'll be there! Anyone else?

			Ever since we moved to basel in October we have been on the hunt for local unsigned indie bands in cool small venues.  So far we have been to 2 gigs - both great but we are used to 2 or 3 a week!!!  Seems the venues are here but not always our genre of music (too heavy or hip-hop etc..)  so after waiting patiently - we have 2 gigs next weekend!! And all Swiss bands!!   
Friday the 25th at Kuppel for the Choo Choo's of Bern and the Kapoolas from Basel   
Saturday the 26th for Basel's own: Shelia She Loves You and the Oh' No's (two of the bands we've already seen) at the Union Kultur Club.   
Along with seeing the Charivari on Monday night (to see the Top Secret Drummers) its gonna be a good week!!!!
		 
			
			^ Sheila She Loves You are fab - their last gig at la Catrina in ZH last year was my fave gig of the whole year. I hope they make it back to ZH sometime soon!
		 
			
			Queens of the Stone Age   
At Komplex 457   
on 11th May
		     YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!                Gimme....where?
		 
			
			In basel try out 
Nordstern 
Hirshnek 
NT areal
		    Cheers for the heads up. Just bagged me some tickets      The one venue we really liked was Sommer Casino - they do a lot of rock, metal as well as hip/hop.  Only a couple indie nights over the last few months.  Also look at the Kaserne - this is right near us and looks fab from the outside but nothing on their calendar really appeals to us.
		    I have to yet find heavy and actually interesting here, but it is not like I venture out much for this, we live in a tiny place...so gota give it real chance. The stuff I have heard was either to eager to be heavy, leaving everything else behind, or noise for the sake of noise, but I am sure there is something worth listening.
		 
			
			queens of the stone age will also be at this year's kilby at bad bonn!!!! can't wait to find out the rest of the lineup!           Just some info on tix: tickets go on sale this  , limited to 4 per person, from either        
or        
Tix are expected to sell out fast, so get in quick!
		 
			
			After lots of wondering why there had been no news, I was sad to hear today that there will be no Zurich Open Air Festival this year   - last year's line-up was so awesome.   
BUT   
it is confirmed for 2012. Yay!       
			
			Bad Kilbi Bonn's a great festival, great atmosphere and generally good bands there. I saw the legendary Sunn o))) there a couple of years ago.
		     :d
		    And they are now sold out.
		 
			
			The Sadies @ El Lokal May 29 ... Also playing the Stolze Open Air Festival Zurich on May 28th     
cheers, 
Sue
		    ahem      
Anyway. She was fantastic.   
It was my first time at Komplex. And it's tiny. I was expecting somewhere a bit bigger than abart but I think it's actually smaller. Although it does have a higher ceiling which helps with the sound.
		    Smaller than Abart?!  Mmkay, explains why QOTSA sold out so quickly.
		    I'm sad that I missed her      
The Komplex venue can be rearranged for bigger shows. The walls are all moveable - actually it's a huge space. That's why it can accommodate bigger acts like QOTSA, My Chemical Romance, Interpol etc etc as well as the smaller ones (Phoenix Foundation, Caitlin Rose) I think the capacity is up to 5000.
		 
			
			Looks like British Sea Power have cancelled their March European tour,  including the Abart gig on the 09.03.11.    
Not sure why....but Noble cracked a rib at the last gig. Bummer!   
Gigs will hopefuly be re-scheduled for later in 2011.
		    Yep, it is planned to be re-scheduled ... or at least that is the plan so far. Fingers crossed!       I used to love Belle and Sebastian until I saw them at Open Air last year, they were pretty lame.    
			
			Haha, got sucked in and forgot what I came on here originally to post    
Anyone else going to Roger Waters this summer? I am already looking forward to it!! I just can't wait haha    
			
			I am going! can't wait       I bought The Boy With The Arab Strap when it first came out on vinyl but never really got into it. Then late last year I bought the latest and love it. Since then I have bought all of the CD's so I hope I'm not disappointed but I think they will be better indoors than out. And it should have a totally different vibe to a festival.

José is a world renowned guitarist, born in Brazil but living in Nyon. He used to teach at the Geneva conservatoire, and has appeared many times at The Paleo and Montreux Jazz festivals. A brilliant artist.
		    When you think they started as a college project, they've come far from the days of playing King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow.   
I've seen them a few times and they always deliver, but can get a little twee. At one show at the Rote Fabrik they covered Dire Straits' Romeo and Juliet. Hmm. Since Isobel Campbell left, so did the darker elements. Still worth seeing though

			Noise fans,  is playing tomorrow (sun March 6th, 9pm), in Geneva, at  .    
I was curious myself, saw this performer from New Zeland 3 days ago in Prague and he blew my mind. Plus, he is a really cool dude, high school prof on his sabatical touring the world with his musical mission. He is quite big in his field, so far on this tour he has played in UK, Scandinavia, CZ, FR, after CH he is going to Japan. Just a note for the gentle souls amongst us, bring ear plugs (just in case the sound guy sucks  ).    
It's short and sweet, very intense and a ton of dizzy fun. We are going.
		     
Wow...just checked out the Gurtenfestival...many bands I like!

		    Actually, it was awesome....The Geneva performance better than in Prague, then, Cave 12 threw a gig yesterday -  and  also quite obscure noise, I am sorry I have missed those 2.    
But, were very lucky to have Campbell Kneale of  on our couch past few days, weeheee...a lot of interesting talk.    
Check out Cave12 in Geneva, it's a fantastic project, loads of gigs are in  , an experimental culture place, I think it used to be a squat, unsurprisingly. I love the venue, nice people, guests and staff. Cave12 are great, too. Very approachable, I want to gig with them, when we finally put sh...t together.

			Another reminder for my mates awesome Rock'nRoll April events at Sedel, Luzern, stoner/pysch/desert/doom rock.   Different concerts on the 3rd, 8th, 21st(22nd is a holiday btw, so you can stay out late) and the 23rd of April, see   for details.       
Sedel is a great venue for these bands, I just wish it was a little closer to town.  Shuttle busses do run every half hour I think and only cost a tip for the driver.
		 
			
			Also, just seen   and   are playing Stall 6 in Zurich on the 2nd of April.  Loving whatever that scene is, electronic hip hop beats, monster bass and synths.  Their albums are well worth a listen if you don't mind a bit of the electronic).   
Edit : FFS, Young Gods play Sedel on the same night, and it's a friends birthday, damn.
		 
			
			The line-up for the Palèo Festival has just been announced - The National, PJ Harvey, Portishead, Beirut, The Strokes, Anna Calvi, The Chemical Brothers and more...               
			
			Filter at Abart on 22 June       there are some fine acts playing there but mainly during the week and I've got to work!    
			
			Best thing about Paleo, for me, has always been the discovery of acts I would've never seen otherwise...  &   come to mind in recent memory
		 
			
			Don't forget! Belle and Sebastian @ X-Tra ZH next Wednesday 13.04.11 Perfect indie pop - herbaceous borders, foxes, cups of tea etc etc            
Filter are phenomenal live, I saw them at a festival when Richard Patrick got nailed in the head with waterbottle. Didn't miss a beat right at the corus of 'Hey Man Nice Shot'.   
Crowd went berzerk! Sick mosh pit. I never knew 'Take a Picture' could be such a heavy song.   
Gonna hit up this show up for sure.
		 
			
			José González & The Göteborg String Theory are playing tomorrow (Friday 8th April) at Salzhaus Winterthur.       
Anyone else going as well?
		   Ben Howard is playing at the Caribana Festival in Crans-près-Céligny on 11th June:           Has anyone been to this small Festival?   
			
			Just got an e-mail with the BlueBalls Luzern lineups;   
Sophie Hunger - 22 Jul - KKL Konzertsaal 
Macy Gray - 22 Jul - KKL Luzerner Saal 
Cocoon - 23 Jul - KKL Konzertsaal 
CocoRosie - 24 Jul - KKL Konzertsaal

Agnes Obel - 29 Jul - KKL Konzertsaal 
Kelis / Jamie Lidell - 30 Jul - KKL Luzerner Saal 
Justin Nozuka / Yodelice - 30 Jul - KKL Konzertsaal   
Could be up for Sophie Hunger, CocoRosie and Joanna Newsom out of those but the rest seems a far cry from Imelda May and the Dandy Warhols last year...
		 
			
			Can anyone recommend a gig for tomorrow (Saturday) night in Zurich?   
I feel like some music        
Concert is tonight. Should be really good       
			
			Dirty Dozen Brass Band from New Orleans plays at Moods tomorrow.  I'll be there.
		 
			
			Tuesday July 5th    - X-tra     
			
			I heard that next thursday Beardyman is playing @ Stall6 for around 20CHF. If you get the chance check out his essential mix from this year (or last..... can't remember...). Basically beat-box's the entire thing while looping over himself beat-boxing.    
Its like the musical form of Inception
		 
			
			Slash plays JUL 13th at the KOmplex 
Rise Against plays Aug 23rd at the xtra 
Josh Groban plays at the KKL Luzern Oct 06 th
		   , Luzern, doors open at 22:00 tonight. 4 bands, no work tomorrow.   
The Atomic Bitchwax, Quest for Fire, NAAM and Mirror Queen.   
website for Sedel is  , it annoyingly resizes your browser though.
		 
			
			Has anyone been to Festi'neuch? I was looking at the lineup and it looks pretty good. Bonaparte, BB Brunes, The Do to name a few
		 
			
			Architecture in Helsinki playing Kaserne in Basel on Easter Sunday night. 
Australian experimental goodness.
		    Hadn't heard about this. Quite like this band so might have to pop down. 
Cheers for the heads up. If anyone else is heading along, give me a shout.
		 
			
			Owen Pallett's playing in Fribourg this evening.
		    This looks quite interesting indeed, thanks for that.   
Here's the link to the site:

			The Books are playing in St. Gallen on Friday evening. If anyone else is heading along, gimme a shout.       
			
			Sonisphere 2011 / 23 - 24 June, 2011 / Basel St. Jakob       
Line Up Thursday:               
Line Up Friday:                                                             
Already have my tickets for friday.             How was it? I wanted to go but didn't want to put up with the pain of getting back to Zürich - I had things to do on Saturday.
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this before but Raul Midon will be playing in Zurich at Moods on 10th May. Tickets available   priced at CHF38.   
This guy is brilliant        
			
			Atari Teenage Riot are playing at Salzhaus, Winterthur, 21.05.11           
Minus a member, right?
		    Yeah there's just 3 of them on tour - Alec Empire, Nic Endo, and MC CX KiDTRONiK, I think. Carl Crack OD'd in 2001.
		 
			
			Sheffield band   are playing @ Stall 6, ZH next Wednesday 18.05.11         (ps. I've got some free tix if anyone wants them, check the 'Free Stuff' section)   
			
			Holy Sh!t!   
Wilco are coming to Basel on 7th November - playing the Kaserne   
Also the Wild Beasts are playing on the river in Basel on 11th August.   
Awesome!!!
		 
			
			Cat's Eyes (Faris Badwan of The Horrors, and Canadian opera singer Rachel Zeffira) are playing at Hafenkneipe, ZH, on Thursday 26.05.11, kind of dark girl group pop with goth undertones. Watch their debut performance at the Vatican (of all places!):       
			
			anyone else going to einstürzende neubauten tomorrow and on thursday in lausanne? i'm SO looking forward to it! if i manage to get there in time that is...   
			
			A while away yet, but awesome Kiwi band   are playing at Abart, ZH, Thurs. 08 September 2011. I saw them at the m4m festival this year and they almost blew the roof off Exil.
		 
			
			Cut Copy + Architecture in Helsinki @ Stall 6, ZH, 28.06.11 - so I will get to see AiH this year after all    
			
			Grandmaster Flash at Stall 6, Zürich, Saturday May 28, 22.00
		    Getting back home was the expected long, drawn-out, sleepy saga, but it was worth it. Cinema-gig with the band sitting on stage in front of the screen, ripping into their instruments, while videos played behind, it was pretty unique. The band hung around before and after and had beers with the masses too, nice blokes.
		 
			
			DJ Shadow at Komplex Zurich on 04.06   
and Arcade Fire at Montreux Jazz Festival on 10th July!!          I try and go every year, will be there all 4 days this time. If you like old school 90s hip hop they usually have a big name one evening or another. The rest is either French Pop / Reggae (so many hippies in NE) / usually decent electro and some kids singer on the Sunday afternoon which is when the families are there.    
  It was really crowded last year, I hope it'll be better organised (more bars, less VIP space) so getting drinks doesn't take half an hour. There's load of benches and what not so sit down on and it's by the lakeside so you can smoke by the rocks if you want. Thing of it as a Fete Des Vendanges you have to pay an entrance to and that has decent music. Well worth it... so long as it doesn't rain too much, but most of the place is covered by tents anyway.
		 
			
			Too bad I am not here!  
The  in Winterthur (15 min by train from Zürich!) is on in June, they have concerts from June 10-12th.               
ENJOY         playing Zürich 30th June
		 
			
			Anyone wanna join me in the Rote Fabrik to see Slim Cessna's Auto Club. Some band members from 16 Horsepower, in the theme of American folkrock, kinda.       
			
			Simian Mobile Disco playing Nordstern in Basel on Friday night and Cut Copy playing Hinterhof on 29th. Really looking forward to both.
		 
			
			CEREMONY is playing on the 28th of july in Dynamo in Zürich:       
Together with: 
LA DISPUTE 
TOUCHE AMORE 
DEATH IS NOT GLAMOROUS
		 
			
			...and still far ahead, but KVELERTAK is playing in the Abart in Zürich on the 1st of december:       
Together with:   
TOXIC HOLOCAUST 
TRAP THEM 
WOLVES LIKE US
		 
			
			Destroyer is playing Rote Fabrik on the 24th of June. His last album out-80s the 80s, and if the live show is anywhere near as batshit-bizarre as this video, it should be interesting.       
			
			Lenny Kravitz  at the Hallenstadion Nov.26 th  
Flogging Molly at the Komplex 457 Nov.17 th 
The Kooks at Komplex 457 Oct.26 th
		 
			
			the Cat Empire are playing at Komplex on the 12th November (tix on sale on the 29th June)
		    Yes - did I miss it?     
Can't believe I've only just found this thread    
			
			Just got back from seeing Filter at Abart. It was AWESOME! It's quite surreal seeing bands that I grew up listening to.  Back in the Republic of South Africa, it's a dream come true to see bands like this.  I'm very grateful to be able to have these experiences and see these band that I admire and really love.
		 
			
			Sebadoh at Abart in Zürich on August the 15th. Grungey!       
			
			Just happened to notice Fleet Foxes are playing at Komplex 457 on 21.11...some way off yet I know! As much as I like their albums I'm not sure about seeing them live - anyone seen them before?
		 
			
			^ I haven't seen Fleet Foxes before, but I'll be there.   
also, awesome aussies cloud control are playing at hafenkneipe 19.09.11. great band, lovely people.
		    Not quite my thing but very good live, I've heard.
		 
			
			Switzerland has its fair share of good gigs!!!      always has a good line up.   
And the Red Hot Chili Peppers are playing in Zurich before they even come to the UK!!!! Dec 13th at Hallenstadion!
		 
			
			The Dub Pistols are playing in Fribourg tomorrow night, 2nd July, as part of Fribourg Jazz Parade. Don't really know much about them, but sound right up my street.          Generally regarded as having given a very weak performance at Glasto last weekend.
		 
			
			Manic Street Preachers are playing at the Winterthurer Musikfestwochen on Sunday 28.08.11:          @ Plaza, ZH, 01.11.11. Tickets  .
		 
			
			11.10.2011 - Beady Eye @ Volkshaus, Zurich 
Tickets are going on sale tomorrow ( )
		 
			
			Not Zürich but definately worth the trip - The Antlers play St. Gallen 3rd December.
		 
			
			Some bands work much better in a venue then at a festival. Actually most bands do.       
			
			Hi we're just moving down from Lux in Sept and in the past few weeks have seen Foals, PJ Harvey - Prince played here etc etc. There is a good music scene here and it's advertised of 2 main websites, is that the case in Zurich or Switz as a rule? 
Thanks
		    Arse - back in the UK then. The last album was a corker .... back to the old form
		    Sunday August 14 - Zofingen - Heitere Open Air Festival
		    It's ok. There's a lot of bands that don't come. As Far as I'm aware PJ and Foals have never been.
		    PJ plays Paleo I believe, this weekend. And I'll miss her       Tickets available on ricardo if you want them.    
I'm just going to pretend that I meant Zürich.
		    Nope ... Foals played at Abart last year. Zurich is not that bad after all       I didn't say i was bad, just ok! I'll revise my opinion when Radiohead come and play on their next tour.
		    damn, only one Swiss date??    
Will you be seeing them on the UK leg of their tour DP?
		    I am going to see them in Hastings.  Just a few minutes walk from my house

			Zurich: Wednesday 17th August   
PRINCE!!       
There are no more standing tickets left from ^ that ticket link, but I found mine from a UK website
		 
			
			The concert from prince in cologne arena was absolut rubbish, he played 
one song, left the stage for 50 mins, returned for anonther 65 mins and left 
early after a total of 75 mins played, some people payed about 150 euros for a seat.         That's a shame. He's usually one of the best live acts out there (imo) 
I hope he'll not be doing the same in Zurich
		 
			
			Friendly Fires will definitely be worth a look....   
Sadly I won't be able to make it - but I recommend   (Abart, 8th Sept)
		 
			
			City and Colour @ Exil in Zürich, 01.10.2011 19:30, CHF 28.-

			Great baltimore duo Wye oak are playing at Fri-Son, Fribourg 10.11.11 (sadly no ZH show   )              they're playing geneva too on the 7th. thanks for the heads up.
		     
Saw them a couple of years ago at that very spot.  Was very, very loud, we got very drunk, one mate got into a fight in the mosh pit and was almost thrown out, another ended up sleeping under a mattress in a squat somewhere in Zurich.
		 
			
			I'd like to recommend the songkick.com website, it's brilliant. 
It scans your iTunes library or you can quickly and easily choose the interests that interest you as well as the cities and you have a personalized calendar and receive emails when concerts of interest are announced.
		 
			
			Brilliant !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		     
This is spam but the songkick iOS app is pretty good.
		                i'll be there! in lausanne as well!  )

 Tickets went on sale this morning...I got mine at starticket      
V excited...though I might get over that by January       I've heard the Spice Girls are reforming, maybe that's more to your tastes?
		    Oh and you sadly missed Biebef by a couple of weeks, I'm afraid.
		 
			
			Man Man   in Lausanne Tuesday. Gutted to miss this--they are supposed to be a fantastic live show.

			Danish band  are playing at Stall 6 on Wednesday 28.09.11:         I've got some free tix if anyone wants them: http://wp.me/pLHpb-1fr   
			
			Not so much a Heads-up, more of an ""Oh Bollocks"", but did anyone catch the Buzzcocks in Aarau last Saturday? Any good? I missed it as I was in the UK.        Saw them last year when the played Zug OpenAir (free festival) it was nice to say I'd seen them but tbh they were nothing special at all.

		    NOOOOooooooooo!!!
		 
			
			For all you Vaud jazzers,   is coming to Chorus, Lausanne, 15 October 201, with his Migration band.  This is a musician/drummer not to be missed if you can make the gig.  Reservations will be necessary, I am sure.   
Antonio has many projects, but those of you in the know will recognize him as Pat Metheny's drummer in his PMG (Pat Metheny Group), the drummer since 2003.       
This is a big musician coming to Lausanne.
		    with Toxic Holocaust, The Secret and Wolves Like Us

I'll be going there from Basel, so it would be great to have some company on the train there (and back).
		    Too bad Trap Them was cancelled for this show   They now got replaced by The Secret
		 
			
			Blue October are coming to Z-7 in Pratteln BL on 19 November.  I saw them once in Boston and it was a good show.  Too bad i am not in Basel then to see them again. 
BLUE OCTOBERSamstag, 19.11.2011   
BLUE OCTOBER 
+ Special Guest   
BLUE OCTOBER - Golden Ticket (64.50 CHF)

			Brit Bobby Long is playing on October 16 at Laborbar in Zurich at 20:00.  It will be a great show by a super talented artist!  If anyone's interested in going, let me know!   is his website if you want to check out his music....
		 
			
			Perhaps this could be interesting for some people: the people from the Kilbi festival in Düdingen/Bad Bonn will launch something like a   in winter - 9th/10th December in Exil (and Moods) Zurich.   
Particularly looking forward to Glenn Branca Ensemble and Thurston Moore. It's a little pricey (85.- for both days), though it's worth it for me.
		    presents  .   
The concert will be held on  at  , at   in Burgweg 7, 4058 Basel.   
You can buy tickets for 24 CHF through  ,  , at SBB and Post. Or you can buy it at the venue for 26 CHF from 21h on the night of the gig.   
The concert itself starts at 22h, but there will be a party at around midnight with DJ Edin and DJ Bob Rock playing Balkan/electro music.   
Kultur Shock plays some sort of Balkan music/rock/metal/punk fusion, and they are particularly good live. Well see for yourselves:       
and the same track live at exitfest 2010 in Novi Sad, Serbia:       
Great huh?! }:-) 
See you there!
		 
			
			Don't forget: British Sea Power are playing at the Abart, ZH this Wednesday 12.10.11. They had to cancel their ZH show twice before, so fingers crossed they'll make it this time!           
			
			pretty much my reaction too, with an few choice expletives thrown in though. I did regain my composure long enough to selflessly post it here, thinking it might help some deserving music fan out that way catch them.          Good concert, though I was pretty drunk. Place seemed to empty by the end of the gig, shame really, but as their last album was their worst so far then I'm not surprised.
		 
			
			Just got my Tickets for   at Stall 6, 6th November.   
For techno heads, Richie Hawtin is playing as  , Komplex 457, 22nd October.   
Probably also going to see   on 21st November.
		   Machine Head 
Devil Driver 
Darkest Hour 
Bring Me The Horizon   
Nov. 21st 2011, Volkshaus Zürich, 7.30pm        Tits. Just realised I'm away when this is on.
		 
			
			Saharan blues from Tinariwen at Kaufleuten in Zurich on Saturday 15th October. If you've not heard them live and like riddim then it's the concert for you. A major influence on so many records recently.   
I happen to have two tickets for this show for sale at cost price  .       
			
			Has it sold out? I was considering it but won't decide until Saturday. I'll post again on sat just in case you haven't sold them.
		 
			
			Glasgow-based band   are playing at Papiersaal, ZH, on Wednesday 19.10.11. I'm liking them a lot lately, and I reckon they'll be great:         (I've also got some free tix if anyone wants them: http://wp.me/pLHpb-1i4)   
			
			The Italian electro-rock band   is visiting Basel.   
The gig is starting at 21h on 30th of October in Grenzwert bar (Rheingasse 3, in Kleinbasel).      to their profile with more of their work.   
And a small glimpse on what you might expecting a few weeks:     
So if you feel like changing your Swiss routine, you can start by going out on Sunday evenings as well. }:-)   
See you there!
		 
			
			Not my kind of music - normally, but they have some catchy pop songs which put you in a good mood. Swiss - German music   - in English.    
20.10. BOY playing at Alte Börse (new venue)

		    We rarely read reviews after the event on this thread, so I'll keep it brief: It was very good   Support act François & The Atlas Mountains had some interesting beats but strange, Eno-esque dance moves, which were a bit theatrical, but in all very West Coast French dance melancholia. Anna Calvi's voice is a joy to hear. Nuff said.   
Oh Hai GastroGnome! I tried to grab ya but you had more beauties surrounding you than I did, so I didn't want to steal your thunder       I was there too! I'll be writing a review soon (on my blog, though, will post a link), just haven't had a moment. We should do a meet up at the next suitable gig, what do you think?

			A bumper week for music in ZH next week! Obviously getting to all of them may involve some kind of cloning technology   but here are my tips:       
			
			I'd love to say The Kills were great last night, but due to the   sound at X-tra, it's hard to say.    
Not the first time either - I'm not going to waste my hard earned on that venue anymore.
		     Were you upstairs or downstairs?   
I find if you are right in the middle upstairs the sound is not so bad.

			Sisters of mercy (chf 55) and its at xtra in zurich. Date 23rd November 2011   
I've got a spare ticket for the above   
If you're interested please pm me
		 
			
			looking forward for the sisters of mercy tomorrow and on thursday! can't believe i have never seen them before!    
next days' schedule:     
tomorrow: work, drive to zürich, gig, drive back 
thursday: train to lausanne, work, gig, sleep 
friday: drive back, work 
saturday: drive to zürich, vive la fete gig 
sunday: drive back, probably spend day on sofa 
monday: work, drive to zürich, fakir's gig, drive back ?   
why do all the bands chose to play at the same time and almost never in bern??
		    I was bang in the middle, about a foot behind the sound desk. Logically I would have thought the best place for sound in the venue...       yes,that is normally the best spot  . Try upstairs next time if you can.
		    price negotiable, if anyone is interested
		    mhm, the last time when there was paul kalkbrenner, sound was fine?!  
same with belle & sebastian and morcheeba.
		 
			
			sisters of mercy gig at the xtra was pretty good but the sound quality was terrible, more due to xtra than the sisters. not the first time a gig has been ruined for me at the xtra due to useless sound quality
		 
			
			Right, don0t know what the problem there is. The second half of the gig was much better.          Skindred are an awesome band - saw them at Download a couple of years back.  DK Murphies are a must see too - saw them in boston last year.
		 
			
			anyone going to any of these?   
the horrors - tomorrow night 
smashing pumpkins - next fri 2nd dec 
dEUS - next sat 3rd dec 
thurston moore - sat after 10th dec   
im new to town (zurich) but will be headinbg to these gigs, so feel free to say hi!   
(especially if you know where i can buy vimto...)
		 
			
			I'll be at the Horrors tonight, gimme a shout if you want to meet up. I know of a few Asian stores in Oerlikon which sell Vimeo that I can give you directions for ^^
		 
			
			sounds good       i'll most probably be at the dEUS one! and also at dEUS in neuchatel on the 6th     
thurston moore, i thought i was going but it's on the same date as FAQ's gig in Aarau   
and i think i'm probably going there, as the partying will surely be better!    
i had some friends seeing smashing pumpkins in london a few weeks ago and they were very disappointed (and they are pretty big fans). so i'm not going (to be fair, i wouldn't go anyway as i'm not crazy about them)   
we seem to like similar music, so feel free to come and say hi tomorrow at Fakir's show in kaffi für dich (details a few posts above).
		 
			
			Hi Crimson, I'll see I will see about monday night, tho i tend to work late at the moment. I'll def be at dEUS tho, my fav band! That should be ace. it woul dbe good to go to the show on the 6th as well but, work!   
Shame to hear your friends didnt like the pumpkins recently, i had friends at copenhagen, manchester and london gigs and they were nothing but loving the shows. they are the band that usually suprise me most at shows with how amazing they are, but i shall see!
		 
			
			i hope you will enjoy the sp show! let us know!    
dEUS are perfect. every time i see them i can't get over how great they are. and they are not even my favourite band! (but amongst the top ones anyway)

The Musical Box is a highly professional canadian Genesis tribute band. They bring the early Genesis years - when Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett were still in the band - back to life. They recreate their vintage shows as original as possible. The sounds, the sights, the costumes, the lights, the everything. They are very approved by the original band. Phil Collins even played a show or two with them. This time they will play the ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"" show in its entirety. It's rumoured that original Genesis guitarist   will join them for the encores!

That's the original price. I will not charge any postal delivery costs but require payment in advance, preferably paypal. I would send them out immediately after having received the money.

while I had my head in the books studying for exams I forgot to do something very important (buy Noel Gallagher tickets at Komplex 457). Now they have sold out and I am kicking myself(!).

hoo.   
CHF300.- gone. just. like. that.                  I've got tickets for wilco, earth, bruce springsteen and mastodon. I am thinking of seeing the tindersticks (brilliant in geneva in 2010, good in zurich in 2011) and lambchop. I saw lambchop a few years ago in the rote fabrik and they were dreadful, the band was sloppy, the crowd got bored and people started to go home. they must have had a fight because there was lots of banter between them which didn't involve the audience. this was promoting the damaged album.
		    I was at that gig: it was US Independence Day. Talking backstage with them during the interval Kurt and MacManus were talking about being TourBlind: it was getting tired and no longer personal. They wanted to be with their families, especially on that night. After a peace pipe, they came back on and played some haunting stuff, which many didn't enjoy, as you note. The banter was down to, er, the pipe, me thinks.   
Crap jokes were still crap, though. Can't wait to see them again.

		    Thanks for this old advice Jimmy Bee! I did not make the concert last year but went tonight to see him at Moods, he was playing with his Primitive Horn Orchestra...       Yes, brilliant music. But their concerts should be black and white.
		    Haha! So true....      - are you sure you are ""working"" out of the country for three months? Pretty sure me and Prof T saw you playing the drums last night in the Primitive Orchestra!

For anyone who hasn't heard this Canadian gem, they are highly acclaimed and having seen them in concert back in Manitoba, they are amazing live.           Hello and welcome to the Forum. You can post concert events on the mysteriously invisible*   or under   ( if you're a promoter or financially involved).   
Putting a concert / event on the calendar gives it greater exposure and allows for some 'buzz' (is this what the kids call it these days?).   
Also, you can set up a  . This particular thread can be hard work to get overview, so lead from the front!

			here's a great video with all the wikipedia 'updates' on Nickelback over the years.     
Some are very informative and amusing            
I guess I'll be dancing alone then           Canada has enough awesome music.    
Nickelback is just the Canadian reaction to Creed.

			Looking forward to RPWL at the Galery Music Bar in Pratteln this evening:       
Although the Z-7 crew are promoting and selling tickets, the venue is the Galery just down the road, not the Z-7 black hall.   
RPWL started life as a Pink Floyd covers band, but they've had their own progressive style for more than a decade now, their latest CD ""Beyond Man and Time"" is very good melodic rock.
		    I'd go just to see Janelle Monae. She's amazing
		    I like the line-up but can't understand why it's called Montreux ""Jazz"". Been to Cully last weekend, much jazzier there and a fantastic atmosphere.
		 
			
			Would love to see Tony Bennett but tickets are very expensive
		    I guess it's kind of hard to change the name midride.... and much of nowadays music is influenced by jazz (the good stuff at least)
		 
			
			Eagles of Death Metal are playing in Solothurn on the 21st of June.

Saw him a few years ago at the wonderful bastion of downtown bohemia El Lokal, but almost fell asleep. He has a massive following but somehow he's lost his bite.    
Chicks dig him though, so see you there.
		    Definitely a victim of his own prolificacy.   
He is my beard mentor though, I'll be heading along for some ad hoc trimming tips.
		    MOLOTOV will also play in Winterthur, Salzhaus,

Tickets are on sale at   for a WHOPPING 78,60 plus the print at home fee makes it an 80 CHF ticket... I don't get why they charge us to print out the ticket at home.. that should be free right?   
			
			Quite a treat: starting on Friday, 16th November at the Reitschule in Bern is the   festival, celebrating 15 years of Constellation Records. Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Do Make Say Think, and A Silver Mt. Zion, amongst others.       Godspeed also in Zürich's Rote Fabrik for 35chf

			The Tindersticks ( ) and the Maccabees ( ) are playing in Fri-Son in November. Don't realy know a great deal about either band, but will have a butchers at YouTube and might pop along to one or the other.   
Edit: Sorry, had wrong dates.
		          The Tindersticks are a brilliant band, check out their second album with this cover (   and Curtains:   
The music is melancholic, moody, orchestral   
They can be brilliant live especially when they have their string and horn sections in tow.   
I fully recommmend them and good luck!
		    Thanks for the heads-up on this @Crumbs.  Can't wait!    
			
			What is it with the XTRA venue in Zürich?The sound quality is truly dreadful. I have seen several live bands there and I have always noticed the poor sound quality. Only the supremely organized or very loud acts seem to be able to overcome the poor sound quality of this venue.
		 
			
			Thanks PaddyG, I've been wanting to see the Maccabees for years :-). Seen Tindersticks, not really my bag.       
			
			I'll be going to:

			I've got tickets for Fleetwood Mac on 13-10-2013 at the (wretched) Hallenstadion in Zurich and I'm really excited about seeing Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie and the two lucky guys
		    There have been rumours about (no pun intended  ) that Christine McVie may also appear on the tour
		    I'm glad to hear it but I thought she'd retired completely, she really has to sing her songs, Stevie Nicks has too country a voice to sing Christine's songs imho. I'm also really looking forward to seeing Buckingham, a seriously underrated guitarist, play

I'm finally going to get to see one of my favourite bands!    
			
			Nouvelle Vague play Kaserne in Basel on 2nd October. I have my tickets :-)           
btw what did you think of the gig? I wasn't impressed, I saw her last year in Geneva and she way way better
		    strange, i was also last year in geneva and did not enjoy it very much. i thought she was in a bad mood, whereas in zürich she was in a good mood   
i really liked the one in zürich and the one in montreux a couple of weeks later. still have the songs in my head. gotta love her.
		    i'm going as well! and to another place they're playing, could it be geneva? (yes too lazy to check)    
i've seen them live a few times already and i'm always impressed by the energy they bring on stage. much better than the cds in my opinion. you will love it!
		    Oh! I thought I might be the only one from here that would be interested. Maybe with the exception of Prof T.   
I saw Red Sky Coven a few years ago, but haven't managed NMA yet. Really looking forward to it.
		    exciting, isn't it?   see you there!    
			
			Fat Freddy's Drop, in Zurich 21st October       
will buy tix soon
		    god they were incredibily shit live 3 years ago at the kaufleuten. they sound like a local schoolband doing covers, far from their fab CD productions.

			I'm hoping for a fun night out rather musical masterpieces.        
			
			For country fans, Band Perry will be in concert in Zurich at   on the 23rd of November.  Warm-up acts (not listed here) are:  Easton Corbin and a a dynamite guitar player from Canada, Lindsay Ell (her mentor was Randy Bachman of BTO).
		 
			
			I don't get the nouvelle vague love, for me its money for old rope.
		    well, some versions have a bit of fresh new paint to it or sound interesting though i am not a big fan. just got a ticket from a friend, so i just 'been there'. what i like about them is the nice singing voice of the girl that wasnt there at kaufleuten and therefor (sorry, lou) were rather like a fly buzzing around my head...
		 
			
			vive la fete are playing in bern this coming saturday. woop!        
			
			Hi guys, been lucky enough to follow some of the greatest bands around just before they ""made it"" (luck and friends, not me). Went to see this Swiss band absolutely amazing and a brilliant punctuation to my move to Sydney. I think Domi should be big and I mean BIG       This got good around the five minute mark.  Sounds like what would happen if you put Thom Yorke and the XX in the same room.
		    Really cool music but my god what a shocking voice. They really need a new singer...        You have a good point...Not everyone can be this guy:       
			
			Anyone going to see Lucero on September 18?
		    I gotta see her live one of these days, can't believe I have missed her so many times. Did she do Nude on the News?
		    nope, unfortunately! according to my catpower expert boyfriend (and kind of friend of hers) she refuses to play it
		    I can't have too much of her all the time, a bit too dramatic but Nude on the News is one of my all time favs, really. She is so spontaneous and talented. I hung with folks who went to see her a lot in Atlanta.
		    i cannot have too much of her at once as well. but i like her more and more as the years go by
		 
			
			So I went to see Nouvelle Vague on Wednesday night, the sound quality of the band was not so good but the singing was perfectly fine and the entertainment factor was excellent. Over all a great night out and a lot of fun; I would go and see them again.           maybe because her song is called Nude as the News... see! Catpower loves me more than you!    
			
			After skipping out on most of the festival scene this summer, I'm excited to see The Dirty Head and the iconic Sublime (with Rome) on Nov. 12 at Haerterei. Great show for those who enjoy the punk/ska/reggae cali scene.           
			
			Rude Zone Festival at Dynamo, Zurich, November 1st:     
with BAD MANNERS and RED SOUL COMMUNITY, ++support           
			
			Sea Sick Steve @ Komplex on the 2nd Nov. is gonna be great.

For those people who enjoy the sounds of ""The Eagles"", I highly recommend checking out High South at   on February 15th.  Festival runs for seven weeks but these guys are THE best!  Don't miss 'em!
		 
			
			Just a follow-up to previous post -   is the longest running Country Fest in the world.  It's a beautiful day today so why not cap it off at one of the best looking concert locations listening to some great music.    is the headliner tonight.

		    Bad bonn kilbi is the best featival ever! In the middle of nowhere....highly recommended! I cannot go this year (getting married that weekend) but i cannot stress enough what a cool festival it is! 
Ps: if you go make sure to walk to the nearby lake and enjoy the beauty of thr scenery
		     
oh wow The Black Angels too! AND Mac Demarco!
		 
			
			Just seen the line up for Monteux Jazz 2015 and I don't think there is any artist that particularly stands out.  Perhaps they are keeping the best for next year as it will be the 50th one       
			
			thanks for the heads up, some good acts playing like Ibeyi, Foxygen, The Staves, Portishead, Sophie Hunger, Lionel Richie, Kronos Quartet, James Blake, Sly and Robbie, Anna Calvi, Alt J, Santana, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, George Benson,  etc etc   
but some serious crap as well, there is very little quality control going on these days
		 
			
			i'd also recommend dEUS and asaf avidan
		    I missed this, I love the Sleaford Mods!   
Otherwise a weak line up. I saw Thurston Moore with Sonic Youth at BKB a few years ago and they were lame. Highlight were the mighty Sunn O)))   
@crimson, I fully agree BKB is a great festival with a great vibe
		 
			
			Thurston Moore solo, I would go see. It is different, especially if he is in the mood.    
dEus is amazing. And James Blake.    
I want to see all that       Thurston Moore has different moods? How can one tell?
		    The left corner of his lips is about 2mm above the right one?   
I know    
But I do like drony stuff that washes over. There's certain poetry in a wall of noise.    
Which reminds me, completely unrelated, I gotta wish for a uke for my bday that is coming up

			recommended gigs in the VERY NEAR future (May) for Zurich:   
16.05: Dandy Warhols, Plaza (think of White Stripes with more fun)     
27.05: Porches, Klaus (from NYC - great fun)     
28.05: Dead Meadow, Club Zukunft (superb psych/garage band)     
29.05: Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Mascotte (surely no need to introduce them?)        anyway, they are a good band - very indie, if they come round again worth the trip.
		 
			
			Ezra Furman plays in Zurich tonight at Bogen F, 21:00.
		   play in Zurich at the  , 8th February.        
			
			I love them. ""Up with People"".   
Ezra Furman and his ""My Zero"" is MiniMC's ultimately fav song.
		    Doh! its the Missus's Birthday, oh well, I will just say its a surprise       Lambchop play Geneva the night before the Zurich gig; they play Luzern the night after.    
Ezra was ok the other night but the crowd seemed more happy to be there than enjoy being there, but that's the Swiss concert experience. He seemed tired.
		    I find that infuriating, in Zürich its about being seen at a concert but with absolutely no interest in the music! I am always telling people to stfu especially during quieter songs, when it seems the gig becomes a social gathering. The amount of times I have heard performers saying something about that during a performance, I don't think the Zürich audience gets it!    
			
			sooooo true....
		 
			
			Great thread. Any hint of U2 coming back...sadly passed us by last time (from a fans point of view that is).
		    It will be better when people start caring more for content than form. Being seen may also translate as liking the music, privately, you cannot expect a discrete culture all of a sudden show authentic affection in a prestigeous environment. The fact that the musicians and loads of listeners do not consider it prestigeous (the partisan opposite) is irrelevant.    
Les Grottes are great; in GE. Anti prestigeous. Weird enough stuff.
		    Lead from the front: dancing and enjoying yourself is the perfect way to get your square metre of space and will encourage the others. I was, however, told off by a woman once at a Nicolas Jaar gig for dancing. I apologised and told her next time I wanted to have fun I'd stay at home and listen on my headphones. Some just can't abide happiness in others.
		     
Hahahah. I am used to lead from the stage   , the best kind of hedonistic leadership.    
Well - I agree with you. There are places that support actual fun. And I also think that people do not dance for the same reason other stuff doesn't get done here, worried about spontaneity/authenticity being perceived as impolite, rude.    
I dance when I feel like it. Gigs, classrooms, balet halls, tents. I think the stiffness will change. A buddy of mine went to headphones party (4 diff music channels), she had to look for somebody dancing to the same stuff. Fun. And some rooms had no light. Gasp! Puritanism is on its way out of life.

			I am living in Kanton Aargau but occasionally goes to cities like Basel, Zürich, Bern and am wondering where there are nice small cosy places with acoustic live music i.e. americana, folk-rock, country and western.   
Any recommendations (inspiration) would be helpful.   
Thanks!
		 
			
			Hi JHC   
In Zürich and Winterthur there are quite a few places that I know. It depends on the band or the night though as to the music style. Most places can be googled or found on FB for details of that and pics of venue. Some places only have a band now and then and some have an 'acoustic night' during the week. Great cosy place. Esse Bar in Winterthur just by the station. Folk and more on Sundays there sometimes has that style. Dimensione in Winterthur or Fahrenheit. Zürich Bar Münster, Cafe Henrici, piccolo giardino, Bar rossi in langstrasse -many bars in Langstrasse Zürich and niederdorf, The International Beer Bar.    
Other places. Bar am Egge. Sometimes Damm Bar in Zürich or Jenseits im Viadukt. Lively Openmic at Mcgees opp. Bahnhof Wiedikon every two weeks on Sunday from 1930, one today.  .    
Hope that helps  
JB
		 
			
			+ El Lokal for big names in a small venue.
		 
			
			Hey!?    
Thanks a lot both of you! That's something (rather a lot) for at start.   
Had a look at them and most places looks really cool and cosy.   
It's always easy to Google places but it's only when people starts recommending them it gets really interesting.   
Thanks again! Highly appreciated.   
Jesper
		 
			
			Hi Jesper, 
you can also try out Mehrspur its in Zürich (Toni-Areal). They got a lot of concerts during the week many of them free (ranging from acoustic, folk, to jazz, gipsy jazz, pop,folk,rock and sometimes latin)and once a month they have an open mic which is also cool.   
Check out also Kafi fürDich or Cabaret Voltaire, they got acoustic concerts usually every week. 
cheers!
		    Thanks! I'll definitely check it out!   
Just saw that Kafi fürDich aren't allowed to play live music anymore

			Hello there!   
I am a ETH student, I am relatively new in Zurich and I love jazz music. I am interested in some pubs where I can listen to some good live jazz music. I have been asking around and they all tell me that Moods is very good, but quite expensive. I want something more affordable for a student. Also if someone wants to join me, that would be great, since I don't know many people here who likes jazz.    
Thanks in advance!
		 
			
			I am in love with Eryca Badu.  That is Jazz, and I am sure Zurich has that.  We just do not know where to find it.   Doooba dubbba didda du da du.
		 
			
			Wednesday nights at the  are free. Start there, maybe, as long as you don't mind a bit of so-so musak from time to time. There can be some great nights, too.   
You'll certainly meet interesting people who'll point you in the right direction. AND IT'S FREE.   
This  shows where you'll find live Jazz in Zurich and beyond. Google also helps.   
Moods is expensive but there's a great crowd so worth it IMO.   
PS, as noted below by DenisK, Mehrspur is no longer free. It's CHF5.-   
Don't that make your brown eyes blue.
		 
			
			You can also feel free to check out ""Mehrspur"" at the Toni Areal. I think they have a regular live Jazz evening on Wednesday -> Entry fee 5 CHF ... and a lot of other programs / events pertaining to Jazz otherwise    
			
			Widder bar also has jazz often. No cigars indoors anymore though    
			
			Thank you very much guys, I really appreciate this info! Will definitely try those places (will find the way to bring some of my friends with me hhaha)   
Thanks!
		 
			
			Mambo Café might be of interest too.
		 
			
			Jazz bar in Seefeld:    
			
			One more I forgot about, sorry!                  
			
			Does anybody know of any clubs in Bern?
		               
here a link to links
		 
			
			Or you can search  
I am also interested in jazz concerts so if you need company, let me know!     in Thun is a great cosy place with great music too.
		 
			
			Mehrspur, I agree. As far as I remeber there is the jam session every Wed evening, entrance for free. It is now located at the Toni Areal, once it was close to the Bellevue...
		 
			
			never been there personally but i've been told Falcone sounds holds a jam session every thursday evening at 9, where they also play Jazz. its free, of course.
		 
			
			The LION Pub by Rennweg has Jazz every second Saturday, however with the football starting, the will eventually switch to Sunday Lunch Jazz.  The Last Sat Night Jazz is on the 4th of June from 1800.  Free Entry, food and alcohol are also reasonably priced..
		 
			
			The Jazz Jam session in Mehrspur is on Tuesday's now and it's free.

with Flavio andhis violin, it is even more magical ...
		 
			
			Oh what a shame it's on a weekday and in the evening  . OH and I would have gladly joined you guys had it been at a different time.     
Peut-etre a la prochaine fois!
		 
			
			Yes, such a shame it has to be on a Tuesday evening- not ideal. But they are coming between major concerts in Milan, Cinque Terre, Budapest and Amsterdam - we are lucky to have them come at all.
		 
			
			Got permission from the Commune to have the concert at the local Church nearby in case of rain - let's hope we can all sit in the field but that is a great alternative just in case.
		 
			
			Such a bloody shame it's on a weekday    
Enjoy!
		 
			
			We will be at Le Creux-du-Van and Le Soliat farm on Monday evening (10th - join us for a fondue) - or La Maison de l'Absinthe Museum in Môtiers on Tuesday morning from 10 till 12.00 - in case that is easier for you.
		 
			
			Such a shame none of you could come- as it was truly magical. Musicians came from all over Switzerland and France (2 from Marseilles!) - at 3am, after a fabulous concert, we had about 12 musicians jamming- and 7 stayed over and just left - very very special. 
There are some magical days and people that do literally change your lives.   
My HANG is on order and will be getting it when we next go to the UK a bit later this year. Wow.   
If you go on the Facebook page of 
Maison de l'Absinthe 
you'll see a short video of the 3 in action
		    I'm really annoyed that I couldn't show up    
It  would be wonderful if they'd do this again on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday.    
Well, at least you enjoyed it.    
			
			Well we were gob smacked at the number of people who started arriving from such a long way away ... lots of families with children too... on a Tuesday night. They certainly covered their expenses too, which was great for them.
		     
wow.
		 
			
			As many expressed interest last year about Daniel's Hang concert- he will be at Kiosk Art at Neuchâtel Jeunes Rives bar- this Sunday 14th at 18.00. After a long tour of Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, Vienna and more ... with Thalavataam, a fabulous Indian percussionist.   
Hope some of you can make it - we just can't wait.     a weekend too early, not yet back to CH. do you know if they are heading anywhere else in vicinity before returning his gran's car   
			
			What a shame Tasebo. Others expressed an interest when we had the concert here last year- so thought I'd post just in case some can come.   
We will have a rock concert here on 28th of August at 14.00 - with my student, friend and neighbour and his group from Geneva Down to the Bunker ...   
PM for detail - bring a blanket to sit on, food for the barbie and a salad, your drinks - kids welcome (but with earplugs please DTTB are quite loud   - you can u-tube or FB them).
		 
			
			Clip from gig in Bangalore last month. Tonight they are playing in Vienna, after Festivals in Crotatia and Romania.       
			
			On their way here from Vienna- it's going to be epic- as my grandson says. Hope some of you can come along ...       
no ticket required- donations on the night + CDs for sale.
		 
			
			They arrived from Vienna at 4.15 am - just showered and breakfasted and we will be on our way to the gig in Neuch    
			
			Wahooo - it was epic and wouldn't have missed it for the world.   
Getting a bit too old for those 3.30 am late nights- but    
			
			We are so so lucky- Daniel and Montry have agreed to play again this Friday at 20.30 - at KioskArt again- Jeunes Rives by Lake Neuchâtel Wahooo.   
Daniel Waples on Hang, from London- perhaps the best in the world and Thaalavattam from Kerala India on percussion- mostly reused materials and pipes - absolutely amazing.
		     
Will you be back for Friday evening's gig? I so hope so as it was fa -bu -lous last Sunday.
		 
			
			Bump.
		 
			
			Wow- that was magical- great music, great crowd, full moon and ripples on the lake. Wonder if any of you made it? Their European tour finished in fabulous style   
			
			Daniel and Flavio will be playing again this Summer- Essing in Germany on 13th of May, and a few dates in Switzerland to be announced later. 
Wonderful news.       
click on the blue or yellow CD to hear them together- magical.

			I want to go out with my girlfriend tonight and watch some live music but it's being very hard to find anything.   
I've been asking around and checking on Google/FB but the only thing I could find is a pop concert in Moods, but those CHF30 for an artist I don't know seem a bit excessive. Either way I'll keep the idea as a last option.   
Anyone else has any tips about where to find some live music tonight? I'm up for pretty much anything of a reasonable quality and not too extreme ( jazz, blues, pop, rock, indie, ...)

			I've been living in Lausanne for a while now and it is really beginning to hurt. This place is a musical wasteland. The amount of times I can see something resembling music in a year I can count on one hand.   
So. I wonder. Anywhere in the country are there proper indie bars? 
Indie. Punk. Rock. I'm not picky. I'm just sick of all the pubs playing nightclub 'music' and want to see some live stuff.   
I'm basically just trying to find life, even if it involves a 2 hour train ride.
		    Check out  , they organize gigs at a few places in Geneva. I saw a noise performer from NZ at one their gigs, it was not bad. It is quite experimental. If you want something more palatable, keep an eye on both Unil and EPFL, they have their own music stuff going on. I am sure Geneva uni campuses will also have some music scene.       in Nyon is quite cool, too. Too cool, sometimes, for just a regular music bar, for my taste, lol, but they do bring some interesting foreign projects.    
It is a fraction of what I am used to, but it works. Make an event if you want to hang out with people.
		 
			
			I might be stating the obvious as you are in Lausanne, but les docks has a diverse programme and i agree there are only a hand full of interesting gigs per year but i have seen several good artists play there    
			
			I havent had the chance to go there my self yet, but Frison in Fribourg have, what looks to be a quite interesting program.
		    Pity Zürich is more then 3hrs from Lausanne, there are loads of gigs and festivals throughout the year here, lots of alternative music.
		 
			
			Back in the late nineties, early 2000's all the decent swiss indie bands were from Lausanne. Most of them have broken up now but from what I can gather they're all still active in the music scene there. Le Romandie seems to be the de facto place for the indie scene now.
		 
			
			Really? We've made the trip to Lausanne several times when bands from overseas skipped Zurich to play e.g. Le Romandie on their Europe tours. Have traveled to l'Usine in Geneva too...
		 
			
			La Docks gets maybe 3 or 4 decent C grade international acts a year. Its mostly about international acts, never has small local stuff. 
Romandie....also maybe every few months only they have stuff. 
Will have to check this Nyon place some day
		 
			
			Check out the L'Usine Geneve /PTR.net or the Kofmehl in Solothurn,the Fri-Son in Frison, the Amalgame in  Yverdon les Bains   
Tickets can be purchased at :            I'm by Zurich and I feel your pain.    
With the exception of Radiohead at Openair St.Gallen, and a few of the other bands that played on that day, the choice is somewhat limited.    
The line up for last night at Zurich Openair was decent, but I needed my money for something else. I did check Ticketcorner's listings for the next 6mths, and there was nothing that caught my eye. Quite a few death metal gigs coming up, but that's not my scene either.
		 
			
			Even in London there is not much going on, see for yourself at brixton academy or O2 Forum London, Roundhouse
		    Agreed. There is a bit of a lull at the moment, but I find that when that happens, something great comes along. Two bands I can immediately think of that broke a lull are Guns 'n' Roses and Nirvana, so I live in hope.      
A good 90% of the gigs I've been to were in Manchester and Liverpool, both of which have thriving music scenes, as well as having venues big enough for the biggest international bands. In the two years I spent 'darn Sarf', the only gigs I would have given anything to attend were Prince, particularly the one at Ronnie Scotts, but both me and my OH were on call at that time   Just glad I got to see him back in 2007.     
As with the OP, I'd be grateful if anyone could point me in the direction of decent gig venues, along the lines of The Roadhouse, The Ritz, Big Hands, Jabez Clegg and Academy / Hop & Grape in Manchester, or the L2 in Liverpool. anyone familiar with these will know they're a step up from 'toilet gigs' and where real future talent can be seen.      
Just as an example... The first time I saw The Verve was at The Den (Wigan Bus Driver's social club) in front of less than 100 people. I went to gigs at The Roadhouse when Elbow still worked there as bar staff, and first saw The White Stripes at L2 when Jack White was next to me at the bar getting the band's drinks in. Is there anything along those lines in Switzerland?
		 
			
			Watch out for Down to the Bunker - rock group. They play many gigs in the Lausanne area. Playing up here in our field tomorrow- come along.   
Neuchâtel had a great Buskers festivals week before last- and friends did 2 great gigs at KioskArt- Hang and percussion (with waste materials- it was fabulous).   
There are rock/alternative music festivals all over Romandie right through the Summer too- a few in September.
		 
			
			Here they are in Bangalore- no clips to share from Neuch, apart from on FB:             
Three day festival.....previous acts listed here:    
			
			My turn to ask, does anyone have places to recommend in Zürich?   
And anyone would like to accompany a 40-year old teenager there? Husband not interested in anything involving much electrical guitar, and Junior is still to young (but he has great musical taste).
		    You might be interested in this:    
The venue's in an underground car park in Vevey, about 10 minutes walk from the station (sounds dodgy I know, but trust me!)
		 
			
			Killing Joke 
11.11.2016 in the Dynamo ... if you like loud and alternative ...
		 
			
			Having been to various concerts in Zurich I'm now on the mailing list of many of the concert promoters.  If you sign up for their newsletters you'll find out what's coming up.  Admittedly it's a lot of junk mail but occasionally there's something that catches my eye.  The promoters include Plaza Klub, Ticketcorner, AllBlues Konzert News, Concerts by MAAG, Kaufleuten Klub and Starticket News.   
If I had to recommend just one venue it would probably be Kaufleuten but that's partly because I like the variety of what they offer - concerts and book readings.  There are plenty of other venues where you can see indie music - Volkshaus, Komplex, X-tra, Plaza etc    
If you don't want to get the newsletters but want to know what's on then check out something like Zuritipp.
		 
			
			Volbeat playing in Geneva Arena on 5th November. Seen them live about 3 times and it is a real good live band.   
Tickets 69 CHF       
			
			I went to see Stiff Little Fingers at the   in Luzerne a couple of years back. It is in a converted jail and is pretty much exclusively punk/Indy.
		 
			
			Greetings from Zurich!   
If you are interested in bars also in Zurich I would suggest Mehrspur in Toni Areal!
		 
			
			Might not be the most useful if there's simply nothing around, but I use the Songkick app, then put in a bunch of cities nearby along with bands that I follow. This keeps me up-to-date as to whether specific bands that I like are coming to Switzerland, but also its algorithm has stabs at concerts that I might like anyway. 
Good luck!
		 
			
			++ to Mehrspur in Toni Areal
		 
			
			I like the Bleu Lezard for their program. They get in the same-ish types of gigs that El Lokal does or did in Zurich.

			Hi,   
I'd like to make a present to my wife getting 2 Mamma Mia's tickets for the Basel show.   
I can't find the essential information: is the singing/talking in German or English?   
S.
		 
			
			Hi,    
I've seen the show in Zurich 2 years ago. It was in English. 
Enjoy
		 
			
			According to ticketcorner.ch it is in English.
		    I can't find this...
		 
			
			It's in English (or so the poster says)
		 
			
			We saw it in English a few years ago in Basel. It would never work in German. Go it was great!!!
		 
			
			From the website:   
""-   (Die englische Original-Theaterversion)""   
i.e. in English   
It's a bit tricky to find. Click on Tickets, and then click on the date/show you're considering. Scroll all the way down past the price categories and you'll see the details.
		 
			
			So for those who have attended this musical, in Basel or elsewhere, how was the experience?
		 
			
			Hi,   
We saw it in Zurich & Dublin, English both times, as a crowd of ladies both times we really enjoyed it, sang and danced along. 
Great atmosphere with very talented performers.
		 
			
			We saw it in Brussels and it was fantastic.
		 
			
			Does anyone know if the show is still available in Zurich or Basel? sounds like a fantastic plan...
		 
			
			I went to see the show twice with my OH and another group. Both shows in Basel and Zürich were in English. TBH, the nationalities of the performers was highly diverse. Only the staff and public announcements were made auf Deutsch  .  
I actually really enjoyed it, didnt think it would be my cup of tea.

			Anyone else see this performance last night at Landiwiese, Zurich?   
What did you think?
		 
			
			I saw him a couple of years ago in Moods, he wasn't very enthusiastic to say the least. How was he last night? Not a patch on his old man, although there are some nice Youtube vids of him doing acoustic stuff.
		 
			
			He had a bassist and drummer backing him, and I thought they were all pretty decent musicians and had a good sound. Problem is, they basically just played the same song over and over - same chords, same changes, with different tempo and slightly different guitar lines.     
Definitely not to be compared to his father.    
We lucked out with unexpected free tix so can't really complain, but i'd be pretty dissapointed if we'd coughed up CHF 80- for the show.
		 
			
			He's definitely not an 80.- artist. Yeah it all sounds the same, but people are prepared to pay in Switzerland, I guess. The problem is that many of the great world music stars don't stop off here so often, I guess its the cost of touring in Switzerland is so much higher then the rest of Europe, that they can't be bothered.

			Tickets have just gone on sale today (Monday 30th May) for Paul Simon who's coming to Zurich on November 15.   
There are plenty of people on the forum who are 'of a certain age' who might want to catch the great man. I heard him recently on TV. His voice is still (just) holding up, but he's now in his mid 70s, and I think this may be the last opportunity. My wife managed to bag a couple today but it will sell out quickly.           Last saw him at the Royal Albert Hall performing with Miriam Makeba the day before before re-locating to CH in '87 (having just returned from a few months in S.A).  One of the most amazing experiences of my life.   
Thanks so much for the heads-up!
		 
			
			You're welcome. I would love to have seen him in his earlier days, like you did, or even better, in his S & G period. But I never managed it, so I'm thrilled to finally get the chance.

			there anybody who intends to go to the Greenfield festival this year? I'm definately going, so if some of you will be there as well, we might wanna meet once and have a headbang session together. (or just a pint  )   
			
			Hi Anyuta,   
It is my intention to go but I didn't want to go on my own! 
I will be starting my new job in Basel on the 1st of June so I don't know if it'll be too tight to join you there. 
I would like to go on Friday & Saturday, but I don't have a tent to camp there. What's your plan?
		 
			
			Because the festival starts this year on wednesday , the campsite will be packed , when you arrive on friday. The situation on the campsite can be disgusting sometimes(mud, garbage). 
There is a youth hostel at the station interlaken ost, if you got lucky , you might get a spot, otherwise the hotels on interlaken are on the pricey side. 
There will be a shuttle bus from Interlaken Ost to the festival itself(operating hours are sometimes limited). 
At the campsite there will be a supermarket, otherwise you are allowed to bring 6 L Beer per person to the campsite(to protect the environment). 
The Value for Money Ratio has been better a few years ago,on thursday i like 5 bands, Friday 2, saturday 2. That does not justify an extended stay in interlaken.     
I will visit the fortarock in nijmwegen this year, it is only 2 days, there are 26 bands(mostly metal), i paid 59 euros for the 2 days (early bird) , it is in the city center and there is no camping.   
I can recommend the Summer Breeze Festival as well:       
Been there last year, it was awesome!   
Currently i like more hardcore Punk/ deathmetal/Hardcoremetal, there is not much on offer at greenfield.
		 
			
			Thank you blackbird! 
Too tight for me to go to fortarock, I will be just arrived to Basel! 
I will check the summer-breeze though, but I like the bands in greenfield.   
Is there a good rock / metal scene in Basel? Any pub you recommend with occasional gigs? I will be taking my guitar with me
		 
			
			There are a lot of concerts from that type in pratteln, the Z7     
it is only around 8 mins by train from basel sbb, the walk to the venue is around 10 mins from the station.
		 
			
			I like to the band what come to greenfield festifal, i have some change of the plan but I will do everything possible to go, maybe somebody know some nice rock bars in Zürich or Baden?
		 
			
			Try the hafenkneipe, Militärstrasse 12, Zurich.   
There are not many bars/clubs who play rock in zurich. 
Mostly the people, who like metal/Rock attend the concerts at the dynamo/komplex/volkshaus in zurich for example
		 
			
			Thanks, I will try anyway nothing else to do, make me know about some other festifal or concert! Thanks again
		 
			
			Anyone else interested on Greenfield Festival Friday & Sat???
		 
			
			How much headbang can one offer to the tunes of Red Hot Chilli Peppz??!! They are good but definitely not head banging material lol...   
Kinda missed last year's selection: Slipknot, Lamb of God , Motorhead to name a few...Felt like this year's a bit short of yester's glory   "	9	0	 Apr 2016	['0', '0']	Greenfield Festival 8-11 Juni	Anyuta	3	2331	Concerts

Great band dont lose opportunity to see them live

			Brilliant news. Thanks     
			
			Does anyone know what this Zurich venue (X-tra) is like? I may pick up some tickets for this as I love the band but don't fancy it being too wild. The days of being shoe-horned in, covered in warm beer, are long behind me now.   
Cheers!
		 
			
			Bump. Anyone?
		 
			
			Concerts in Switzerland are rarely, if ever, too wild.  X-tra is big enough for you to stand a little way back if you want to avoid the mosh-pit.  If there are enough people the balcony upstairs may be opened.   
The queues to pick up your coat at the end of the evening can be a bit long if the concert is packed - but that's probably the same at most venues.
		 
			
			Hi everyone! If anyone hears of anyone trying to get rid of tickets, please let me know...I really want to go but I have a friend over who can't afford it. Would buy the ticket for her but she wouldn't accept..
		 
			
			Cool! Thanks for the tips. Will go for sure!
		 
			
			Good luck with that... The concert was over four months ago.
		 
			
			oh no...............so actually it was a long time post............   
			
			Except that... they are playing Zürich Openair in the summer!

Martin Hennig - Clemens Klopfenstein - Marcus P. Nester - Christoph Geiser 
Die Lunte   
Die Autoren Martin Hennig, Clemens Klopfenstein, Marcus P. Nester und Christoph Geiser lesen aus ihren neuen Büchern, moderiert von Sabrina Habel.       
Christoph Geiser: ""Da bewegt sich nichts mehr"" - Erzählungen   
Drei Mordfälle, einer in Leipzig, einer in Berlin, eine Mordserie in Australien. Täter, aber kein schlüssig erklärbares Motiv. Geiser, der Erzähler ist immer nahe dabei, er scheint selbst gefährdet. Als Rechercheur versucht er herauszufinden, was hinter den Morden steckt. Entstanden sind drei anspielungsreiche Texte, die das Material der angeblich die Wahrheit vermittelnden Medienberichte aufnehmen, sie sprachkritisch zerlegen und der Frage nachspüren: Was war wirklich? Bis auch die mediale „Wahrheit“ sich immer mehr auflöst.       
Martin Hennig: ""Teufel, Mestre und Madonna"" - Novelle   
Mathieu verliert sein Herz an Sarah, die  Moderatorin der Wettersendung „Räge, Blitz und Sunneschtrahl“. Die Aussichten für die junge Liebe scheinen, trotz einiger hartnäckiger Nebelschwaden, sehr gut zu sein. Doch dann verliert Mathieu seinen Job und dann die Kontrolle über sein Auto. Tödlich verunfallt, landet er in einer anderen Welt, die ihren ganz eigenen Gesetzen folgt. Auch Sarahs Welt verändert sich, als sie sich auf die Suche nach Mathieu begibt. Es scheint, der Teufel habe seine Hand im Spiel. Aber gibt es den Teufel überhaupt? Eine Erzählung voller überraschender Wendungen und ironischer Pointen, mit blitzenden Dialogen und einem sunneschtrahlenden Surrealismus.        
Clemens Klopfenstein: ""Als ich meine Filme stahl - Das ganze Geständnis""   
""Clemens Klopfenstein ist für uns der unabhängige Filmemacher par excellence - kreativ, temperamentvoll, fantasiereich, humorvoll, dem Experiment aufgeschlossen. Die Lust auf das Abenteuer und die Erkundung des Fremde, Exotischen, aber auch die selbstkritische Observierung des Nahen, Vertrauten und Bekannten sind Klopfensteins Grundmotive. Und immer gibt es bei ihm eine Ebene der Ironie, der Doppeldeutigkeit, des Spiels mit Nuancen.""   
(Aus einem Beitrag des Filmhistorikers Ulrich Gregor)       
Marcus Nester ""Sturzgefahr"" - Krimi-Erzählungen   
Der Basler Autor landete mit der ""Migros - Erpressung"", zusammen mit Clemens Klopfenstein, einen frühen Erfolg und schrieb für die Krimi-Reihe Tatort. Nesters hier vorgelegte Erzählungen handeln von Menschen, die sich in Gefahr begeben und darin umkommen - oder fast. Die Grenzen zwischen Opfer und Täter sind fließend: Bei einem übereifrigen Steuerbeamten und einem fast unbescholtenen Steuerzahler, bei einem allzu gerissenen Zürcher Politiker und seiner unehelichen Tochter und bei einem Ehepaar, das von gegenseitigem Misstrauen so zerfressen ist, dass es den äußeren Horror erst bemerkt, als es zu spät ist.

			Hi Mods,   
Our concerts calendar is rarely used yet in the   there are lots of threads with info which many would find useful, but it's buried away.   
Any chance of just dumping the Concerts Calendar and using the link to take us to the relevant Concerts subforum?   
I often don't know if I'm going to a concert until the last minute and as I understand the calendar requests you only make an entry if you're attending. Seems a bit of a faff to fill in all the info unless the User is going. Should users wish to create an event there is already the 'Social Events' calendar which in most cases is clearly not a commercial post albeit for a commercial event.   
Thanks.
		 
			
			Seems a fair point, and I'll request it.  Can't make any promises though.
		 
			
			It's been done.

			Hi Guys,   
Skunk Anansie is coming to ZH on Feb 16th. I was on their concert last year. They really kicked ass : -)))   
Details below       
			
			Ugh. The tickets are: z.Zt. nicht verfügbar (not available at the Moment)                
			
			I adore Skunk Anansie and this year I am planning to go to one of their concerts that would be near my country. All their songs are powerful, and the lead singer is excellent    
			
			Skunk Anasie will play the Heitere Open Air in Zofingen (Friday 12 August) and 
in Strasbourg Jun 25 th Saturday

			For those who REALLY have nothing better to do on Saturday 30th January, the Alphüttli of Geneva organise a Swiss yodel evening, including Alphüttli themselves, Oliver Marti who'll play the Alpine flute (no, not horn!) and a Chinderjodlerchörli ""De Bärge zue"" who'll also do their bit.     
Venue: Salle des fêtes de  Carouge. Doors open at 6.00 p.m., concert starts at 8.00 p.m.. Food (braised beef, potato mash and carrots) will be served before and after the show, and there will be a cake stall, a cheese stall and a bar, of course. Then the ""Sigriswiler Orgerlifäger"" band will kick off a dance evening, no doubt quite oom pa pa dancing to keep with the theme.     
No pre-booking, tickets on the door (15 CHF, food extra)     
IF you look very hard, you might spot poor me, the only non-Swiss on stage, who does not understand a single word of what he's singing. I should be dripping with sweat trying to remember this Martian language. This alone should be entertaining!   
			
			...can someone tell me what ""Verschau nüd wä"" means? Cheers.
		 
			
			This is wonderful how the EF community ALL have something great to do at the week-end (chalet up in the mountains, visiting friends, exploring museums, sunbathing, hiking, skiing...). Can we remove the ""complaints"" thread now?   
			
			I added the date to the title, and the fact you're performing.   Do you have a video or photo to share too? How will we know whom to make fun of if you blend in like a local?   
PS - Remember to include this bit on your naturalization application!    
			
			Google Translate tells me that Verschau nüd wä means ' Vorschau Nut War' in estonien; pretty sure that's not right!   
Sadly Ill be stuck indoors with my knitting that evening... due to lack of transport, the folllowing weekend I could have dragged hubbie along. He'd have loved it!   
Patsycat has said she might be going, I expect she'll be along later to confirm or deny.
		 
			
			I definitely don't think that the Estonian version is the right one! Mind you, I've had to imagine all sorts of outrageous meanings to be able to memorise the words! In my twisted imagination, ""I Reihe ond Reihe, do stoht Hag om Hag, ir taufrische Wese för d'Verschau parat"" becomes "" Ay, row on row, do throw hag on hag, her fresh tow and Visa for the Love Parade""!!     
Yes, I know...   
			
			Good for you!! Fantastic that you have joined the group and if I was able to be in Geneva on Saturday I would have definitely come!to see you perform! 
( If I still lived in Geneva I would have loved to have joined up and had a go too!)
		     
Do not worry! Even though I will wear the same (o so flattering!) outfit as everyone else  , I am the only one who does not understand the words of the 8 yodels (except the one in French), there are two yodels I just cannot memorise so I just do the yodel bit and not the sung bit and I'm bringing the average age down by quite a few year!   
Basically, the small nervous guy looking like he's completely out of place, on the right (Bass 2) will be me!     
I'll also be serving the drinks at the bar during the interval (so I was told!) and after the show, so anyone can place their orders in English!
		    GOOD idea for the naturalisation! Mind you, I might make such a mess of it that I could end disqualified forever, so that as not to bring further shame on Switzerland!   
			
			Sorry!!  Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it either on Saturday.   
I hope you have a great time, I will get in touch when we are next having drinks.
		 
			
			More misinterpretations and mispronunciations: one yodel called  ""Veschau-Morge"" I was convinced was about a bride and a wedding is in fact about cows and cattle fair...no wonder I was not giving out the right vibes! Needless to say I came up with all sorts of theories to memorise ""Dehender zuet Schell-Chüü wie ds herrlich Cheit""!  
The problem is that at rehearsal last night I lunged out the last word as I thought it was...wrong! Say ""Rayt""! I can't get it off my head, it will be interesting to see which version comes out on Saturday!     
I genuinely feel sorry for you poor souls who live on the other side of the Röstigrabe, how can you cope with this extra-terrestrial language?

			Does anyone have some good recommendations to go listen to good groups that play live classical music? I've been to Vienna, Salzburg and Heidelberg to listen to different groups so far so that's the ""standard"" I'm looking at. But I'm looking for more local stuff. I know there's plenty of concerts that are advertised out there, any that one would recommend?   
I've heard enough of Mozart for the moment, but Bach is always welcome no matter how many times I've heard the pieces (Brandenburger Concertos and Violin Concertos) and the same goes for Vivaldi, especially Vivaldi at the moment. Strauss would also be nice to hear again.   
Please share your classical music experiences here!
		 
			
			We live in Lausanne and attend concerts for the Romandie and Lausanne orchestras.  Sometimes local churches will have concerts so we peruse the local papers.  In the summer, they also hold outdoor concerts which are nice simply because of the venues.  So maybe check out your local papers, communal boards, or go online to find the larger orchestras in your area.   
As to the choice of music, we also have been to Vienna and Strasberg to see concerts.  Like those locales, it does seem what is played here is quite repetitive.  All the Classical guys (Bach, Handl, etc).  I like the Nationalists, so when a Berlioz, Mussorsky, Prokofiev shows up on the bill, rarely, we try to see it.     
Good luck.
		 
			
			I'm no fan myself, but the Luzern Festival is world renowned for classical music, performed at the KKL. Well worth seeing from what I've been told, but tickets for some concerts are sold out far in advance.       
			
			I like Luzern Festival pretty much. It is quite enjoyable!
		 
			
			Orchestra of Tonhalle Zürich and an optional concert series crossing classical with electronic music: TonhalleLate
		 
			
			I have recently discovered that Tonhalle in Zurich does not advertise most of the gigs of visiting orchestras and smaller groups on their website. Ticketcorner has a lot of them listed though, so maybe you could try that?
		 
			
			Hi guys 
I am new here in the forum   
I am professional cellist graduate from basel academie as cello solo degree. now i am here for few years with my husband.i as freelance musician play all different place or opportunity, solo concert with orchestra, solo recital, orchestra leader, section player, play opera, symphony....i am also member of verbier music festival chamber orchestra. It is really hard to feed your self as this profession in here. I have tried times for audition in orchestra job. so far no good new.I don mind be freelance but I wish I can have more chance to play. 
I also have a few great musician friends who are very high level of professional playing.same as me looking for opportunity as free lance player.we were trying to make a trio, we had rehearsal and trying looking for some chance. is someone know any chance that we can give concert and will be proper paid? or any chance we can have chance to give a concert?? or sort of musician management??   
for those who interested you want to know more about me just type in google search: 
mi zhou cello 
i am chinese.   
Thank you very much! 
mi
		    I'm not in this situation myself but know several people who have joined a friends of the Tonhalle society and this not only gets them some tickets at a better price but means they can come in and listen to rehearsals etc for free (and of course get informed when those rehearsals etc are).   
I got taken as a guest a couple of times and watching them practice is really interesting, as you get to understand the sort of stuff a conductor watches out for, stops the music, explains something, and makes them do it again. It makes you apprecaite the work that goes into producing a concert, but also some of the finer points of musical listening and interpretation that as a musical philistine, I would never have picked up by myself.   
There were only about four people besides us so it was quite an experience having a full orchestra perform for such a handful.

Marie comes across as a beautiful, talented and confident young woman.

Yes! Dear Robszon, this is the point that I was talking about, the Riverside music band z Polce  viva            Hello,  
Thanks, I love the football as wellbut the point is music concert and my post was on this part, 
By the way 
Thank you so much   
			
			I know this music band from many years ago.      
They started play together in 2003. From that time they develope their own precise, unique style and sounds beyond boundieries. 
I never was Progressive Rock Music fan before but from the time I have heard their third album Voices In My Head, I become one. I belive they keep transmiting the important, timeless message to everyone.   
I want to go to see them playing life here in Switzerland.  
Lion Shepherd(PL) and The Sixxis (USA)are the bands choosen as supports.  
I dont know their music well but I like a lot one of the Lion Shapperd song       
If I will have some more informations I will keep you posted.

tonight at Temple St Etienne in Moudon, at 17.00   
Chexbres Temple on 13th November at 20.00 
and 
Lutry Temple, 15th November at 17.00   
I know armistice day is 11.11. but celebrated today in London and all over UK. The musicians accompanying the chorists were amazing- and the 'Last Post' by the excellent trumpetist was particularly poignant.

			Saw this last night. The visual and auditory experience was absolutely amazing!!! Ballet+Lady Gaga+hip hop+Indian dance+ballroom dance (cha cha cha), all elements used to create beautiful body movements.   
I did manage to refrain myself from correcting the (German) speaker of the pre-show meeting who said that   is a palindrome ( ).     
Downsides:  
1. The program was only in German, although one of the three choreographers is an American, and another (the Israeli) was educated in the US (at Julliard) and is married to an American. 
2. This program was FOR SALE for CHF 9!!!!   
Does anyone know of other venues where one can see such shows?

My favourite band.....saw them in Paris, will be going to London but thinking about driving up to Zurich tomorrow and chancing my luck on the door.   
Think it'll be the last time they tour. Have watched them since 1976 and seen them live around 20 times. But never in Switzerland

			Hi,    
For few months I use nice page to look for classical concerts in Zürich. 
There is a lot happening in this area (few concerts in a week) in the churches. They can be found under the link:     
			
			Hi, 
How does it work? Do you need any membership card or so?  
Thanks in advance for letting me know   
			
			There is a lot of free concerts where you can simply get in.  
Sometimes it might be strange, as long as you will shake a hand of a pastor when you leave    
But the concerts are great very often.

			Hi Everyone!   
Just a quick question. I haven't found any thread about the Street Parade which will happen this weekend in ZH.   
Is there anyone who plans to attend? Could be a great way to have fun and meet people    
Cheers! 
LLaP
		 
			
			Don't expect to hold a meaningful conversation - free earplugs provided...
		 
			
			It depends, it could be a nice place to socialize, I guess... At least something to start with... at least outside the net...     
			
			the real street parade:       
			
			Zurich in early morning hours after the parade looks like a war zone. 
Rubbish everywhere, disgusting smell around the lake.......   
At the parade itself, make friends (peace and love)  ........ 
If you like it go for it, if not stay away.
		    Do you know how many people'll be attending and the FILTH the city's covered in the next day? It's crazy.       
and    
Not to mention that socializing with puking people isn't very appetizing        
What is amazing is how quickly the city cleans up the mess.  What I saw was that by the time morning traffic came on, its like none of it ever took place.  Kudos to the city and the planners for getting their crap together.
		    Soooooooo cool       Now I feel hungry.
		    The lost banknote in those pictures was only a 50Fr? I was expecting a 1000Fr for Zurich    
			
			So, was anyone at the Street Parade? According to news, it was quite peaceful.
		 
			
			Did I hear right? One million visitors?? That can't be right, where did they put them all?   
My German isn't great, so I can't swear to it, but that's what I thought I heard on the radio.      Yup, 1M.  And no major incidents. 
Zurich, I LOVE you.
		    Many camp on every bit a green all around the lake into neighbouring lake-side communities...
		    Yup, saw they were camping outside my apartment (nice little enclave 5 mins from city) on the way to the Migros this morning i.e. beach lounge-chair / unknown sleeping on it / other unknowns sitting around on chairs sipping their Pimms from cans.   
But, it's once a year!  Did you experience Switzerland before the Street Parade was allowed  .
		 
			
			The organizers said that one million had taken in the event but they tend to blow up the figures to impress the sponsors and the like. Anyway it's very difficult to acurately estimate the size of such a large crowd.
		    On taking my usual Sunday morning stroll downhill to the Hauptbahnhof for my next bottle, and expecting to have to step over the odd syringe or body, I instead came across the following:  2 empty plastic cups, a red bull can and an apple core.  Not even the usual smelly places were smelly  .     
Love ya Zuri!!!
		         
Terrible, hope you reported all this rubbish         Thanks, I didn't realise that I should report it.  Is there a link?
		       
Enjoy!         
This estimated number always gets me too. Anyone seeing the Arsenal crowd or Wembley will know what 50,000 people look like. Imill people would be one out of eight Swiss, or getting on for 2/3  of the population of Kanton Zurich. (My neighbours were all at home). There would also have had to have been dozens of extra trains, trams, buses, taxis and so on. I reckon there were at the most 70,000 and even that is doubtful.
		           
You do not live near a major railway line then? 
There were extra foreign trains thundering past all morning!
		     
There were 15 extra trains on Saturday into Zurich. If one train can cope with 1,500 people - and that would be a wonder - then 22,500 people came by extra trains. If the half of one million, that is 500,000 people came by 'foreign' extra trains @ 1500 per train you'd need 333 trains pulling into the HB. Then they'd all have to go somewhere to park until going back when 500,000 people would go to the bahnhof...Plus drivers, platforms, trains, - there isn't so much rolling stock... And the other 500,000 ? where did they come from? 
And so on.
		     
According to this site there were over 100 extra trains in Zürich      
			
			X Nacht ZVV und (15 SBB) extrazüge count of course - but as I pointed out it would be impossible to bring 1 million people into Zuri, for the reasons I gave. But the 1 mill number seems to have embedded itself into the consciousness of the media so let's grin and bear it,  
But I'll still say grrr next year!!!
		 
			
			Busby when you said 70,000, did you mean 700,000 btw? or did you mean 70,000?
		    I don't know where they put them all but I know where they took a piss, all I could smell cycling from Enge to Utoquai this morning was urine and this time I hadn't pissed myself.
		    yeah. i'm trying to avoid zurich until there's been a good few days of rain       One four-carriage unit of the modern trainsets can take just under a thousand people. So the twelve-carriage units could carry almost three thousand.   
Also it wouldn't just be the extra trains - the existing ones are extended to carry more people.   
I agree overall the number is   too high though. Compare to Glastonbury - about 140'000 people, or Edinburgh Hogmanay - 100'000 people.
		 
			
			Well not everybody would have come by train, and also consider that a reasonable proportion of the ""guests"" are likely to have come from the immediate surrounding areas.   
Also bear in mind that the space required to hold a million people shoulder to shoulder and butt to gut is around 125,000 square metres (based on the assumption that a person requires a space of 0.5 by 0.25 metres to stand) - that's only a square of approximately 350 x 350 metres.   
Basically it's not inconceivable that there were in total about 1 million guests, especially when you take into account that not everybody who visited would've all been there at exactly the same time. People come and go.
		       
I did mean 70,000, that would be a sensible number seeing the small amount of possible visitors available. That the total may have varied with comers and goers is also valid - just look at a football crowd next time Wembley is on TV - these are counted people.
		    Somebody counted people during the streetparade: 1041 emergencies were carried to the hospitals. 470 emergency responders were around helping people. I think it makes little sense to discuss if it were 700.000 or 800.000 but there clearly are WAY more people than in a stadium around.
		    was riding my motorcycle through the city 2 hours ago and it smells like piss all over where the parade was....
		    Yeah, it's always like that. It will, however, rain tomorrow and Wednesday so that should help to wash it away.
		 
			
			There must have been a similar number of people escaping Zurich and heading south judging by the traffic on Saturday morning
		    - glad I missed it.    
			
			There's a   in my   and it's still buzzing about the '1,000,000' people 'present' at the Street Parade again this year.     
Yesterday I watched the Great North Run on TV. I like to watch this because I'm a Geordie from the banks of the Tyne.  The Great North Run is a half-marathon which starts in Newcastle and ends in South Shields. There were 55,700 participants. All of them wearing numbers.  
Now, just to say, in defence of my Bee. These 55,700 runners were packed together, spread over   carriaged roads for one kilometre behind the start line. If therefore we wanted to have 1m people at the SP we'd need 19 X 55.700 people standing tightly packed on the lakeside road leading from Zurich to Rapperswil - in fact the crowd would stretch almost to Rapperswil if the road would be equal to two dual carriageways.     
In the light of this, my estimated guess of 70,000 would still be too high and was anyway only indulged in out of the goodness of my heart. If anyone wants proof then just look at the starting mass of any other marathons - London - Berlin - Vienna and all the rest, and you'll see for yourselves.

I live in Lausanne and there are some concerts i'm planning to go to in Pratteln, and as I have no company I thought I ask if there's anyone going there (from any city along the way from Lausanne to Pratteln) so maybe we can share the same car or something, as I actually don't have a car and trying to save on the transport cost  .

			Hi EFers, 
I just want to let you know about our event at the Alte Botanischer Garten, Zürich. 
Lügenspiel ( Lying Game) is an audio play, similar to a radio play, in which three strangers play a game where they must tell three stories, two true and one a lie, which prove to have unexpected consequences. 
The play is in High German, available all week to hear on ipods, but on Monday 6 July, at 5pm, it will be played over a speaker system. 
There are other artworks by Isabelle Capron, Anna Veen, and Lisa Stadler. 
Oh yeah, and later at 7pm, John Cleese will be reading from his autobiography! 
Here is a link to the main programme:     
cheers, Morph

			At the behest of my other half, I went to see One Republic last night in Zürich. Having never been to Hallenstadium before I must say I was impressed with the venue, good access, reasonable prices for food and drink and all the rest. Not really being a One Rebublic fan,I thought the show was absolutely fantastic, these guys really put it on for the crowd, clearly demonstrating that they love what they do. What didn't impress me was the almost obsessive and quite pathetic use of smartphones. We were quite close to the stage and every single time a popular song came on, straight away the smartphones came out and up in the air. So instead of looking at the band, I could only see a sea of tiny coloured screens.Why oh why to people need to record everything, why cant they just live for the moment.   
			
			I absolutely agree with this. I was there too and also suprised by people checking their facebook account or keeping making videos. How many of them would really look at them 2months after the concert? Probably none of them. 
Life is short. Live now.

			Hello everyone!   
I was wondering if there is any EDM ( Electronic Dance Music) festivals in Switzerland besides the streetparade in Zurich?   
Cheers
		 
			
			There's the   in Geneva amongst others... You often get EDM acts at various music festivals on some nights, Avenches or Festi'Neuch for example. There used to be Vision Festival up on Marbachegg but it doesn't look like it exists anymore.
		 
			
			only noobs call it EDM, hence you wont find any.

			Talk about real experience in recording,engineering bands and mixing them.   
My dear longtime talented Swiss friend over 20 years Heinz owned a well-known studio ""The Place"" in Lucerne for years. 
Heinz Affolter,has now a serious working recording studio;and he can do just about anything at his beautiful studio called Lakeside Studio. 
This is also not an ad;but a recommendation.        When I was over in Switzerland I met up with a friend who is currently working with Heinz and his group Acoustic Adventure.  He also gave be some of his CDs   "	2	6	 Sep 2010	['22', '678', '10', '240']	Do you want to produce a CD for yourself or your group?	Odile	19721	1361	Concerts

			For all jazz fans in Lausanne - here's a good club that hosts 2-3 concerts every week, some of them free entrance! (others around 20-30 CHF) The atmosphere is nice and cosy, they also serve dinner... worth paying a visit        
			
			Yep, best kept secret in Lausanne. Chorus also has certain nights where it is a themed CD night, and there are some real afficiandos down there.   
Quality jazz assured, and a great night out any night there is a gig. In my very humble opinion!   
			
			Chorus is really fantastic, we are regulars! 
There's the Gilad Hekselman trio in town, with Joe Martin on bass and Jeff Ballard on drums, at Espace Culturel des Terreaux March 25th at 20:30.  World class musicians from NYC.

			I'm bringing a few school-aged girls to see Katy Perry at the Hallenstadion in March and we're trying to figure out roughly what time the concert will end in order to organize transportation back (it's a school night).    
The concert starts at 19:45 pm. For some reason I have in my head that it will (or needs to?) end by 10 pm, but am not sure. Thanks for your input!
		    Usually between 10:30-11:00pm, IME.
		 
			
			Here's a tip - if you're going by car, you can pay for the parking in advance.
		    Thanks. I actually hadn't considered parking there but taking the train. Is it right at the Hallenstadion?
		 
			
			You can take the train to the station ""Oerlikon"", the Hallenstadion can be reached by bus (No.94) or is in walking distance (10 mins)
		    Number 11 tram goes directly by there as well.
		 
			
			We're actually travelling from the 'burbs and could take the S-bahn....but now I am rather intrigued by the parking idea because I'd like to get out of there as quickly as possible! But maybe traffic is also quite heavy after a concert?
		    As Tram 11 stops at Hallenstadion, I think it's better to park several stops away.  After the concert, take the Tram back and at least avoid the ""congested"" area.
		 
			
			After the concert, most people walk to the oerlikon station, because the bus  or tram service is limited( capacity problem as well) and the distance to the station.
		    Then take the train, l drove there once never again, the queue to get out of that car park was just crazy.
		 
			
			Maybe it is worth checking out reviews for the band you will be seeing - it might give a clue as to the length of their usual live set.   
cheers, 
Nick
		    most times main acts do have an support act. they get on stage 8 and play 30 mins. so the main act starts 21-21:30 and they play 1-1:30h so 10:30-11:00 its done.
		 
			
			Thanks everyone. Yes, opening act (a bit late, but good -- Charlie XCX) for appx. 30 min then Katy Perry went on. I think we left the stadium around 22:45.    
Fortunately someone offered to pick us up after the concert from the hotel across the street so no transportation delays, and the girls were bed at a ""reasonable"" hour. They had an absolute blast at the concert   Me, well I remember when concerts involved bands actually playing instruments, not sing along to backup tracks   But overall, a very entertaining evening!

But maybe I wrong. I'd love to be enlightened! So does anyone here know a simple, plain pub where you can sit at a table and enjoy a beer while listening to some indie band on a little stage in the corner... A pub like you would find all over the place in SanFran or Montréal. Anyone?       As far as I know there are no pubs that have bands playing regularly like you have described. There are a few live music venues, however, some of which have been mentioned already...   
The hirscheneck is a good pub/restaurant which has bands playing regularly, but it is in the basement and you have to pay (it is quite cheap though)        
			
			Thank you all - I just moved to Basel for three months and live music venues was the first thing I was looking for!
		 
			
			Not sure if it counts as live music venue but if you like electronic music, I can definetely suggest Hinterhof. Really good ""real"" Electronic music performers play at the weekends.
		 
			
			You can't go wrong with z7 if you like a bit of rock,  seen some decent acts there over the year.    
Kaserne is also a nice place especially in the summer.    
Sommercasino is more grungy and full of youths drinking outside, which I used to partake in the good old days    
			
			Hi All,   
Are there any live music venues in Basel?  I have walked around down town but onlysaw pubs and bars, no live bands. Not looking for a massive music hall just a small space where local type bands play.  Is the music scene in Switzerland big?  Thanks!   
			
			Just came across this - there's quite some stuff you might like:   
Hirschi  
'tis:  
Kuppel:  
Kaserne:  
Sommercasino:    
Enjoy :-)
		 
			
			In the place we went for drinks, they have a Monday Jazz night... Though I wonder now if it's live. 
Also I want to check   they have it live for sure.
		 
			
			Thanks!     
I also got the following suggestions from some Swiss people I met the other day: 
 Volkshaus 
 Kaserne 
 Quersfeld   
Will probably check them out at some point soon so if your interested let me know.
		 
			
			The Z7 venue in Pratteln is about the most visited venue in the Basel area. It is a heavy rock /metal type large hall in an industrial area and great for that kind of stuff, but don't expect 5 star hotel class lavatories. I have seen several big names there like Journey, Porcupine Tree, Blackfield and IQ for example.
		 
			
			That's good, I might check at those places myself. This is what I miss most going to Live music venues!
		   I have seen some pretty good live bands at Red Rocks, near Huewaage. But not on all days, so may be next time you head there (its a nice bar in any case) you can figure out days when they have live bands   
			
			Cargo bar also has live music from time to time -    
and this site provides a quick overview on what's going on in Basel e.g. live music:

			Summerdays 2015 on Friday 28 August in Arbon has a great line up again. Having been soaked the last two times that I went, perhaps they are due sunshine this time. The festival will be opened by Fish, the former lead singer of Marillion. Next is Ian Anderson with his new band ""The Best of Jethro Tull"". Also The Alan Parsons Project. Top of the bill is Deep Purple for rocking moments and ""Smoke on the Water of Lake Constance"". The Baseballs concludes the first night.   
The Saturday night continues to be generally Swiss acts       
Additionally, the same acts will be performing at the Summernights Festival on the German side of the lake on the opposite nights

			Does anyone know what the venue is like? How many people, etc. Seen them a few times but would love to see them in a small venue.
		 
			
			The venue is pretty small, holds up to 500 people(depending if the balcony is used or not), there will be not many people (entry will 65 sfr).
		 
			
			Wow.   
i think that has made my decision... bearing in mind most decent bands in the UK play at the 02 (which is awful) a 500 person venue is a bit good   
Tickets shall be bought
		 
			
			Am pretty bummed out I missed this show.... Interpol was one of my favorite bands back in the day.
		 
			
			I also feel terrible that I missed this concert.

			played by Daniel Waples- I could listen to him all day.           
			
			Oh for sure its definitely one of the best new musical instruments. If only I had the budget and the proper equipment to record it.....
		 
			
			I'd just love to buy one and learn...Amazing.   
First time I ever heard it was in Luzern- a Swiss street player who also had the most amazing voice- like a Tibetan monk siniging from the guts. If anyone knows who this guy is- I'd love to know if I can buy some of his music. He also played the Alpine horn- had one of those carbon fibre folding ones that fitted in a small suitase. We stayed there for about 2 hrs, listening to him- OH had to drag me away.   
Trying to get Daniel Waples to come and play at the Neuchâtel Buskers festival next year. He said he will teach me if I put him up and feed him- v. good looking and dreads, lol (but old enough to be my grandson, hey ho).
		 
			
			The first time I heard it was amongst the concrete slabs at the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin. It gave me goose pimples and heightened my emotions even more. Hauntingly beautiful.
		   
Another player.
		    As it looks to be a diatonic instrument it should be pretty simple - you can't really hit a bum note.   
However you would need 12 of them to cover all western keys and standard scales, and you'd be stuck to one octave   
Actually I'm now quite interested as well.
		 
			
			Slaphead- that would do me fine. I am a absolute musical failure, born of musical parents. Mum played the piano and cello to professional standard, dad played the trombone and saxophone. They did everything they could to get me interested- but I just wanted to ski, play hockey and climb trees- and listen to rock- and went to live in London to be near the late 60s music scene (Isle of Wight 1970 being the highlight).   
My parents were so proud that our daughters both got Grade 8 piano, and one grade 5 cello and the other grade 5 clarinet and sax. Talents do jump generations at times. I do so envy people who can play an instrument well. OH never had a chance to learn- pennies were very tight and then his other studies and work took every second of his time. But at the ripe old age of 63 when we got here, he decided to learn..... the accordion! The one instrument I can't stand- having never learnt to even read music. he is so determined and has a brilliant teacher (I teach her kids English and German in exchange)- who is a very famous Swiss player- and he has become quite proficient- fortunately learning jazz and French tunes of the 60s instead of Swiss humpah style (pheeew). He is so clever and determined- whereas I just give up if I don't get it straightaway! (he needs the patient of a Saint to be married to me for almost 44 years, hey)!   
You can't buy a hang from any shop- and you have to go and visit the makers and make a case for yourself- they only sell to you if they like you, your music and attitude, etc. Daniel said he would intercede for me   
			
			Thanks for sharing.  Lovely sounds!    
Never heard of the Neuchâtel Buskers festival before, but that sounds like a great reason to visit Neuchâtel soon!    
			
			It is huge fun- and the artists are very carefully selected and all excellent. Get in touch if you come along.
		 
			
			buskers festival is great! we love to go each year. wonderful atmosphere and things to see. a friend of ours came from france a few years ago with no way to get in touch with the hang makers (i think in bern) she happened to find them and had a serendipitous meeting with them and then returned in a few months to pick up her hang drum. not a usual story but she was very devoted and very lucky. it's a really cool instrument- haunting sound
		 
			
			The first time I've heard somebody play the ""hang"" was at a little market in Zurich's Niederdorf. I liked the soothing way it sounded. Also, as OP mentioned, it is quite appealing, that you cannot just go out and buy a ""Hang""; possible buyers get carefully selected.
		    I find it odd that there should be restriction on who should own a so-called musical instrument.  That's about as anti art and creativity as possible.
		    on one hand, I can understand that they want to maintain a high standard of quality with these instruments. on the other hand, it's like you said: they restrict art and creativity by only allowing a select few to acquire them. Imagine if the same approach was had with guitar? Countless genres of music would be lost.
		 
			
			It's possible to buy a copy; it's only the original manufacturer who applies this control.
		    Is this a bit like a Strad then? Lots of those around, authentic copies o
		    Not legally. The unique steel hardening process for the Hang is patented.
		 
			
			This is a great one, if you are into this sort of thing...       
			
			Never heard of this before. Are they all played by hipsters?    
			
			Strange name to give it ..... even in DE it translates to slope or hillside, which is only vaguely representative of the shape; but maybe something a bit more applicable and imaginative could have been found?   
Unless, of course, you know different ......
		     
Hippies, not hipsters
		 
			
			I think it's the emperors new clothes.  There is plenty of music out there which already sounds like that device.  Looks like a good money making scheme.
		    It's the Bernese for ""hand"".   
And the plural of Hang is Hanghang, in case you were wondering.
		      Not convinced ... but will give the benefit of the doubt   
My guess would be that it was invented for a marching gugle band, and the player had to hang it round his neck.       Yes, but it was the Hang which set the tone (pun intended). It took years of development to achieve the right steel-hardening process which gives the Hang its particular resonance patterns.
		    It's not always about the sound, it's often the interaction with instrument that's the most important thing   
Sure, I could probably sit down for a couple of hours with an FM synth or a physical modelling synth and come up with a patch which sounded pretty similar, but then I'd only have the sound, not the interaction, and it's often the interaction that defines what you get out of the instrument.
		 
			
			It sounds very nice and is very clever but I'm not sure I could listen to it for a prolonged period. It all gets a bit 'samey' after a while.
		    Well the guy we heard play the Hang in Luzern- for the first time- looked more like a bank manager, actually- short hair, very 'normal' and in his late forties perhaps.   
Must say I much prefer Daniel's beaming smile and dreads   
Which instrument has a similar sound MidfieldGeneral? The reason it blew my mind and took my heart, was because I'd never heard anything like it. The harp perhaps, which is hugely difficult to learn and also to transport. BTW I'd love to hear someone play Philiip Glass's 'Metamorphosis' on the hang (normally the harp). I love the simplicity of the hang- how easily it can be taken around- and also the vibrations, which to some extent reminds of Tibetan healing bowls. They produce very few, by hand and by very skilled people, themselves I believe. They do not want to go into mass production and lose the unique qualities- so select who they sell to, good on them. I've met so many painters, sculptors and other artists who have to sell to people they don't like, to make a living, investors who not only know nothing about art, but more importantly don't even like or appreciate what they buy. And they hate it- and wish they could only sell to people who'd love what they produce.
		    Good point. It's the manufacturers restrictions that make me suspicious. Anyway sorry I don't mean to derail the thread as if the hang gives people pleasure then that's cool
		    In those hats?
		    They started out with the idea of creating a new instrument for posterity. After about 15 years of research into metallurgy and acoustics, and thousands of prototype instruments, they finally succeeded in getting the sound they wanted. All their instruments are made by hand, and they are all unique. They didn't only have to design the instrument; they also had to develop the manufacturing and tuning techniques, none of which existed before. After all that effort, I think they deserve to give them or sell them to whoever they want.
		    Then it's more like a patented tool than a musical instrument?  I wasn't going to Post here again but you dragged me back       No, they want them to be used to make music, not to be an ornament.   
If you have a business with limited production facilities for a desired musical product then you have a few options in terms of how you sell it.   
1) Raise the price to astronomical levels so that then only those who can afford it can buy it. Downside is that it looks good on the wall of rich people's houses, but nobody is playing it.   
2) First come first served. Ok, seems fair, but with this method the truth is that the majority of them will be left gathering dust in much the same way a lot of guitars end up gathering dust, and as a result put those who can really make use of them on an endless waiting list   
3) Selectively sell to musicians who really want to use them, and will use them.   
Number 3 is by far the best option for all concerned IMO.
		    Ah, you couldn't resist!   
Well, the patent is so that they can keep the marauding hordes of quick-buck-seekers at bay - people who are eager to mass-produce crap copies which would damage the reputation of the Hang. For the same reason, the word Hang is protected by a trademark, so only a real Hang made down on the banks of the Aare in Bern can be called a Hang.
		 
			
			Wow - must be really sorry times if I missed *this* thread. 
I've been aching for a Hang for a lifetime. I still have their phone # somewhere. Tried calling them many times and never got through. I played one once, think it was tuned to D Dorian. As Slaphead said some posts ago, it's all about the interaction, the physicality, the vibrations that you feel in your legs. and of course the Tone (in the six stringed world that would be ""Mojo""). 
Out of sheer frustration I purchased a Roland Handsonic unit and hooked it up to a synth and programmed something that sounded similar. But no. 
The Hang is unique. 
I still want one. 
Anyone selling?... 
¿ Please ?

As the release of  s third album nears,   and   are offering up another taste of   with new track  LP   is due out on     & the band are set to tour across Europe this spring.   
Whereas debut single,  featured West Coast punk vibes,   presents a cosmic trucker boogie and recognizes no journey is possible without being on the road.          was written entirely during  an evolving phase for Moon Duo. It was a rare and uneasy rest period,  devoid of the constant adrenaline of performing live and the stimulation  of traveling through endless moving landscapes. This offered Moon Duo a  new space to reflect on all of these previous experiences and cradle  them while cultivating the album in the unfamiliar environment of a new  dwelling; a dark Portland basement. It was from this stir-crazy fire  that   was forged.   
Catch the three-piece Moon Duo band    (guitars),   (keys) and   (drums) -- all over the U.S. and Europe beginning at the end of this month.

			I love Jazz and was wondering where you can listen to good jazz in central Switzerland? Thank you!
		   , ZH. Wait until the students have stopped their ""...don't it make your brown eyes blue"" guff and enjoy the music professors  do their jam stuff around midnight.
		 
			
			There's loads of Jazz in Luzern, I'm not a huge fan myself, but there's stuff I like, so will go and check stuff out occasionally.     
The music school in luzern is quite famous, it's associated with the Jazzkantine bar and they put on many Jazz nights.    
KKL has many concerts, I just saw Herbie Hancock Will be playing in December.    
The Montana hotel is another famous location that has regular sessions.    
There's a ton load of talented musicians in the area, and you can find live music all over town if you look. I regularly check   for ideas.  It has most clubs and bars doing events there, but if you're into the scene, I'd recommend getting to know people in the scene, there are smaller venues and locations that don't really advertise but put on great stuff.
		 
			
			useful website for you :    
enjoy !

		    Do I need to buy a ticket or I could just walk in anytime?

			Hi guys!   
I was wondering if anyone attending Manowar, 18. Jan '15 in Basel was interested in joining me for an awesome end to the weekend with great music!!   
Cheers        
			
			I am going, and would be happy to join you.
		 
			
			Hi guys, i'm going to attend the gig as well. 
I'm going alone and I'd be glad to join someone on their way to the location. 
I'm staying near the basel sbb station and i'm so not familiar with Basel.
		 
			
			here they are in all their glory....
		 
			
			So many hair back then    
			
			Oh brilliant what a troop! I'd love to meet you guys :-) looking forward!

			Went to see the romantic comic opera, MARTHA, last night and found it very entertaining! Set in 18th century England, Lady Harriet and her servant, Nancy, found themselves extremely bored, so disguised as maids they ventured out to the local market.   
Their little adventure lead them to be bought for a year of service by a young farmer named Plunkett and his foster brother, Lyonel. The young men had no idea of the young women's nobility, which leads to some quite comic situations and even.... love.    
Larry Harriet, who offers the name of Martha to the farmers, is played one of Zürich's own, Michelle Chang. Her servant, Nancy, is played by Swiss Amanda Schweri. Young farmer, Plunkett, is played by Andreas Dick and his foster brother is BRITISH Charne Rochford. The talented musical director is American Kelly Thomas.   
The set is so realistic for England, as are the costumes simply divine. Although it is sung in German, the expressions and lively music shall guide any audience through the short four parts. Definitely worth seeing!   
Tonight, Nov. 29th, Sunday, Nov. 30th, Dec. 5th, Dec. 6th, Dec. 7th 
Then again on Jan. 25, Feb. 8th, Feb. 14th, Feb. 22, and Feb. 28           
The BRIT, Charne Rochford can't speak German, but he sounds quite convincing, as he sings! :-)
		 
			
			If you love THE LAST ROSE of SUMMER, you'll the music. Lady Harriet, Martha, and Lyonel sing a duet of it.   
Can't get it out of my head! Beautiful!
		 
			
			I heard there are tickets available, at the door. However, I would suggest phoning Ticketino first, before venturing downtown Zürich today.   
TICKETINO:0900 441 441
		                     
			
			Fortunately, not from modern day UK, but 18th CENTURY ENGLAND.    
The set and costume designers' abilities are impressive.  Can't imagine how they they painted such huge canvases with such realistic 3-D imagery, nor how they can be transported to the various venues.   
Anyway, I appreciate when good events are announced. Hope others do, as well.   
BTW....I have NO CONNECTION  to this production...

I'm going to the concert of Peter Gabriel at the Hallenstadion next Tuesday and I wondered if there are any englishforum'ers going. Maybe I could join your group or something, as I am going alone   That'd be cool!

			When: Friday 7th November at 12.30pm 
Where: The 'Kleinersaal', Basel Musik-Akademie (Leonhardstrasse 6) 
What: Beautiful and relaxing late-medieval German song, with some medieval harp and lute. Also a cheeky bit of yodelling, apparently.   
I will be singing and playing Gothic harp, alongside my talented colleagues from the Schola Cantorum (the Early Music school at the Musik-Akademie). The group is directed by Kathleen Dineen.    
Free entry (not even a collection), and the perfect lunchtime break if you can spare the time. I think our set is around an hour, although of course you can sneak away early if needs be. There's also a cafe in the school if you need to wake up again after our chilled-out programme...    
Hope to see some of you there!

Date: 20:00-23:00, 24th October 2014 
Location: Volkhaus Zurich     There is so much  to do in the little big city of Zurich. You can hear some great Celtic  music and Gaelic folk songs with Irish whiskey at its best. This Irish  folk concert provides a close experience with Irish music including the  Irish bagpipes which are different than the Scottish bagpipes. The Irish  folk music is wonderful.

			Copenhagen based Il Tempo Gigante, alias Rolf Hansen, creates an air of hushed intensity through a virtuosic and highly original use of loops, guitar and voice. His elegant spider web like compositions are imbued with melodic durability and stands out in their fascinating offbeat arrangements that gently, but determined, oppose every tendency to idealization. 
With a distinctive guitar playing style and epic lyrics he carries the listener into all kinds of human experience and theres often a presence on stage that makes a very thin line between sender and receiver.

			I have been to a few festivals and every one has been similar but different. 
As I have picked up some Paléo tickets I thought it would be interesting to understand what the atmosphere is at Paléo and if you peeps have any tips. 
Conversation starters:   
			
			Have a look here ..  
Live streaming of the crowd at the main stage..    
I haven't been (until Thurs) but everybody tells me it's 'how a festival should be done' . I'm meeting friends at the champagne bar of all places    
I use Nyon station daily and so far it's been busy but civilised, with loads of dodgy people selling tickets - I say dodgy both because they look dodgy! and also because tonight, Dodgy1 standing with a sign 'Selling tickets for tonight' .. Dodgy2 standing beside him 'Buying tickets for tonight'    
			
			I just took a peek at the webcam...    
So sad. I can only see   person really gettin' down.    
C'mon peeps.   
Git yo boogie on!
		 
			
			Hey I am searching for price ranges and it is not specified on the website. Where can I get them and what do prices look like roughly?
		    No prices because it sold out after 10 minutes of being on sale    
70chf per day basically. You can buy tickets outside, tons of people selling.   
I was there last night and i would say one visit is nowhere near enough if you want to see it all, it's huge!
		 
			
			What to expect.....a lot of mud!   
			
			Lots of people telling you how evil grains and pasta are, and that gluten is the work of the Devil.   
Or am I confusing this with the music festival?    
			
			Lovely and exhausting. 
....and a mud bath    
But then again.. Paléo without the rain ..wouldn't be Paléo       Thanks! Now I know for next time       you obviously havent been. the muddy parts get filled with bark mulch.

			So, those of you who attended, what was your impression ?   
I was a bit disappointed that Soundgarden started too early.  I walked inside a few min. early, and walked inside the seating area at exactly 8:00, the announced time.  They were already starting their second song.  : /   
Sabbath did not disappoint; I think they gave an excellent show.  I was a bit shocked at: 
1) How old Ozzy looks when he moves.  I know he's around 65, but I had never seen him live, and didn't expect to see him so...don't know...slow ? 
2) the fact that he sang ""Into the void"" completely off key.   
Still...loved the show.  Any other comments ?
		 
			
			Ozzy Osbourne is too commerical for me. He's a realityTV show man.   
I prefer newcomers in a small club (not Hallenstate).
		 
			
			Black Sabbath in a smaller bar would be nice! I wish I saw them. They kinda' invented something in the heavier music genre.
		    I saw Sabbath a few times in the 70s at middle-sized venues. Last time was their 10th Anniversary Tour in 1978. I considered them a bit past their prime at this point (I was anyway much more into punk/new wave by then) but caught them for sentimental reasons.   
The gig was at the Hammersmith Odeon and they were supported by a little-known band called Van Halen who were absolutely sensational and totally stole the show. Amazing night.   
Looking at the gigography, I notice that the next night's gig at the same venue was cancelled because of 'PA failure'. I think my ears are still ringing...    
			
			i liked the show but preferred the times where Ronnie James Dio was the lead singer...
		 
			
			Talkin' about preferences: After Ozzy left / was fired from Sabbath to team up with a guy called Randy Rhoads (R.I.P)...they made some excellent music too! I cannot get bored with the songs on Blizzard of Ozz, espcially songs like Crazy Train or Mr. Crowley! 
I think I know what I will be listening to this evening!   "	5		 Jun 0001	[]	Black Sabbath - 20th June @ Hallenstadion	guest		1918	Concerts

			Hello   
I bought my tickets for 2 days of zurich open air. 
However I read somewhere that you need your ID/passport to get there ?   
Is that just for safety issues ?  
I dont want to go on the 2nd day anymore and would like to know if I can give my tickets to someone else.
		    It's a two-day pass? They exchange the ticket for an armband the first day. Difficult to give to someone else.
		 
			
			thanks i will give my 2 day pass and buy one day only

			Johnny Clegg will be doing a concert in Geneva on Sunday at 21.30 in the Jardin Anglais.   
And it's free!!!  Part of the Fetes de Genève.
		 
			
			Too bad I live in the wrong part of CH    
			
			I must admit, i did an about turn.  I was checking out the concerts.  And there he was!!  Then i thought, perhaps it was some French play on words, no - they even had a picture of him on there!!   
I shall blow him a kiss for you!!!  Better get my African moves practice in, last time i saw him must be 25 years ago!!!  Or more.   
Arthritis has taken over a bit.....   
And for all the synics out there who were wanting a blow by blow account of the Jimmy Somerville concert last year, this one i am going to!!!
		 
			
			Johnny Clegg is ahhsom and a legend.
		 
			
			Thanks PatsyCat. How was the concert? And your dancing?   
			
			The concert was great, it was one of those days where it rained all day.  But luckily the rain stopped just before the concert.   
Not much dancing, too many people!!

			Just love to hear my neighbours and students, brother and sister Matthieu and Marie- play and sing together. On vid, aged, 13 and 15- now 2 years later they've both matured so much, and Marie's voice is so much stronger. Great kids. (dad on the keyboard). Matthieu got the chance to play several times with Steve Lukather ot Toto- first time when he was about 11- very lucky.       
			
			So good to here good musicians instead of the usual voice over all fur coat and no knickers commercial tripe.
		 
			
			Very talented!   
I remember Toto from my younger days, loved ""Africa "", ""Rosanna"" etc. Lucky boy!

			I have a spare ticket for the sold out Amy Macdonald gig in Schaffhausen tonight. Would anyone like to take it off my hands? CHF 80 face value. 
Thanks!
		 
			
			This event is now in progress - hope you sold the ticket - saw Birdy w/my daughter in Schaffhausen on Thursday. The setting was great, the audience a real let-down...not to mention all the smoke in the air NOT coming from the on-stage effect machines. The redeeming factor was catching Birdy and her band on our way out - if you are 15 yrs old having your artist t-shirt signed a pretty big deal.   
I have never been to an outdoors concert in CH, I NEVER expected smoking during the performances, but realise now that was naive...
		 
			
			Hey, thanks for the reply. I sold the ticket on the gate for ten francs less than face value, even though it was already a discounted ""early bird"" price, because I bought it on the day of issue back in about January. But hey, at least I got most of it back. And Birdy is supposed to be good. I was recommended to see her when she came to Lausanne earlier in the year, but I live in Zürich and just couldn't get back after the gig, or to work at a sensible hour the next day. 
I remember my first gig: Saxon at London Hammersmith Odeon in 1980 when I was 15. But I didn't get anything signed until 1988, and even that was a Scorpions your programme signed by Iron Maiden, who happened to be guests at the gig. So well done to your daughter :-)    
And yeah, the fact that the Swiss smoke all the time is disgusting :-/
		 
			
			Good job! That was a reasonable outcome/loss, and hopefully made someone happy. We were looking at the people watching/listening from their windows rather pleasantly surprised by the evening's entertainment.   
Funny how ""first gig"" memories stick - my daughter's was Birdy at the Forum (Kentish town) this last March - we worked our way to the front and had a great evening, more so because it is such a small venue and the audience was there for her and her band. We just missed her in Zürich last February (was happening the eve I found out and was sold-out, Lausanne as well) so I did some quick searching to see when we might catch her next. I really hope she is well-managed and doesn't get exploited as teen-star because she is truly talented and must find the on-the-road life a bit overwhelming at times. Birdy (17) is clearly younger than her band members, but one senses they really communicate through the music and have a good time. The cellist is awesome, the mellow tone that richens the bass and with different bow techniques adds to the rhythm is quite special. I highly recommend catching them live!   
Amy MacDonald and Birdy on the same evening would have made up for the smokers  But that is the tactics of programming.   
My first gig was Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes and Bruce S, one summer at the Jersey shore long ago...no autographs  "	3	0	 Mar 2007	['21', '9']	Ticket for sale for Amy Macdonald in Schaffhausen	martinreed	48	1325	Concerts

			Hi there!   
This is my first Streetparade in ZRH and I'd like to have some tips.    
I heard that it's something really crowded and crazy, and I would like to know which areas should I avoid and which are better and so on.    
Any ideas?
		 
			
			do what my gf did in january, and take monday the 4th off.
		 
			
			I would avoid all the areas highlighted in red. Have fun    
			
			Haha, ok, so, I cannot go out from home    
			
			According to this map street parade spreads like a virus! Glad I'm not living in any of the above infected kreises!
		    I actually do and the truth is I can hear it a bit when on the balcony but I see nothing with regards to people. For a bit more accurate info this map tells you areas that will definitely be affected    
As a general rule of thumb avoiding areas on the map and the area between the HB and the lake will keep you away from the crowds and limit the noise.
		 
			
			What is the actual date of the Street Parade this year?
		 
			
			Saturday the 2nd of August - directly after the Swiss National Holiday.
		    This will be my 7th one I have been to. Normally we start at about 9/10am, and go thru the whole parade with ambitions to go thru the night. Not once have I not passed out somewhere for atleast an hour or two. It's good, but this year I am going to make more of an effort to stay by a stage then watching a self loathing float pass me by.      
Music doesn't stay long enough, and it gets boring fast how many girls feel like they have to take it up a notch and kiss each other for the crowd.
		    That can   get boring?        I think you know what I mean. In my world it does. When it is real it is awesome. When it is for show it is lame. And it's not why I am at Street Parade, nor any city sanctioned rave. Or the like. It's to get outside, with a lot of nice people, and have a good time. If we all stop and stare at something for 10 hours, damn, I could do that at home.
		 
			
			Too much Flouro spandex and silicon boobs and Euro house music for me to enjoy. I will be away happily  . Although the following week is the Werdinsel Openair that's a small free festival should be quite nice and relaxed.
		 
			
			Nothing really to be afraid of. Yes people get crazy and yes there are some fights. But overall it's just a lot of people gathering to have fun. You might love it or hate it, just go out there and see it yourself.
		    Nah, my wife who is working in Zurich this morning, also sent for reconnaissance, she will be able to tell me    
			
			We went into zurich last year for something else, oblivious as usual. The train was packed full of very amusing people, it was a big party. Except when a group of rather tipsy boys pulled the emergency stop on the train right before the airport. Then it became hot and annoying.    
We had no trouble going away from the HB in the opposite direction and getting back to the HB and home.
		 
			
			Giving it a miss this year...
		       
Would be nice if everybody did.
		       
			
			Correction, may go and do some photo-shooting. After all, I may as well check out all this disgraceful girl-on-girl behaviour to remind myself how cheap and degrading it is.
		    Please do so and post a few of them here afterwards. I'm curious what's like anyway because I haven't been to one myself yet and most probably wouldn't pass the dress code requirement anyway    
			
			According to the newspaper, the organizers promised to stop the music when passing next to the zoo  as some rare bird is nesting at the moment, and the bass could make the eggs hatch prematurely!       So I heard. It might be not so cool afterwards ...       
			
			i witnessed the extreme end of fag..booze...music...dance and love yesterday.....the occasion was Street Parade,Zurich 2014. 
the enjoyment and ecstasy reached at its pinnacle and the peace also prevailed. It was really awesome to see people dressed in the colorful costumes..and some even without  ...it sets a great example of love, peace and merriment...the trucks with big speakers and DJ's playing their best piece mdae the crowed to hake their booty...it was a complete fun filled... 
Though my shoes were sticking to the road due to all the booze around...but no complaints...parade was worth a walk...   
Check few pics in Photo aLBUM:     
			
			I totally agree. And for Zurich which is such a quiet place having a big party like that is unique!!!
		 
			
			Well I went and got some great shots of my friends and some randoms. As usual, it was all very merry in the afternoon and then the tone started to change a little when it got to 6pm, and some people were starting to get a bit rowdy. I could have throttled the arseholes who suddenly think it's a great idea to start flinging beer everywhere. The ground surrounding the stages was also literally covered in broken glass, so really and genuinely dangerous if you're weren't wearing footwear with thick soles, or if you happened to fall over... I'm talking big jagged shards of glass. Everywhere. Luckily I didn't see any accidents of that sort, just the usual people comatose on the side of the street or being tended to by ambulance staff.   
Still, a good laugh, but I'm glad I didn't stay until after dark this time, as I bet that was absolute carnage.
		    what a nice little dino        Yes, they did and the revellers joined in by turning off the loudspeakers and even singing happy birthday to the new little ones as they passed by.        
Who says you can't have fun and be considerate at the same time.

			Not a concert as such, but Pathé cinema at Dietlikon are showing a transmission of the Monty Python reunion gig this Sunday. They might be showing at their other cinemas around CH as well, but you'll have to check the link. Pretty sure I'll be heading up there Sunday, if anyone else wants to join up, drop me a line          It's also going out live on Gold, if you have a Sky satellite/subscription.
		 
			
			I have a spare ticket for this show and it's free.    
If anyone wants to come drop me a PM. We can meet at the cinema at 7.30 or at the Viadukt about 6.30 (for a beer), we'll be driving up (and back after).

			My daughter and I would like to go to a festival-type event this summer, and are particularly interested in catching Birdy.   
Does anyone have any comments/recommendations pertinent to either Stars In Town (Schaffhausen) or Heitere (Zofingen)? Has anyone been before - is either venue better than the either, assuming it is first-come first-serve standing?    
(The distance/cost are not hugely different)
		 
			
			Stars in town is similar to other festivals direct in the city (like the ones in Winterthur or Lörrach, with just around 8000-10000 attendees) with no camping, because it is  in  the heart of the city. 
Heitere Open Air in Zofingen is like a real festival with camping, but really small compared to greenfield or open Air St:Gallen/Zurich open Air. Attendees will be around 8000-10000 . 
Both Open airs have good acces with public transport , so the decision have to be done by the Line UP.....
		 
			
			Thanks Blackbird - Heitere is probably better value for money if one is interested in any of the other bands, and the atmosphere etc. But smaller (Stars) also nice - if only one could predict the weather   
			
			There is no bad weather for an open air, there is only  incorrect wardrobe, even 
when it rains cats and dogs. 
I don't like covered in mud, but if it is only rain, take a poncho and you will be fine or if the sun is shining use a lot of sunblocker (SPF 50)
		 
			
			heiterre is a decent little festival its small but i've never found any problems with it being overly crowded or anything so it makes for a decent chilled atmosphere.. if you're ever looking for a small festival feel good fest in nidergösgen near aarau is good. its mostly swiss artists but really nice friendly atmosphere.

			Hi all,   
If you live in Basel and enjoy classical/jazz you might want to check out these afternoon and evening concerts by this little foundation Swiss Vocal Arts. They put on   concerts every other Thursday lunch time with performances from students from the local Fachhochschule (music college). There's usually a small but very international audience and there're nibbles afterwards. Definitely a good place to meet people. They also put on evening concerts every couple of months. I attended one the other week and the musicians were really impressive.   
The next concert is next Thursday:

			Any open mic performances or concerts where any who wants can sing or whatever if they ask? Someone told me there is a place in basel, in kleinbasel by claraplatz where there's an open mic performance on monday's, i think the place is called kaserne. i dont believe it because i went to kaserne website and it had a calendar of people who are scheduled to perform so that leads me to believe that i cant perform because there's already a known band who got invited so it's there show. I want to know where i can perform and what day and time to perform in basel. Is it free for people to get in? Im inviting people to see me perform.
		    You're in luck!  Tomorrow night is   with WEE DJ!
		    If it's a 'known band', then they're unlikely to be playing the whole evening.   
Go anyway. Watch. Learn. Enjoy.    
			
			maybe you could try joining the meetup group for Basel/Zurich music makers?   
I guess there are other members on here, as that's how I found the group. There are various meets/events organised, and you can even make your own and invite people to it if there are no events planned for your interest. I am almost certain I recall seeing an open mic night organised a few months ago etc.
		 
			
			Maybe you mean  ? It's part of the Kaserne complex and they have an open jam session every Monday if jazz is your thing. They also do an open mic for singer-songwriters a few times a year; anyone is welcome to perform as long as the material is original. Sud also does an   which has a broader focus (stand up comedy, magic, caberet, etc).
		 
			
			The Sudhaus has an open stage night on the last Sunday of each month. It is quite fun. I got up and did something last year. It was quite fun.      
Contact   to register in advance. He is a nice guy and he speaks English. He does magic and introduces the acts. You could win a small prize if the audience like you. They have a clapometer.   
Best of luck

			From May 8 through June 11, many Zurich choirs will be performing for free in backyards all over town.   
Here is a program:    
In case you are looking to join a choir (which I can highly recommend if you want to meet people), this would be a great and uncomplicated way to check choirs out. Most choirs (including the one I sing in) always look for good new singers, in particular men (no this is not sexist, it just happens to be the case that most choirs have at least twice as many women as men).
		 
			
			Thanks, much appreciated.   
I will definitely be attending some of the events.

			Martin Medeski & Wood w/ Nels Cline @ the Auditorio Stelio Molo in Lugano   
Saw - or the better word is probably ""witnessed"" - a great performance by the aforementioned trio + guest (Cline). 
I had seen them some years ago in Piazza Riforma w/ John Scofield, another of my favourite guittplayers. 
I do remember the improvs, very funky, jazzy, there was a great mood in the whole piazza. 
But last night, boy, it was different. 
We're talking about a bunch of grownups   intent in making some very happy and disturbing noises - Mr Cline having delighted my ears & soul with his loopy extravaganza of layered, reversed and pitched guitar phrases. His ""jazz"" solos were tinged with the muted, nasal, peaky tones of a scratchy wha-wha pedal; his arpeggios sounded clean and crisp - almost hinting at another of my favourite plankspankers, Mr. Bill Frisell. Nels Cline also delighted in spanking his modded Fender Jaguar's strings with what appeared to be some kind of ¿ toothbrush ?, creating wonderful strata of sheer white / pink /rainbow noise. 
The sonic assault lasted   for something like 60 minutes, before MMW regaled us with an appreciated encore.   
I was left with the impression that this is what Hendrix would be playing today, if he were still among us... which is to say that this was a major kick arse concert    
I overheard some english being spoken just before the sonic mayhem erupted, hope some of you EF'fing music lovers made it to the venue!   
Ciao   
Paul 
p.s. it appears that the next dates are either in Milano, Italy or in Poland and Norway and the in the USA...      
			
			Yes! Nels Cline is a long time trippy guitarist from Los Angeles. 
I'm sure you know he is the guitarist and band member many years now in the band Wilco...   
Both Nels and his talented brother drummer,percussionist  Alex Cline used to be heavily influenced by Frank Zappa in Los Angeles;and used to play together a lot in the little avant-guard scene.   
Alex has performed in Switzerland as well,and is also featured on some CDs with an old friend,band mate of mine John Wolf  Brennan, an amazing tasty composer Swiss/Irish pianist,organist,melodica player;based out of Weggis Switzerland. 
(I was the guitarist with his brother Peter Wolf in the Swiss progressive rock band called Flame Dream)   
That for suresy must have been a mega ahhsome performance Paul !

			Hi,   
Was checking out the Zurich opera house website and came across this. Seems to be a interesting line up. Different programs from 22 to 27 April for the opening of Sechseläutenplatz. A movie on Paul Potts, Circus, Boog Shoot, Concerts (Bryn Terfel) etc

			Hey there, does anyone know how to obtain cheap opera tickets in Zurich? 
Thank you!
		 
			
			Occasionally the cinemas show an opera in 3D which I found very acceptable.
		 
			
			Yes, sure:       
Tickets from CHF 15 to 70. Only available one month before and you will have to be fast to get the best tickets.
		 
			
			Anything on the horizon, oh horned one?          Thanks for the link: The best tickets that I can see are for middle of the 2014 and they cost 35 CHF. Not bad, but where do you find the 15 CHF, I think a couple of hours after it's in the web.    
			
			Be a student. Huge discounts every night at the box office, a CHF 200 seat will cost you CHF 20 only.      PS: The Kulturlegi is for poor income people.         super... I find it fair.  
But I am not a student anymore.
		 
			
			Please also be mindful that you be also be looking at the performance from behind a column or a railing.   
It is too bad there are no ""last minute discount"" kiosks like Place des Ternes in Paris or Leicester Square in London.  We were at the Faust opera last friday and there were still many empty seats...   
Maybe a good business idea to start...
		 
			
			Great discount for concerts in Zurich!          You are entirely correct for the absolute cheapest category. The second-lowest, however, has been quite OK in my experience.
		 
			
			I might be worth to have a look at Groupon. Offers could pop up there.
		     
Agreed, this is what we did as well.
		 
			
			I recently purchased discounted tickets for Jenufa. They were not the super discounts  but the AMAG People's Performances, had 2nd row seats for CHF 75, purchased a few days before the Dec. 4th opera. What a treat! Opera was fantastic.
		 
			
			Does anyone know how many seats a student is allowed to purchase and are they permitted to buy a ticket for a non-student to go along with them?
		     
According to   everybody has to show a student identity card when purchasing the reduced tickets and again when entering the building. This, however, is only enforced spottily and I myself have several times purchased reduced tickets for other people and they never had to show their student cards when attending. But of course there' always Murphy's Law, so be careful.    
			
			I'd be down to go with someone sometime!
		 
			
			Will research upcoming operas & discounts (when would tickets be released for summertime?); I'm thinking of heading to Vienna, too, for an opera trip...
		    Vienna wwould be nice... recommended !
		 
			
			Or buy cheapest ticket category to the opernhaus for mid-week performances and then hope to switch seats during the interval (a Swiss friend confirmed that this was socially acceptable   ) - mid-week best as a lot of people with subscriptions don't turn up.   
As an aside, not all 35chf category tickets have a bad view... just don't get the furthest rows at the back nor the extreme edges and you should be fine!

			The very talented American-Canadian singer and song writer is coming to Zurich for one concert @ the Zurich Volkshouse             
			
			Thanks! I might even cross Schweiz to hear him. Any idea what kind of set he will play? He's such a versatile little b*stard. I love his remake of Judy Garland's concert & his contributions to the McGariggle's albums.   
PS Possible repost - I saw his father (Loudon Wainwright III) in concert in 1971. He's much funnier, but doesn't sing as well.
		 
			
			as far as I know, he is now on a tour titled ""the best of..."", so hopefully we will get a taste of all his recordings and albums.  
I saw him in Tel-Aviv few years ago, and his guest star was his mother (I think it was few months before she past away). 
Then I saw his sister Martha in the documentary ""I'm your man"":       
And in Zurich he will be performing with his other sister- Lucy! 
What a talented family, really amazing.
		 
			
			Got tickets for this - can't wait!   
Loved the last set he did in Zurich. The audience was under strict instructions not to applaud between pieces or after the set (before the break) and he came shuffling on stage like he was attending a funeral wearing the most absurdly over the top cap.   
He's so melodramatic    
I'm hoping as he's just released a 'greatest hits' that he might be covering some of his older repertoire. I'd like to hear some of his older stuff again from Poses.

			Is anyone from this forum going?
		 
			
			I will pass this time.    
I will never forget the Sepultura concert I went to in the early 90s!!            Ah, during the Arise era!   
I never got to see them during their heyday unfortunately, but I do like their recent albums.
		 
			
			I saw them in '94, I believe, in New York and met Igor wandering outside before the concert! I believe only one original member is still in the group. I wouldn't call the current line up Sepultura!
		    Yeah, only, Paulo Jr. (bass player) is an original member, although Andreas Kisser (guitar player) played in all the classic albums except on the first one.   
I agree, that I wouldn't call this line up Sepultura without Max and Igor, but it is a strong brand!

			Hi there,    
I just want to know which is the best way to find concerts or music activities in Zurich.    
Thanks.
		 
			
			usgang.ch       awesome.. thanks a lot ...    
			
			I personally use stagend.com for gigs around switzerland  
cheers
		 
			
			As well as Usgang, I check the sites for the various venues in town:   
Zukunft -    
Exil -    
Hafenkneipe -    
Komplex -    
Helsinki -    
Papiersaal -    
Plaza -    
Mascotte -    
Also, promoters, e.g.       
Also sign up with Bands In Town:    
Also, Zueritipp is sometimes helpful:    
On Twitter, follow @highrotational and @bm_zuerich Free tickets sometimes!   
High Rotation's blog is here as well:    
If you PM me, I'll send you my Twitter handle as well . . . I sometimes tweet gig info.
		 
			
			I always look at:    
			
			Try   or petzitickets.ch aswell. 
For infomation about the upcoming festivals look at:       
			
			I just found the app bandsintown. It's been very useful.
		 
			
			Be very careful where you order tickets from.    
A friend of mine was scammed out of Euros  280   He used   and paid by Swiss credit card, who are refusing to refund him...    
some good reviews      
and some bad reviews       Which card company is this?
		 
			
			Look here for any type of music in any region        
And also here for classical music in the Basel region:      
			
			Try the songkick app.   
Super easy to use and you wont miss anything if you set up your library right.   
Essentially you set up the bands you like based on your preferences...it continuously updates concert info based on your location preferences.    
its slick.  try it out.
		 
			
			And if you are into heavy stuff you can follow these guys, either website/blog or Facebook page, they regularly organise smaller and more chilled out gigs mainly in Zurich and Olten, really good bands         
			
			songkick! all you need.
		 
			
			I love for years Steffen Hung's    
Steffen has ahhsome interviews too.
		     
There is possibility to find the calendar of Opera/concert of classical music (Zurich/Luzern/Zug area) as well? 
Ths in advance! 
Monika
		    Agreed, songkick is awesome!
		 
			
			just loaded songkick, its very good thanks
		 
			
			Many thanks Caroline! 
Just loaded, it's awesome    
			
			Great thanks! I'll give it a try and i hope it has some local musos and jam sessions listed as well.
		 
			
			And there is also this page:   if you want to see some contemporary music, I find it very useful.
		 
			
			Thank you very much!

			I got engaged about a week or so ago and my Fiance heard about this event running this weekend, which is perfect timing.    
Anyone been to one of these or are planning on going? Is anybody exhibiting something this year?
		 
			
			Congrats!   
It is good to get a feel of what is offered for a wedding but it can be overwhealming. Bit like going to Ikea without having a plan    
I exhibited last year with my wedding shop  . I am also a wedding photographer but never exhibited    
Enjoy!
		 
			
			Congrats on getting engaged! 
Their are a few wedding fairs going on - wedding season! The fair is a little overwhelming, if you are planning to go, go early as it is not too busy. It will give you some good ideas, and its nice to do with your future partner. All the exhibitors can be found on line, in the red book, wedding guide has a good app.  
Best thing is go with a little plan, location, numbers and budget - weddings can be super expensive and suddenly your getting stressed about the tiniest details! Swiss weddings are slightly different, I have girl saying they are having huge weddings, and they have 40 people for dinner - few have dancing, but they spend money on bands -          
If your looking for a designer wedding dress, I have a great collection of secondhand and new wedding dresses.                
Go with your future husband, have fun, try all freebies, if you go last thing on Sunday the exhibitors want to give everything away!      
The fashion shows are fun - and its also good to look at the stands when the fashion show is going on, so their are less people! It gets very hot, so take a bottle of water and a bag to put all the flyers you get!
		 
			
			Thanks that's really insightful! Yeah when I saw it was going to be in Hallenstadion, I figured that it would be quite big and daunting.    
Actually the church, dress and venue have been sorted. The rest is still to do  .      
Do you know if the tickets allow you to come on both days or whether you have to choose one?
		 
			
			Congratulations on getting engaged! Run with your future spouse, have a ton of fun.

			I was considering going to Circus Monti with my husband for an evening show.  Does anyone have any opinions of the show?  My husband doesn't speak German - would he have much trouble enjoying the show?  Thanks    
			
			I wouldn't think so.  So far as I know Monti is a traditional circus so acrobats, ariel artists, jugglers, tumblers, animal acts, that sort of thing which is visual not verbal.  He might struggle a little if the clowns are fairly talkative, but I've never found it to be a problem when I've gone to see Circus Knie and Nock.  It's very rare for a clown act to rely heavily on speech so even if he misses the fine details he should get the gist of what's going on and join in the laughter.
		 
			
			I stayed two weeks ago and It was amazing!
		 
			
			Hi,     
         We are thinking of going to the circus but wanted to know whether I can take my 2 year old kid. Any experiences with the small kids.

			My husband took our 9 and 4 yrs old daughters - he said the show was a bit too long for the younger one - she was getting restless the last half an hour - so a two year old might be a little risky...
		 
			
			I went to an evening performance at Circus Monti in Aarau a few weeks ago.   
I was a bit reluctant to go (fear of stray elephants and creepy clowns) but had such a positive experience that I wanted to let others know about it.   
There are no animals in Circus Monti- purely acrobatics and physical feats.     
It is traditional in the sense that there are no postmodern elements- it's classic, wholesome and wondrous.  The narrative is entertaining and whimsical without veering into the dark and disturbing.   
There is a 'buffet tent' that serves crepes, popcorn, and cotton candy, as well as having a full bar.   
We sat in the last row of benches 'the blue section' (~30chf).  The tent was intimate in size so all the seats were good.     
All in all, a highly recommended experience!
		 
			
			I was just going to ask about animals. My husband had thought we should take our little one but I didn't want to go if there were elephants or other animals. I just don't personally agree with animals ""performing.""
		    They since 2011 no longer have animals with them
		 
			
			We love Circus Monti and go every year. The performers are a mixture of the Muntwyler family and seasonal guests from all over the world. It's a very personal circus, the performers are milling around outside and in the food tent before the show and during the interval, and the tent is the right size to provide spectacle and allow the performance to still feel intimate.    
There's a segment in this year's show where Mr Muntwyler spins plates, supported by the entire cast which to me is the most perfect circus act I've ever seen. Wonderful balance of humour, slapstick, tension and skill and you can tell the whole team are having a blast.   
We traditionally go on my daughter's birthday. When she was 2 she sat amazed through the whole thing, and finished standing on my lap clapping along to the music. On her third birthday she was quite restless and playing around in front of the seats. That's 3 year old's for you    
But please go. As others have said there are no animals, which is why we choose Monti, and they have such warmth and tradition that they are so worth supporting and keeping going. I read that family circuses in Switzerland are struggling, with arts grants being cut for circus performances - so it's good to support them.
		 
			
			I have been with two little girls to Circus Monti and Circus Nock, and they liked Monti a lot more, so I can recommend it as well    
			
			Well...   
The Circus Monti is in town in Luzern at the moment and I am considering going.        
Is anyone else planning on going or have you been before?    
Kind regards,    
Charde

			Motorhead are due to play the Hallenstadion on November 7th.     
Hopefully, Lemmy's health will have improved by then and he can play the whole gig.  He had to leave the stage at the Wacken Festival yesterday after just six numbers.       
			
			That's a shame that he didn't do a full show. Guy's getting old I guess. Anyway I already have my tickets for that show!
		 
			
			These are the first three of the six songs that he did play       
Statement from Motorhead:       
			
			Lets hope that he is ok soon....the guy is a legend..

			Anyone heading to the Fat Freddy's Drop concert on Saturday?? - tickets still available!     
...and more specifically is anyone driving from Fribourg?? 
I have been toying with the idea of going - but have two issues to resolve:   
1. I am only a few weeks out from the due date for my first baby ..... (they do have seated tickets available, but no one seems to be able to tell me if it is a good idea or not).   
2. Getting home to Fribourg is a bit tricky afterwards....more so when you add in point 1
		 
			
			Interesting! Thanks for the tip. I have one or two of their tunes on the late Charlie Gillett's annual World Music compilations. However if I do make it, I'll be coming from the opposite direction.   
Have you already seen them live?
		 
			
			Technically never seen them live - as I'm guessing streaming their live album release concert through youtube while working probably doesn't count - but have heard great things about their concerts.   
Prefer their early work to their new stuff, but still really enjoy listening.   
Surprised that there are still tickets left as so many of their tour dates in Europe have sold out.   
They are also playing in Zurich on Monday 21st....tickets still available for that one too.

I normally buy tickets from here:       
Or in this case from the Kaufleuten site:     
			
			There is no official ticketsale for the ""Showcase"". 
You can win tickets either through 20minutes, Kaufleuten and probably samsung:       
			
			ohhhhh ((( 
thanks a lot!

Date: 20:00-23:00, 25th October 2013 
Location: Volkhaus Zurich     There is so much to do in the “little big city” of Zurich. You can hear some great Celtic music and Gaelic folk songs with Irish whiskey at its best. This Irish folk concert provides a close experience with Irish music including the Irish bagpipes which are different than the Scottish bagpipes. The Irish folk music is wonderful. Musically, the old Gaelic songs sound elvishly lovely -- to me like a song far over the horizon.     Here's information on concert in Irish Folk Festival Zurich 2013.     The concert: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWLjhXXr68E   Die besten Künstler der traditionellen keltischen Musik!

Tickets: Please buy your tickets by using the following links.

Meeting point: Let's meet at the entrance hall of Volkhaus at 19:20. And for those who arrive late, please find us nearby the whiskey bar inside the Volkhaus. We may opt to begin drinking before the concert.     So, enjoy a delightful concert of Irish folk music in Volkhaus. Don’t miss this special opportunity for a concert featuring the most beloved Irish folk singers. Please reserve your tickets soon!     I may cancel this event if there is no response or if sign up rate continues to be poor…   
			
			This sounds interesting   given that they are not many tickets left: which category did you book and where will you be sitting? have to check with some friends but I would be in. Will get back to you.
		 
			
			Lunasa is a great Irish band!!!     
And Karen Casey is just down to Earth with her beautiful elvish voice !!

			Hi guys. I too asked the same question when I arrived in Vaud. I am surprised no-one has pointed you in the direction of the Ecole de Jazz et de Musique Actuelle (EJMA) in Lausanne Flon. They turn their foyer into a decent little bar and do excellent jam nights often involving the pro teachers and often entrance is free:  . I have been a few times and it is top notch.

			Hello music friends in Basel!    
The Münsterkantorei Basel is a concert choir affiliated to the beautiful  Basel Minster and conducted by Annedore Neufeld, a very virtuous,  enthusiastic and highly professional lady. About 50 singers work on high  level sacred music from all epochs, a capella and with an orchestra.  
Rehearsals are usually on Wednesday night at the Bischofshof, right next to the Basel Minster.      . Some german knowledge is required for understandig the conductor   (understanding ""german german"" should do)   
On Wednesday, 4th of September, we will start rehearsing Bach's famous Christmas Oratorio (all six parts).  
Concerts will be on Dec 21 and 22 at the Basel Minster.   
If you are interested in joining this once in a lifetime experience  don't hesitate to contact me or just come to the  Bischofshof (address:  Rittergasse 1, Basel) at 7:30 pm on Wed 4th of September  (or any other  Wednesday). 
Especially people with some singing experience under age 50 and men are needed!

			Excellent! I don't particularly like his music but I have to say he is a great entertainer, concert was brilliant.          Concert was indeed fantastic, even more special as my daughter (Molly a.k.a. Polly was made to feel like a superstar, we are still on cloud 9 this experience is a memory we will treasure forever!   
Here is a video clip of Robbie talking to my daughter        
			
			not sure if the clip worked first time       
			
			also this one you can at the 5 min stage you can see Robbie getting us up on stage, still can't believe this happened so surreal but amazing!       
			
			Wow that was you! That was fantastic
		 
			
			Wow!    
How close were you?  From the first clip it seems like you are right infront of him.   
Edit: just watched second clip .. what a pair of rock chicks you are!
		 
			
			Yep that was us. fantastic!!!   
We were at the front, a friend had been keeping a space near the front but a girl from St Gallen turn round realising how small my daughter was and that would be difficult for her to see unless she was on our shoulders all night, said we could stand with her!!    
Honestly this was the best day of our lives, totally wonderful time and he was such a nice guy too, love him more now haha
		 
			
			Did you get to meet him after as you went backstage afterwards if I remember rightly?
		 
			
			No unfortunately not, but he was so nice and kept asking if we were ok as we watched the fireworks together, as we came off the stage we were handed his plectrum he used that night and the drummer came up and gave us his drumsticks too!!  Was so overwhelmed and still are a bit!! haha
		 
			
			That's fantastic, certainly something to cherish. 
 It certainly brought a smile to the crowd and was very funny when he's was apologising or his bad language.
		 
			
			yeah and saying it was only Uncle Robbie!! how fab!¨   
she was also on SRF3 yesterday as they contacted us and asked if they could interview her live on air......topped off the weekend nicely!       
			
			polly and mum were superstars on friday. I was there. well done both.
		     
Thank you, we certainly felt like stars, was a great feeling, although Molly took it in her stride I was completely starstruck and shaking like a leaf!    
			
			Wow Glenda! That was you?!   
Must admit I was a tad jealous of you both.     
Your little Molly is a cutiepie!
		 
			
			To Glenda and Molly 
You were fantastic up there! So relaxed! Thank you for posting the links!     I bet Dave from Mexico wouldn't have been so comfortable on stage         Thanks guys, yes that was us.  We were chuffed to bits to just be at the front in the first place and then for him to keep smiling over at her was amazing little did we know how the evening would pan out!  The can of pepsi has pride of place!! Just brilliant!    
			
			How amazing for you! 
I really like Robbie and his music, you are lucky girls just to have been at the concert, but to have spoken to him, got on stage, well, just, wow!
		    This is exactly how we feel!! as you say, just, WOW!!       I   Scottish accents and that's no Scottish accent, Miss Moneypenny.  That's an accent from deepest, darkest Argovia!   
He's a funny lad, our Robbie    
			
			That is soooooooooooooooooo cool    
Something that you will remember for a very very long time.......Robbie is the man       Yep when Molly speaks swiss german it is definitely a local Aarau area twang!  But her Scottish still has the Fife twang too, its great!    
			
			Wow - until now, I merely regretted not going. Now I'm totally mortified. What a great experience for you and your daughter, and so cool to have it on video!
		 
			
			Wow! Amazing!!  
I was going to take my 10 yrs old but I wasn't sure, because of the crowd. Now I'm regretting it!  
Congrats to Molly and Mum!
		    Awww you should have, don't hesitate the next time, this was my daughters first standing concert and she loved being at the front....that would have been enough, but little did we know what would happen next....just amazing!!!!    
			
			Wow wow wow!!   
That made my evening!!!

			Hi all!   
 Since last month I have been looking for tickets for Bruno Mars´ concert next October but in ticketcorner.com says ""tickets currently not available"". I thought that maybe at that time they were not selling the tickets for an specific reason but the announcement continues so I am not sure if it is because there are no more tickets.      
Does anyone know if it means that the tickets are sold out? I understand that if the tickets are sold out they would say that, right?     
Thanks
		    tickets went on sale March 1, so they're sold out.    
			
			There are some available, but be careful they are not scammers!!!

			Hi all,      
I was wondering if anyone fancies going to see Maximo park on Friday 19th July, it is part of the stimmen festival in Basel and is 34 Swiss per ticket...  Having seen maximo park at gladtonbury a few years back they are excellent live...          
Olly
		 
			
			Stimmen is in Lörrach, so it'll be €34.    
But still.
		 
			
			Seen them four times now and can heartily recommend them - really entertaining live.                  New Olly,   
You don't half get about mate. As for gyms, I'm at Indigo fitness its other side of the water from claraplatz. There is one called Migros fitness near you which is a lot cheaper.   
I'd be well up for Maximo, their lead singer Paul Smith lived round the corner from me in Billingham, so wouldn't mind seeing hearing a good old Teesside accent.   
Hope you enjoyed Pickwicks the other night lad,   
Dan

			Hey guys, 
      As you might have noticed posters for the offbeat Basel Jazz  festival has been put up at different places in the City. Being a Jazz  enthusiast   I want to attend some of the shows. So I was wondering if  there are others with similar inclinations hoping to go to some of the shows. I  am thinking of attending Madeleine Peyroux (Blues/Jazz), Roberto Foncesca (afro-cuban Jazz) and Trilok Gurtu (Indian Jazz). Tickets are available at ticketcorner for 35-40CHF ( ). Anybody interested in coming? Also, I am open to going to any of the other shows which are part of the concert. Hope lots of people turn up. PM me if this seems agreeable.    
Ciao!

I can no longer go to the Zürich gig on 30th June, so am considering going to the Stuttgart one. I would prefer to return tonight, rather than stay over, but the last train back to Zürich leaves Bad Cannstadt at 22:11, and the gig will certainly still be going on at that time.   
If anyone happens to be going, please let me know, and I'll share transport costs.

			It is know that during the second world war american Gi's brough Jazz to Paris Italy and West Germany. Today, Paris, Frankfort & Roma are good places for Jazz.    
However, Jazz is very strong in Switzerland with Montreux & the Basel jazz festival, Jazz school & jams. There are also many hotels were they play Jazz.    
I wonder why Jazz is so popular in Switzerland since there were no american presence after the second world war.
		 
			
			Jazz was played in Switzerland after WWI when american tourists startet to come for holidays and wanted to listen and dance to modern music. First swiss jazz bands where founded in the early 1920's. At this time almost every band including a sax and drums was called a jazz band.   
There is a documentary in 3 parts about the history of Jazz in Switzerland (in German):          After WW-ONE Jazz got into Continental Europe via Paris and Berlin. Towards the end plus after WW-TWO, US officers on one-week, two-weeks and three-weeks leave preferred Switzerland over Germany, not only as Germany of course was badly destroyed but also because the Swiss were USA-friendly. There for example was a hotel in Montreaux which was mostly filled with USA officers and their ballroom having jazz played. In Zürich, Jazz expanded in the 1960ies, mostly in private homes but also in localities like the Casa Bar and local Jazz Bands like the Piccadilly Six
		     
Interesting is to see in old videos of Chuck Berry to what extent his Rock nRoll Band used the same instruments and the same set up as Jazz Groups.

			Last weekend I went to a great festival in upstate NY called Mountain Jam - 4 days of camping, amazing music, partying, and hiking/exploring when the weather was nice.   
I am looking for something similar in Switzerland, and have come across these three big ones. Has anyone had experience with these that they would like to share? How big are they, do they allow you to put up your tent anywhere, etc? Any input is appreciated!
		 
			
			I went to several open air festivals in Switzerland a few years back and had a great time at them all. There are designated camping areas and depending on time of arrival you can be closer or farther from the festival itself- but even the farthest site wasn't far in my opinion.  Many of these are in the mountains so its a beautiful setting to enjoy in addition to the festival fun.  They seem to get larger every year but there are expected numbers on the respective websites.  I would highly recommend, however, they do sell out quickly and many have no more tickets available for this year.  If you have any specific questions feel free to PM me.

			Even though played in German it is going to be a big show.       
The open-air performance in the forecourt of the impressive Einsiedeln Benedictine monastery will take place from 21 June to 7 September with 600 people being involved in the theater production.   
""Taking up the tradition of the medieval mysterious plays,    by the Spanish writer Calderón de la Barca (1600 - 1681) was for the  first time performed in 1924 on the abbey square by the population of  Einsiedeln. Since then, the play has been staged every five years or so;  the last time in 2007.""   
It is a short, action-packed play in which entire lifespans of a  society  from king to beggar, rich merchant to peasant, are explored. God here is the omnipotent director, who appoints his stage manager,  The World, and selects his players and their roles (not individuals,  but archetypes). Then, in line with the doctrine of free will, he pushes  them on stage. From the cradle to the grave, theyre free to chart  their own choices; only then will the Supreme Being intervene again to  decide their ultimate fates.

		    ahhhh... i think i'm more scared by the possibility of mellowness   
			
			fer real. my buddy broke an arm, some earned black eyes, and I took on many bruises. all because punk rock chicks were the cutest.... but the was the 80s., i cant imagine swissies going that hard.
		 
			
			I've seen Henry Rollins at one of his ""spoken word"" shows before. He was great. He was also pretty good on one season of Sons of Anarchy.    
Dan
		    If you need a place to stay my flat is always open to EFrs from other parts of Switzerland.
		    You lucky git. I would love to see Rollins. It isn't fair that one man has so many talents. I hate  him. Just don't tell him I told you so!
		         
			
			Concert starts at 20:00 in the main Dynamo (the only man from the original Black flag will be Greg Ginn), same day there at the werk 21 there is another  
concert from a ""Punk/Hardcore"" Band, The Story so far , so don't be surprised 
if some 16to20 something will show up.

			The Schuur in Luzern is about 5 mins from the station. 
The is one Train at 23.35 to zurich (non Stop) and one at 23.54 (change at olten). Concert will be finished at 23.00, so there is a lot of time to make the train
		 
			
			It's scheduled to finish at 00:30. Do you have insider info?
		 
			
			No, but I have been there to a concert of seether, scheduled finish was also 
00:30, the Gig finished at 23:15, so I got plenty of time to make the train at 23:35. 
The Bar is open until 00:30 , aswell the cloakroom 
And on one side of the stage there is a pretty big clock, to let all people know, how much time is left

			Does anyone who has been to a concert in Schüür know if there is a seating/disabled area? I really want to see Frank Turner, I've followed him for years but I am currently walking with crutches and don't think I'll be able to stand all night. I will call the venue to check but was just wondering if anyone else who has been there knows anything about this?
		 
			
			There  are no ""offical"" seats , the concerts take place in the first floor, only stairs to get there, probably by the lift they use to get the equipment in ?
		 
			
			Support are "" Them fleurs"" starting at 8pm, Frank Turner starts at 9PM, so 
you got a limit of 2.5 hours to make it to the train (the schüür is about 5 mins from the station )

			Hi all,   
I have been to a couple of concerts with the Tonhalle-Orchester 
Zürich and would like to try other venues for a change. How do 
the other Swiss orchestras compare, e.g. the ones in Bern, Basel 
and Geneva?   
Next year, the Berner Sinfonieorchester and the Basel Sinfonietta 
will perform works by Ravel and Rimsky-Korsakov, respectively; 
I would like to attend. And then theres the quite famous Orchestre 
de la Suisse Romande. What do you think about these orchestras?   
Is the dress code similar to that in Zürich? I usually wear a suit, 
but while thats fine at the Opernhaus, the Tonhalle does seem to 
have a more casual setting.   
Best, 
davis
		    Hi Miles, For the 1st time I went to the Zürich Opera, private invitation with dinner, no black tie required. Just suit and tie. I am middle class but the people around me were kind of high society. I was a bit surprised to notice that many gentlemen around me were wearing mass-produced suits. Ladies were not impressive either, except for the stones. I mean, massive stones.   
Food was just Ok and service was not up to standard I was expecting. I can't stand female service wearing black bras under white blouses. And I can't stand male service with funky hair and tattoos.   
Down in the opera hall, you could find everything, including people with jeans.     
The orchestra was superb and elegantly conducted by Gatti, Cura was Otello. Great singer. Hampson was Iago, never heard him before, he made a brilliant role there.   
Very satisfied except for the cckscker of Graham Vick that made everything he could to fckup an incredible opera. These ""creatives"" put themselves above of the opera they are producing. These wnkrs tend to be gay, socialists and wealthy. 
Tanks in Otelo? Desert Storm uniforms? SVP posters? in an opera that sings about the Doge of Venice, sails and masts? This opera is not an atemporal Godot or the likes. It is placed in a fairly specific place and time. These artists! And they are paid so much money to mess around like this!
		    Had to laugh at this...   
For a season or two, maybe 5-8 years ago, it seemed that every production staged at the ZH Opernhaus included gratuitous sprinkling of severed (mannequin) body parts, wheelchairs and quasi-military uniforms, regardless of the plot. After a while it got amusing; we'd play the 'first one to spot the extraneous floating limb wins' game.   
Call me a bourgeois traditionalist, but not   opera benefits from such 'edginess'. And actually - it's really no longer 'edgy'.
		 
			
			Wow. Just wow. Your own personal dress code for who can attend an opera? Wow. While some people enjoy the tradition of dressing up for the performances, some don't. There is no dress code; an opera is not a gentleman's club.    
Wow. Gay, socialist, and wealthy are all adjectives used as an insult? Wow. You sure throw your net wide. If you don't like watching gay people perform, I strongly suggest you stop attending any classical music concerts, art exhibitions, or theater performances.    
Ok, you don't like modern staging, obviously. Well, then don't go to operas with modern staging. The staging is not a giant secret. Check the website of the theater in advance and see if it lists ""historical staging."" If not, assume you're in for some ""creative"" staging. Some people travel great distances to see a good modern staging. It's a matter of taste.       Why yes, yes they are. It's called the creative process. Would you prefer your art created according to factory norms? (perhaps...)
		    I can't describe myself as any of those three, and yet I find that statement tremendously offensive.   
Poor show, flavio. Very poor show.
		    What about having just a little respect for the composer's ideas/intentions? At the end of the day, the genius is Verdi not fckn Vickers.   
Don't fall 'victim' of the gay comment, just fckn read it as it is. So, if I say, boxers are normally black, does that make me fall into the racist category?   
I once had dinner with the great and late Alfredo Kraus, incredibly talented guy. He told me: ""I don't sing anymore at the Met, you know why? Because its a mafia, a mafia where gays and jews get all the right posts and performances"". He was not anti-gay, he was not anti-semitic. He was stating the fact that those two groups of people, and especially the intersection of both, were behaving as a mafia fraternity.
		 
			
			Let's leave out stereotyping, and focus on the music and artistic merit, 'kay?    
I'm not really a hidebound preservationist - I enjoy modern staging, love the challenge of new interpretions, often find updated productions give a whole new, intriguing meaning to a beloved opera . Afterall, the best works are timeless.   
However, my beef with some of the productions I've seen is that the staging seemed unconnected with the work, almost as if the  director felt that his vision superceded the music. I find that jarring. Staging - modern, traditional, 'edgy' should complement the work, not fight against it.   
But - chacun à son goût, as they say...
		 
			
			My groan has nothing to do with your name dropping, and everything to do with your profane homophobic comments. You seem to realize that your comments are offensive, but you are still practicing willful ignorance. There is no sense in debating the dignity of our fellow humans with someone who has already made up their mind. I hope that one day you'll be able to let go of that hate.        
To the OP, sorry for the derail. I'm afraid I can't even give you much good advice, as it seems that your area of interest is mainly 19th century music - which I don't have much to do with. I could give you some recommendations about pre-19th century or post WWII music in Switzerland if you are interested.
		 
			
			What an offensive post.   It seems you are more concerned to tell us how superior you are:  I have rarely met someone who loves opera and hates homosexuals and liberals.   
it seems you are more interested in projecting than asking what you claim to ask in the title
		    Thanks, 10:30. You are right, my favorite classical music 
works were composed in the mid-19th century to the early 
20th century.   
I thought maybe the EFers in Geneva, Basel and Bern would 
know something about these orchestras. Guess not.
		 
			
			Not true Davis, there are a few. 
I believe the thread just got a little side-tracked by the offensive nature of one of the responses.   
Of course it's a very smart dress code, unless you're attending a day performance.   
As for information regarding Swiss symphony orchestras, I would suggest you start with the Victoria Hall in Geneva:       
The Orchestre de la Suisse Romande will be performing parts of Tchaïkovski's NutCracker there on December 13th.   
You'll find a local and international mix.
		    Interesting observation. I notice that the audience tend to dress up when there is a guest performer. Suits and the works...      
I tend to think of a great orchestra as either one that has such a distinctive sonic personality that it sets itself apart, or one that is defined as special by the repertoire it plays. All the truly great orchestras boast an individual sound.   
If you want to check out other orchestras around Switzerland besides the ZRH Tonhalle, you simply must check out the Orchester Musikkollegium Winterthur:       
Another one worth mentioning is the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande based in Geneva. It made a number of memorable recordings of 20th-century repertoire.    
All of the above orchestras are technically very sound. Unfortunately, when it comes to musical intelligence and an orchestra's personal sound, I dont rate them as highly as I do with some other orchestras around Europe. *ducks*   
If you are still keen after hearing my rather harsh critique, am always looking for concert partners. Will be refreshing to attend with people who are passionate about classical music rather than my OH who simply comments ""nice"" after each concert.       Thats today! Anyway, thanks a lot for the link; 
there are a bunch of interesting concerts on the 
list for next year.
		    Have you considered going alone? I do it all the time, 
and actually prefer being by myself than with people 
I know. Not only does it allow me to simply enjoy the 
musicin a seat of my own choicebut I am also free 
to practice my German during the shorter breaks by 
talking to the strangers sitting next to me.   
But then, Ive never gone with someone who is just a 
concert partner. And thanks for the link; Liszt piano 
concerto and other stuff, which I might check out.
		    I go alone quite a bit - its hard to find concert partners and some performances cost quite a bit which my OH find it hard to stomach paying for something he doesnt quite appreciate.    
Enjoy the concerts!
		 
			
			Switzerland's orchestras are in the top league. For example, Ernest Ansermet took the OSR there and it has maintained a reputation for excellence. Maybe not so showy as the Berlin Phil, but regularly puts on top quality performances. 
Same with the Swiss Opera houses. Sure, you'll occasionally get disappointing productions, but generally you'll have top quality artists performing. 
As far as dress code is concerned, frankly I don't see much difference between London and Geneva. You have people wearing dinner suits and gowns, but you also have people not wearing ties, though I probably wouldn't dress down too much, at least at the opera. If I'm going to a 4 hour opera, my primary concern is to be comfortable!
		    Merci vielmal. And if you need a concert partner 
from March onward, feel free to PM me.
		    Thanks for that. The Tonhalle-Orchester performances have been 
very good. And even though Im not a big fan of the opera, Ive liked 
it so far (except the modern take on Carmen a while back). I will go 
see the Berner Symphonieorchester in January; I sure hope they get 
La Valse right...
		    Interesting comment. This is the first time I've ever heard of them being described that way.    
Care to expound as to why you think the Berlin Philharmonic is showy??

			By the way... is there any good   in Switzerland?   
I don't ask about organists because when there is a good organ, it is surrounded by at least a couple of very good organists.
		 
			
			On the dress code thing - I refuse to dress up simply because it's a classical concert, and it makes me very sad when I see a concert hall full of stiff, be-suited 70 year olds plus a few equally stiff, chic thirtysomethings.   
I like the orchestra being ""in uniform"" because that's part of the theatre, but on the audience side, any feeling that there is an obligation to dress up can only be detrimental to the future of live classical music.   
There are some good (but very infrequent) concerts at the Temple du Bas in Neuchâtel, but it's best to avoid anything with a big orchestra, the hall isn't big enough to contain the sound. Best seats are upstairs.   
Edit: Just to add something on Swiss concert halls, as a word of warning. I went to see a piano recital at the Casino in Bern (was supposed to be Murray Perahia but he was replaced at the last minute), and from the cheapest seats you can see absolutely NOTHING. The stage is entirely invisible because of the angles - admittedly these seats were very cheap indeed.  Luckily the hall wasn't full and it was possible to move into seats where half of the stage was visible.
		 
			
			Lucernes professional choir, Ensemble Corund, invites you to its traditional Christmas concert at the KKL Lucerne, Dec 26 2011, 5pm   
The programme is exclusively about English Christmas Carols:   
Gustav Holsts Christmas Day, 
Choral Fantasy on Old Carols, 
Gerald Finzis Dies Natalis, 
Cantata for tenor and string orchestra 
(tenor soloist: James Elliott) 
and Christmas Carols by John Rutter, 
Herbert Howells, William Matthias and others. 
Orchestra La Banda ANTIX (Igor Karsko) 
Stephen Smith, conductor     
If anyone is interested, I have 2 tickets that I'm selling for 80fr ono (paid 160fr) since we wont be in town for this sadly.       Have a look at the list of organs in Zürich. The ones in Grossmünster and Fraumünster are good. You can look up the details (in German). 
Hans Vollenweider, Andreas Vollenweider's father, used to play the organ in Grossmünster til mid eighties.       
And a bit of history regarding the Metzler Organs in Hombrechtikon and Grossmünster.     
			
			So, went to see Madama Butterfly @ Zürich Opernhaus. Adina Nitescu: beautiful and credible Butterfly performance. Tenor, James Valenti, hmmm, pass.   
Orchestra, excellent as usual.   
Production: Why? why?
		 
			
			the opernhaus in zurich is well designed and worth a visit.  tonhalle is not bad acoustically but by far the best place to get aural pleasure is the kkl in luzern.   
the worst place is the palazzo dei congressi in lugano. thank goodness la scala is not too far away.

			Hi there, have tried to find the answer to the following question but so far no luck, so hoping someone can help!!!! Going to the Maag Halle to see Emelie Sande in concert, and having looked at the tickets today, no seat numbers, does this mean this hall is 'standing' only? I'm not that good in crowds so seriously wandering now whether to go, or how best to deal with it! i.e. go in late to hopefully stand at the back......if anyone has any idea what this hall is like, can you please let me know. Thanks in advance
		 
			
			It's all standing.  The Hall is a nice size, not too big, not too small.  I usually stand at the back as I'm only 5ft 6"" and I get a better view, more room to dance and close to bar and toilets.

			Hi!   
I'm going to see my absolute favourite band, Mumford and Sons, in Firenze this Friday, and planning to stay the weekend in Italy.    
However, my ""partner in crime"" just cancelled - which leaves me with one extra ticket to the concert and no-one to go with!   
So, I thought it would be fun trying to find someone ready for an adventure in Italy!    
I'm 23 years old and from Denmark. I live in Neuchâtel and speaks Danish, English and French.   
Who's in?    
- Or if you are already going and wouldn't mind getting to know another big fan of these guys, please let me know    
			
			Hi!   
I am an American student studying in Florence and would love to go! A lot of my friends have tickets and are going but I didn't buy mine in time. If I can find a ticket you can of course hang with us!

			Hey guys, what's the concert environment like in Switzerland?  Is it more rowdy or reserved?   
The kiddo's want to see Bon Jovi in Bern this summer but I don't know what to expect from the Swiss crowd.  I'm probably not up for taking them if it's going to be an booze and boob fest.    
Anybody care to comment?
		    You'll only be adding to their traumas. I hear they use Bon Jovi CDs as white noise when interrogating Al Qaida suspects at Gitmo. They haven't had made a decent record since ""Slippery When Wet"" and that was more than 25 years ago.   
On the serious side, yeah, you'll be fine. Bern is a family oriented venue, no biker gangs using hard drugs.
		 
			
			How old's the kid? Do you plan on standing right in front of the stage?
		 
			
			Give them earplugs (just like at any concert), they'll be fine.   
Bon Jovi concerts are tame even in Jersey.
		    Yeah .... we were too late for tickets.
		    Agreed!  but some people have to learn the hard way       Sorry, they are 12 & 14.   
Probably not up by the stage, more likely to be a few rows back.
		 
			
			I took my son to see a Pink Floyd tribute band at Z9. He was 15. It was fine, and I would have been quite comfortable if he'd been 3 years younger.   
The thing about seeing older bands is the huge spread of ages in the audience. We had young bikers and little, old, grey-haired ladies.
		 
			
			If you take your kids to see Bon Jovi, I'm calling Social Services  .
		     
I'd say that you should be fine      My son wanted to go see KISS a couple of years ago.  I rose above my cool dad rep and said no       That's really the funny thing about the bands that have been around for a while, isn't it?  They were cutting edge when I was a kid, but now you've got Jon Bon Jovi doing aspirin ads and Motley Crue doing car commercials.

my OH is a huge Prince fan and i missed the cheaper ones for 175chf 
and called the festival office and they told me that 4 pm every day/night 
they sell leftovers for the original price. but: how about the queue? 
do i have to bet there 8 am to be get some at 4pm? do people go crazy there? does it depend on the artist?   
thx for your reply!

			We would like to invite you the first showing in Europe of Being Becoming winner of the excellence award at the New York Fringe Festival. Being Becoming is based on Bharatnatyam the dance of Gods .    
Being Becoming is a 75 minute Indian classical dance performance that explores an idea central to Hindu and Buddhist philosophies: that one can become the object of their devotion, meditation, or desire. Devotional transformation, or the idea of losing oneself or being consumed by the other, is extensively expressed in Indian traditions of poetry, music, painting, and dance. Each piece in Being Becoming explores the different ways in which the individual seeks to become one with the other, as well as traditional Indian theater techniques that enact the transformation from actor to character. Being Becoming is made up of five different pieces for solo, duet, and trio.

			Hi all, 
Guys, I need your help! I'm looking for a band playing blues and rock'n'roll, some old good music of 70-s - for my husband's anniversary in June. Fribourg and Vaud would be perfect! Ok, all Switzerland is not that big!  
I'd appreciate your help a lot - any recommendations are very welcome! Well - you also will be invited for a great party if you can bring a band with you!  
Thank you!

I am an Irish musician living in Luzern and could possibly organise something... I play in a few different style groups but much will depend on your budget? We can supply all of our own PA equipment for guests up to 300 people and transportation should not be a problem. Let me know what you think.   
All for now

			Hi Brendan, 
Thank you for reply! Can you give me a link to your band please? It's difficult to say something before I listen to you  
Looking forward to hearing from you! 
Kumana
		 
			
			Hi Kumana. 
For the exact type of stuff you want, ie rock'n'roll ... Chuck Berry, Elvis etc we don't have any recordings because this would be a session gig were i get the right people together for such an event... but listen to the band profile in our facebook page, but remember this is our own stuff not the music we'd be playing for you.  
also here is a link to another group i play in if you want to go more in an Irish direction      
			
			Hi Brandan, 
Thanks for links! Well, rock'n'roll is much more than just Elvis   Let's say ZZ TOP or STATUS QUO - I meant somthing more like that to tell the truth. So - thanks again for your offer but it's not what I'm really looking for. 
Good luck!
		 
			
			No problem at all but if this is the case i know just the band. It is a Basel based group. I can give you the number if you send me a Private Message me... i think they could be perfect for you.

			This is the BEST Rock`n Roll band I`ve ever seen/heard.  Their cover numbers are indistinguishable from the originals!

			Hi Kumana   
I'm playing in a cover band called ""circle of time"". We're on the stage for more than 1,5 years and have more than 30 concerts behind (private parties, big corporate parties, birthdays, weddings etc.) 
I beleive we're playing pretty much what you're looking for (see the songlist attached).   
If you have interest, feel free to contact me.  
Some demos are here:

			As a Canadian, I am ashamed they even exists.  And shame on anyone who supports them!

			I don't like Nickelback but they often tour with Daughtry and he is pretty good.

			I am absolutely not a Nickelback fan but I was working in the Hallenstadion this year when they were playing....all I can say is if you are you have to go! The stadium was sold out and I have to say the place was kicking. I'm pretty sure they were louder than Ramstein!!!

			How about you post these things in advance next time...      Party people aren't known for a lot of advance planning.        This equally applies to gatecrashers       keeps out all the losers who have to plan in advance       That's not true...  It takes a lot of forethought for us to get past the bouncers, come up with a convincing ""reason"" to be there; don't get me started on getting the free drinks...      In this weather I would pay any price to be instantly admitted to any Xmas ball before my testicles turned into balls of ice. Feel sorry for all young miniskirts trying to make it to nightclubs tonight.

			Hi All,   
I came across a banner while walking in Neuchatel about a month ago, advertising a series of Classical concerts in the region starting this month and going into March next year. Sadly I can't find the banner, the website or any information on this online.    
Does anybody know of this or have any information regarding this?    
If you know of any other concerts being held in the region, I'd be interested in hearing about them. Please let me know, I would much appreciate it. Thank you!

			I've just heard ""Dream of the Drowned Submariner"" from his latest album ""Privateering"". Great stuff. 
Any MK/Dire Straits fans here?
		 
			
			Yes. 
Great concert last year at Halenstadion, just a pity he didn't play more(instead of Bob Dylan).
		 
			
			Oh I heard about that one! 
A colleague attended and told me that Bob's voice made some in the audience get up and leave. Bob's not been one for vocals but never thought he'd provoke this reaction - guess age is catching up!
		 
			
			Loved the first Dire Straits album.  I have one of his solo albums ""Kill to Get Crimson"" and it is very good. 
If he comes down our way I would definitely see go to the gig

			Can't make it this year (boooo flu!) but I went to this a couple years ago and it was loads of fun. Well worth the trip.        
Too true!  And it was a fun night too!  I'm going to try to make it on Saturday.  Anyone want to join me?

			Hey everybody! Mika ( ) has a concert in Zurich November 8th! 
I am wondering if anybody from the Neuchatel area is planning on going and driving. If so, I would love to try to do a rideshare from the show, since the last train is at 23:00 and I have to work the next morning. I have to get back!  
I would of course help with gas money.     
-JJ!
		 
			
			I could give about 30CHF for gas (negotiable)! Time getting back doesn't matter too much, just as long as it's before 6 am the next morning!    
			
			I am not from Neuchatel but am going tonight. Can't wait!
		 
			
			Any chance you're driving anywhered near neuchatel?       From Winterthur?    
			
			Is there an opening act?
		 
			
			How was the concert? Worth seeing next time around?
		 
			
			I would also have loved to go, maybe catch him next time!

			Roger Waters is touring 'The Wall - Live' over the next year or so.   
It will be at Zurich Hallenstadion on June 6th 2011.    
Edit.  Also added 7th June.   
Over a year to wait but I guess it will sell out fast.   
More details      excellent, saw him on the Dark Side of the moon tour in about 2007 at Hallenstadion, i'll be there!
		 
			
			I saw it first time round in 1980 in London and in Dortmund, Germany.  Wish I had seen the Berlin version live in 1990.
		    ah well sadly i am just not old enough to have seen it first time round   although wish I had
		    Sadly, I am easily old enough.    
First presales for European dates are on Monday May 31st.  You need to register via the website.
		 
			
			The presales are being done by lottery. I.e. if you register, then you might get the chance to buy pre-sale.    
Mannheim is a viable alternative if you can't do Zürich.
		 
			
			I'd marry Roger.         
			
			Pre-sale prices Zürich.    
Floor Block 1;Rows 1-5: $318.47 
Floor Blocks 2-5; Rows 2-22, $264.97 
U1; Rows 11-17, $264.97
		 
			
			Where have you seen these ticket prices please? I'm desperate to get a ticket.
		 
			
			Did you register for pre-sales at  ?
		 
			
			I have now! I'm just wondering what the chances are of actually getting a ticket this way.  Maybe the whole forum could help us Floyd fans, and enter the lottery. We have more members than people in Lichtenstein, so if we make a combined effort we should at least get a few tickets.
		 
			
			I'm registered too - really hoping to get in the draw for pre sale - London's presale starts at 10am tomorrow anyone know when Zurichs start? 
caz
		 
			
			I never win anything, so I'm already depressed. Please, could some kind hearted people, who don't even like Pink Floyd, register and donate your ticket, should you get one, to someone who really wants to go.
		 
			
			Zürich presale starts tomorrow. You should have received an email saying whether you are in or out.   
Pre-sale tickets are NOT transferable. They're picked up at the venue with proof of id. I cannot afford to go.
		 
			
			Both me and my husband entered on the website and have both been given details to book tomorrow for the pre sale tickets - but the tickets are around 300CHF each for rows 1 to 5 at the front, not sure we can fork out 300 chuffs each - might have to wait for ticket corner to put on sale the normal priced tickets
		 
			
			OMG WTF BBQ how much now? Love the new avatar!!!
		    Debs PM me if you want me to book some tickets for you in your name - we have bitten the bullet and got some (not rows 1 to 5) but still a bloody fortune!   
2 tickets were about 500CHF
		 
			
			rubbish album...
		 
			
			I got quote in $. Worked out over 300CHF each - and that was for U1.
		 
			
			Let's be clear: this is Roger Waters doing a tour, NOT Pink Floyd.  And at those prices, give me a break.  And let's also rememeber that The Wall was mostly a Roger thing and contributed to the split of him from the others.
		 
			
			I saw Roger Waters Dark Side of the Moon tour in Las Vegas A few years back. Can't remember the exact cause that was in my Hippie years   If you get my drift. BUT it was by far one of my all time favorite moments of my whole life. Ranked up there right after my baby, and wedding. Haha. I am a die hard Pink Floyd fan and even have a tattoo on my back of the pink flowers in The Wall movie. SINCE they are no longer together I have to take what I can get, and if it Roger by himself, I am happy!!   Just signed up and am going out to throw pennies in the pond!   Tonight I will be looking for shooting stars to wish upon!    
			
			Fair enough, but those prices are ridiculous.  For the actual band, I could convince myself.  And yes, I live and breathe Floyd too.
		 
			
			From 'Roger Waters The Wall' Facebook page:      When I saw him in 2006 at Hyde Park, he had Nick Mason as guest drummer for the whole of 'Dark Side of the Moon'    
			
			I'd love to go, but not at those prices!!! no wonder the floyd can afford to collect ferrari's
		    You are going to suffocate!        
Hi! 
 I did register on the website and got an e-mail offering me tickets. Looks like some are already sold out.  However, it states that tickets are not transferable.  I would be happy to help you get them...not sure how we could do it though........     
This is what it says:   
Our  Price:                 $318.47 USD              
              				                 Includes  the following charges:                                                                       Presale begins Monday, May 31 at 11:00 CEST.                
                                        Our  Price:                 $318.47 USD              
              				                 Includes  the following charges:                      
                                                              				Floor Blocks II-V: Rows 2-22 				Section U1, Rows 11-17 				Floor Block I: Rows 1-5 - Sold Out  			              
                                              Qty: 				1 				2 				3 				4  			                Tickets will be available for pick up  at the venue on the night of the show. Please note that these tickets  cannot be mailed to you and are non-transferable.         
			
			I got picked for presale!! WOotWoot! Now just to convince the husband on the price...       That is a shame as it was one of the better albums of all time.
		     
when's your birthday? I'll buy you some cutips    
			
			If you get the chance to buy tickets, you can get up to four. If you only require 2, then you could, I guess, pass the other two onto anyone - the only proviso is that   have to pick up the tickets, with your id, form the venue. So this is going to take a level of trust.   
There's something I'd like to get off my chest. It's been festering for a week. Weekend before last, I was listening to Radio 4, in the UK, and I suddenly heard ""Us and Them"" being played. Afterward, the presenter ask some     whether she liked Pink Floyd. She said ""I've never really listened to him before, but I think I might get some of his albums""...    
And then a few seconds later,having obviously received a death threat... ""I mean some of their albums"".            July 1st.  But, I'll warn you my hearing is actually very good.  I am a sound engineer.     
(not that that always means much.    )   
What do you consider good as you seem to despise this particular album?   
My music collection is somewhat eclectic.        ""The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think.  Oh, by the way, which one's Pink.""
		    In the states we call these people ""Posers"" Ugh, such a shame, no doubt some sort of pop music fan... perhaps she would be better acquainted to Miley Cyrus?
		    Well, you're listening to the right band then.....   
			
			I'll go to a couple of the shows that's for sure. I saw them on the opening night at Earl's Court, London in 1980. Of course, the new tour is not a Floyd show, nor will there ever be again with Rick's passing. How I cried the day that I heard he died. You grow up with Animals, rebel with The Wall and play Dark Side until the record wears out. Pink Floyd was not the soundtrack to my life, they were much more important than that.
		    the one who looks like bob geldof
		 
			
			My son can play Dark Side of the Moon on the grand piano rather well.        
does it beat this          How much would he charge for a 2 hour show though? That's the burning question....      With my daughter on bass guiter, then it does. Very cool that though.      CHF 30. But without the stage show.    
I went to the same school as Nick Mason.       be a long time before he can buy himself a football team like that
		     
I hate when hashbrown makes sense... I do...    
I like Pink Floyd...  but pink floyd - waters, or Water + 0 pink floyds members just doesn't cut it.   
Im willing to accept Pink Floyd without Wright
		    And Learjets are going pretty cheap on the market right now too.....
		 
			
			Roger Waters seems to think that people in Switzerland have more money than sense    
Manchester prices are £75 + £9.00 handling fees.  It would probably work out cheaper to fly back to the UK for the concert.    
			
			Thanks for your offer but, and my jaw is still on the floor, not only did I get on the pre-sales list for Zurich, but to date I can also try for tickets in Ireland and Manchester. As was already mentioned, the prices are much cheaper in the UK so I'm going to check out that option. Once again, thank you very much for the offfer. 
I should buy a lottery ticket! 
""this is lucky Phil""......        You can put your name down for up to five locations.  I am in the list for Manchester.  No guarantee of tickets though.
		    Yes very annoying, my husband sent a note in to complain about the price inconsistencies
		 
			
			I can only assume it's freight costs that add to the price. I'm looking into going to Manchester, but it seems complicated. He's starting to annoy me!     
			
			Just received Zurich pre-sale prices in UK.  Tickets are £207.47 (EUR237.00) including charges.   
(Tickets EUR211.50 plus EUR25.50 handling)   
There seem to be some strange prices.    Buying your tickets in the UK seems to be a better option.
		 
			
			Manchester is sold out.      £207.47 ~= 350 CHF. The tickets yesterday (excluding the first five rows), were offered to me in $, and with conversion came to over 300CHF.
		 
			
			Just bought my tickets!! Woooohooooo I am so excited!  Now just to wait a year   Also, I don't know why everyone is so surprised that tix are more expensive here.... isn't everything??!!    
			
			Being a Floyd fan since I could manage to get headphones over my ears, I was rather annoyed at the ticket prices for Zürich. It's not that I can't pay the high asking price, I just won't!    
 176 or  211 per ticket to go and see one quarter of Pink Floyd and the freakin' bass player at that! No way!   
Considering that Roger Waters always scolded Gilmour and Mason for playing with their cars (ie. blowing thier money on boy's toys) in a couple of his solo albums; these tour ticket prices are obviously sticking to his strict socialist principles - er, not!
		 
			
			I'm going to Zurich. For me (controversial I know) Roger Waters was/is Pink Floyd. I used to listen to The Wall many times a week for years as a teenager, so I have to see this. I don't mind at all that it's just Roger, so long as the guitarist rips the solo from Comfortably Numb of course.   
As far as I can tell (the presale process is a little confusing), I have two tickets to Zurich. I tried to convince some friends to go, so as it stands I currently have one ticket free! 1 year and 4 days to go.       A free ticket! Great. I'll take it. Or do you mean ""available"".    
These tickets in the presale are for the premium spots. When they go on general release, I expect them to be considerably cheaper. I hope so, anyway.
		      Frankly I'm surprised a four star daydream didn't get higher priority around here.    
For the sake of all attending EFers, I truly hope Mr. Waters puts on a better concert than ""Pink Floyd"" was doing in the 90s.  I really love classic PF, but the last few concerts I attended (including that ""Pink Floyd"" concert) left me pretty burned out on big-name live shows.  Maybe I'm just getting old (and cheap?), but I'd rather kick back with the home audio and my favorite libations, etc., than pay CHF300 to play deaf sardine for an evening.       Phew, I was saved by a homonym!   
Yes, it's ""available"" or unallocated I suppose.   
I got the cheapest of those expensive tickets.
		     
Poor poor Syd..
		    RIP.   
Of the friends I invited to use my spare ticket, most were Dave Gilmour bigots, with a couple of Syd fans and me in the middle.
		 
			
			They should rename the tour ""The Roger Waters Pension Fund Tour"".   
signed,  
A David Gilmour bigot       
p.s. GE Smith on guitar? BwaH!    
			
			A second date has been added in Zurich: 7th June 2011.   
Roger Waters seems to be on a good little earner there    
(Two more London dates also added at O2 Arena)
		 
			
			I've just had an email from Roger telling me that he's doing a few extra shows, one of which will be in Zürich, on the 7th. We could see him twice.               ok so it wasn't directly from Roger.....   
			
			Great album but it would feel like watching a covers band ... I know Waters wrote most of it - but I don't want to hear anyone but Gilmour playing those guitar solos. Live 8 was stunning - would love it if they patched it up.
		 
			
			I remember watching Live 8 five years ago, not keeping up with the news, and wondering ""Who's the old fart they've got to do bass"" when I recognized Roger Waters from the photo in 20 Minuten when he was last here!   
I was beside myself in joy but my wife and children were out of country on holiday so I had to make do with dancing with my dog, who was non-plussed (not a big fan)   
Saw PF first in 1974 in Newcastle, doing DSOTM and WYWH, then Knebworth in '75 and Wembly Arena in '77 (never saw them do the wall, regretfully) and have been a bit of a follower of them since then   
Now if they had Van Morrison and Joni Mitchell on as well, like the Berlin presentation of the wall, then maybe I WOULD pay 300 stutz for it....
		    If they ever repeated the Berlin version I would readily pay a considerable sum to see it.    
			
			According to Wiki, the Berlin do, even with a quarter of a million paying punters and being broadcasted to 52 countries (including the UK where I watched it) only just made money - the profits were supposed to go to charity, but there weren't any.   
Nick Mason in his book   said the original Wall tour would have been economically viable if they had played to stadiums (50-100,000 people) but instead  they used smaller, ""more intimate"" venues - and it lost them all a packet apparently (except Rick Wright who had been sacked and kept on on a salary, the only one who actually made any money - the three other band members made a loss on the whole thing).   
So, here's our Roger playing Hallonstadion (max capacity 13,000) - I don't think it's going to be a big expensive show - just an outrageous ticket price.   
As Johnyhoar says, just a cover band with the somewhat shaky voice of Mr. Waters.   
Besides, the tickets are all sold out so it's just sour grapes on my part anyway.   
			
			David Gilmour is to join Roger Waters to perform 'Comfortably Numb' at one venue.  Which one, is being kept a surprise.  Is this a ploy to boost ticket sales or am I an old cynic?           ....... Yes.       dammit , now I have to go to every single concert....   
			
			Three years ago I bought a second hand B&O TV on Ebay.  The TV was advertised as having no sound. I bought it for £15 for the B&O Remote Control. 
When I went to collect the TV in Kensington; Roger Waters opened the door. 
He carried the TV to my car and asked me where I lived.  He told me that he had a friend a mile from where I lived that he visited regularly and would have dropped it round my house. 
The funny thing was that he is so careful with his money that he said that when he doesn't get a high enough price for an item on e-bay he gets his secretary to put a really high bid in to win the item and then has a dispute so that he doesn't have to pay the E-bay fees. 
I didn't tell him I knew who he was as I would hate it if I was in his position.  I should have asked him for a signed receipt for the sale of the TV and perhaps could have sold that on E-bay and got my money back for the B&O remote.   
			
			I saw Pink Floyd in the late 80s (Momemtary lapse of Reason, Wembly Stadium) and loved it.  Never followed Roger Water's solo career.
		     
Neither did anyone else   (bitchy) As our Rog remarked, he was doing empty school halls while the rest of PF were filling stadiums in the same town (""Playing   songs"" well it least they could sing and play them well, not just write them). As a life-long (since 1973) PF fan, I listened to ""the final cut"" once and threw the tape away (actually it's probably in some drawer somewhere), but again to quote Nick Masons' book, it's was full of stuff that they had recorded before that wasn't good enough to go in the wall album.
		 
			
			Saw Pink Floyd 1994 in Köln, Müngersdorfer Stadion.   
Guess this will be the last chance to see something close to it for the last time.
		    Sadly I don't think this will be the case.  It's not Floyd reincarnated, it's one album that is Roger Waters' solo diatribe of losing his dad and he took over full writing control on. It's not even the best thing they ever did, but one that RW has full copyright(at least for the lyrics).   
 But the rest of their stuff, after the pyschedelic Syd Barret era  (and trying to forget  Atom Heart Mother, which as David Gilmour remarked was pretentious rubbish), Valley Obscured By Clouds, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here (Animals a bit of a disappointment) and the three of them doing Momentary Lapse of Reason and Division Bell -   Pink Floyd.
		 
			
			Hope never dies... I didnt like Division Bell that much already back then.   
But they gave a good show with Dogs of war.   
BTW, I really like Dogs with Doyle Bramhall.
		    friendly wagers on which venue? i would be surprise if it weren't a london show. berlin maybe but wouldn't that be overplaying it a bit there?    
are they playing in pompeii? that would rock!

			Extra Zürich concert date just announced, now there's also a concert Friday, June 24, 2011. I'm sure the stage hands will thoroughly enjoy building the show up, tearing it down during the show's performance, then breaking it down again for a week and then repeating 2 weeks later.   
Pre-sale starts exactly now, 18:00 August 30, 2010 for those who have pre-registered their interest on the   website.
		    That would be a show not to miss!!!
		    I have the offer of tickets from the website but decided it is not worth the cost
		 
			
			Yeah, me too, but I am considering going to the show in Budapest. I could go to the dentist at the same time!     
			
			I'll be there on the fourth Zurich date! I wanted to see him here in the US but he was too far away, so as soon as I knew I was going to Zurich I jumped for a ticket. Unfortunately I will be about as far away from Roger as possible, but as an avid Pink Floyd fan born in 1989, this is as close as I can get! David is supposed to make an appearance singing Comfortably Numb at a surprise performance...since this is an added date, I kind of doubt he'll show up here, but I can hope    
Anyone else going to the 4th Zurich date?
		 
			
			Here is the official trailer to the show with details of the changes from the originial version          David Gilmour and Nick Mason joined Roger Waters last night at the O2 in London for Comfortably Numb. (I wasn't there)    
Looks like those of you in Zurich or wherever else you may be seeing the tour may have missed out on the guest performance.
		 
			
			The official You Tube of the reunion       
And the final part of the jigsaw: Waters, Gilmour and Mason reunited        
			
			Who else is going to the concert tonight?
		    Ummmm... me!    
			
			me toooooo , hubby has gone to collect tickets now - can't wait   
			
			Meeeeeeeee and if not for just seeing this thread i'd have forgotten all about it    
			
			Tomorrow, June 07. Figure they'll balls a few things up tonight and have it all ironed out for Tuesday so that I can air guitar in pure quadrophonic sound on the night.    
""So you thought you might like to go to the show; to feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow....?""
		 
			
			It was great. I loved it. Fantastic visuals - very engrossing.
		 
			
			amazing show - all the better for being 6 rows from the front
		 
			
			I've been to some great rock concerts in my time, unfortunately, this wasn't one of them. Way too much theater and not enough real music. When I was a teenager back in the 1980s it was all new to me, 30 years later Waters might not be such a miserable person, but he's still a bass player with 50% of the vocals and there was nothing really new except the screen projection and an emotional tear jerking roll call of fallen humans.    
If I concentrate on the music, the band kind of shot their load by the third song with the building bass on ""Happiest Days of Our Lives"" with nice red fluid visuals, but after that there was really nothing new. What I knew back in 1979 was that side 4 of the LP was crap apart from ""Run Like Hell"" and this holds, ""The Trial"" was always appalling either as a narrative or as a surrogate song and with about 20 people out of 10'000 asking our Roger to tear down the wall, it was rather anticlimatical when the bricks came tumbling.   
A harsh review? Not really. I'm a die hard Floyd fan, certainly more in the Gilmour camp, but it wasn't just Dave missing, it was any other musician that was able under the whole theater guise to show some artistic flair. Disappointing.
		    That 'Never go back' thought was part of my reason for eventually choosing not to go to the current tour.  I enjoyed The Wall twice on its first incarnation and was afraid that it may not live up to my memories of the first tour.
		 
			
			I was there on Monday, I thought it was brilliant. It is such a shame that more music today doesn't have this timeless quality, or more substance to the lyrics, ect. I had such good seats, and well worth the money. Even though during the airplane dropping $ scene, I thought it was a bit ironic.   I would try and go again if it wasn't all sold out! I love Roger, and thought the whole show was well put together, and beautiful. It really makes me think I should be doing more with my life.. lol. Hope you all enjoyed it as much as me       Did you see the Wall back in the day Assassin?
		    Yup, my pal and I skipped school to get tickets for the 2nd night at Earls Court, they were UKL 14 each and the program cost 8 pounds. Still had the T-shirt with the marching hammers until about 5 years ago. It was pretty much the same show with 1980s projection (ie. not very good but we didn't know better then) and a few bangs and thumps from the stage, but it all seemed so much better then especially as we hadn't heard the full version of ""Empty Spaces"" until the live show as they had to edit that song on the vinyl LPs as there wasn't enough space on side 2, even though the lyrics were on the sleeve! And then there was Gilmour's solo from on top of the wall for Comfortably Numb...., the end was still poor because of the lousy songs though. No encore then either; I was hoping for Echoes or some real music from ""Animals"".
		 
			
			Those of us that were BORN in the 1980's have to make do with what we can get. Of course Roger wasn't up to the same standards as ""back then"" he is almost 70. However I do wish David Gilmore was living in Zurich and had done his guest appearance here.   I thought it was really good, anyways and that we are all entitled to our own opinions. Especially on EF.       Well you are lucky to be an old fart then    
Monday night for me was the best I'll get so i'll take it happily       From what I ascertained from the original release date, the tickets are much cheaper when purchased directly from the venue or ticket agency concerned rather than through Water's ""web offer"". I got my tickets from TicketCorner here in CH far cheaper than the Euro price proffered in the e-mail merchandising.
		 
			
			Prices seem ridiculous prices!   
At those prices, I think I will go and buy a second hand Bang & Olufsen HI FI and the Pink Floyd Box Collection on Ebay and crank it up in Ticino at home.
		    I'll meet you half way and go for medium, but well built fart....
		 
			
			So, old fart, you see the show twice before, then complain about there being nothing new.... selbe schuld me thinks. 
For me it was the first time I saw Roger, the Wall, the Hallenstadium or big concert so I was well impressed.
		 
			
			Off the subject:   
Roger waters makes me laugh but is a down to earth guy:   
3 years ago I won an auction on Ebay for a used Bang & Olufsen TV with no sound for £10.  I bid becuase it came with the remote control that I wanted as a spare for my Band & Olufsen HI FI.   
I received an e-mail with the collection address (Kensington - London) and went to collect it. 
Roger Waters opened the door as it was him selling this broken TV for £10. 
He even helped me carry the TV out of the house to the car. 
I pretended not to recognise who he was. I did consider asking him for a signed receipt that he had received cash for it (thinking I could sell the signature/autograph on E-bay and get some of my money back......LOL).   
He asked me where I lived and I explained and he said he had a friend that lives very close to me that he often visits and would have delivered it if he had known.   
The really funny thing though was that he told me (ebay fraud !!) that if he is not getting a high enough price for something on e-bay, he gets his secretary to outbid everyone and then puts a dispute in so that he does not have to even pay the e-bay fees.
		    I wrote a personal concert review not a fairy tale piece of fan bumfluff. Merely pointed out that the music wasn't at the forefront, we're not arguing about what you thought of it, if you enjoyed it, that's very nice and I'm genuinely happy for you.   
Fact is, many bands and artists hit their musical pinnacle at some point in their career when they were unable to actually see it. If you take a look today, you might argue that Foo Fighters and Coldplay are at their peak vis-à-vis artistic output, but bands like U2 are past their best. That doesn't mean they can't still put out great concerts, but these days I go to concerts for great audio and to hear some personal flair rather than a playback of the album. Guess that brings diversity into it and a lot more travel to find obscure venues dotted across Europe.
		 
			
			I'm sorry to say it, as an old PInk Floyd fan, but Assassin is absolutely right about The Wall concert being disappointing.   
I too saw Pink Floyd twice at Earl's Court in the early 80s. The show was brilliant - great musicianship and theatrics. Somehow it just doesn't work now. Partly because Roger Waters is older and less depressed and partly because the Surrogate Band were really not that good.   
I was disappointed to see Roger encouraging the crowd to clap and sing along - for goodness sake, the Wall is primarily about his depression and contempt for the audience, so it just doesn't work as audience participation.   
I'm glad in a way that Roger Waters is a bit happier, but he should have left The Wall to history.
		    Good appraisal, it bothered me too.
		 
			
			For those of us who missed it, here is the complete concert           Then the younglings like me never had the chance to see him singing live    
			
			The tour is returning to Zurich Letzigrund Stadium on September 11th 2013.   
I wouldn't be surprised if Roger Waters includes some reference to 9/11 in the show as it is on the anniversary.       
			
			I have the option on eight tickets for Zurich at CHF180.00 each plus whatever booking fees appear
		 
			
			Saw that Roger Waters was the star at the US Memorial show a week ago where a bunch of ex. servicemen with various injuries took to the stage to play their instruments. Somehow I couldn't believe that Roger didn't take the opportunity during his long intro chat to state that there are injuries on both sides of a conflict.    
No, I'm not going to Letzigrund next year. But if you are intending to go, pre-sale tickets can be ordered as of today, November 17 from the link sent by the official Roger Waters website.

			Dear EFers,   
I would be extremely grateful if you could answer this mini-poll for me.     On which day (other than Friday or Saturday) would you consider attending a classical music concert, finishing not later than 10PM?  
Thank you very much!
		 
			
			Anyone else want to take a part..?    
			
			Most of our concerts have always been on a Wednesday or a Sunday
		 
			
			If it were a concert that I wasn't that interested in seeing, I'd be more inclined to see it if it were on a Thursday night; late in the week but not Friday.
		 
			
			Preferably the day the band I want to see are playing.
		 
			
			The day is the most irrelevant detail to me. The important ones are who and where.

			When I saw the thread title, for a minute I thought Robert Fripp was getting the band back together ..... in which case:        Hi JAPP, I have attended the concert, it was amazing! Was sitting in the first row and thinking about people who play)) Which instrument are you playing?
		 
			
			Great to hear you came to Bond! If you were sitting in the front row you would have seen me in the front row of violins (on the stage edge nearest to the audience). 
We usually go for a drink with the orchestra afterwards at Seebar, so if you'd like to meet any of the musicians, come by one evening.

			maybe, but I don't like rammstein+kings of leon  , will see Depeche mode in Bern and I am not sure about Green day, because Billy Joe is currently at the rehab 
(they canceled/postponed all the Gigs in the US until  further notice). 
I will travel to Manchester +London to see Bullet for my Valentine and like more  
punk /hardcore (like Rise Against/Pennywise ...), Rock like Pearl Jam or the Foo Fighters or Metal (Like Bullet for my Valentine or Avenged Sevenfold). 
Currently waiting for other festivals like greenfield to publish their headliners (Rammstein there again an Thursday).

			Hi LongLivePunk 
You can try to look at the prog of the Sommercasino :   even it's more something like metal, hardcore bands, it's in a cool place (I still recommand you to go at the Zatokrev gig, it's really a good band !)   
Otherwise you can look at Z-7 Konzertfabrik :   It's in Pratteln, a small town near Basel !   
Here too, but I think, it's more cultural :    
That's all I know about Basel ...
		 
			
			I recommend you go to this gig:

			Greetings to all of you, opera lovers!   
Some of us have still not had the chance to visit the Bern opera house and here is a great opportunity!   
Fidelio, the only opera composed by the genius Beethoven, now under the baton of Mario Venzago in Bern.       
Is there anyone interested to visit this performance? 
In general I am flexible but the weather is still fantastic in  September and I also try to save the weekends, hence  seems like a reasonable date.  
In my experience, Thursday is a great day for classical music!     
We  can meet 1 hour before the event and have aperitivo and/or also have  drinks afterwards.
		     
I may be interested in this, I need to see how my diary evolves tho.   
something else of interest is that Platee is playing at versailles next year. Since Rameau composed it for the marriage ceremony of Louis and Marie Therese and was performed for the first time at Versailles, this is a particularly historic performance. Paul Agnew is a very good singer too in the principle role
		 
			
			I would love to see a performance in Bern! Please keep me posted. =)
		 
			
			It's good there is already some interest, I will schedule an event and hopefully more people would join! 
Versailles is much more difficult to reach from where I live than the Stadttheater and I would rather spend the efforts on La Scala    
			
			I was traveling a lot recently and also moving into a new apartment, hence I could not commit to organizing anything as a 'calendar event'. 
However, I got the ticket for Thursday, 25 Oct and would be happy if anyone could join me.  
Lots of Beethoven in Bern these days!!

all the best

Yea, it would be good to  meet up.  I'll be driving straight from work and will aim to get there for around 7pm too.  I'll pm you my number.

			P!NK will give a concert in   on Tuesday, May 21 st  2013 at Hallenstadion Oerlikon! Tickets not available yet, but anyway:  Y e i ! ! !       
			
			I must say P!nk is fabulous in concert.   I saw her last time in New Zealand and it was a great show.
		 
			
			They are not available because they are sold out.  I already got mine.   
Its possible they might release more closer to the date of the show.
		 
			
			Are you sure? It says zur Zeit nicht verfügbar - maybe they want to sell the VIP packages first? 
Maybe some travel is also an option:      
			
			They went on sale on Monday the 1st.  It looks like the initial batch sold out.  I imagine they will release more closer to the concert date.
		 
			
			I hope they do release more tickets for her concert, I love her songs and have always been wanting to see her live, I hear she is really good...so fingers crossed!!!

Tel. +41 (0) 55 210 51 54 or per e-mail       will be playing new, original compositions as well as selections from his two acclaimed solo albums in the four CD Art of Sound series.   
Known for  , Johns aim is to make the improvising sound like its been composed and the compositions as simple and direct as if theyve been improvised there and then. In addition he brings to jazz a love of wide dynamic range and different touch at the piano, something which can best be experienced in the solo format.   
As well as an interest in advanced harmony and rhythm, Johns compositions and playing also explore harmonic simplicity and straight grooves.   
John Law, a prize-winning classical prodigy on piano, turned away from classical piano studies to pursue jazz and improvised music when he was 23 and has been involved in, and acclaimed for, his work in a wide area of different jazz, as well as modern classical, projects: from solo piano albums based on plainchant through trio and quartet work covering the whole spectrum from freely improvised music through standard jazz repertoire and works by Thelonious Monk, right through to composing large scale works for his semi-classical ensemble Cornucopia.  
His three main current projects are the acclaimed trio Congregation, with Yuri Goloubev and Asaf Sirkis, his new trio Three Ways, exploring both jazz and classical music, with Yuri and Julian Argüelles and solo piano concerts.

I just wanted to stop by to let you know about an indian music concert that's going on this weekend in Lugano. Wajahat Khan, the sarod player, is going to be performing this saturday 22nd at 20.30 at the Palazzo dei Congressi in Lugano.  
You can find all the info here:

			I've just noticed there is a planned concert of Ute Lemper in KKL hall, on November the 17th.  
Mrs. B. and myself are big fans of this extraordinary performer and I thought it would be an excellent opportunity for us to visit this hall for the first time. 
My question is regarding the floor plan, and I would appreciate if someone who visited there could tell me if row No. 3 on the parquet floor is much lower then the stage.  The lowest price category is for Reihe a,b then there is second category for Reihe 1-2.The third one is for Reihe 3 and 4.  
There are nice seats available in the center of Reihe 3.  
Generally we enjoy seating close to the stage and feel the ""sweat"" of the performers, but I was wondering if we would need to stretch our necks in order to watch the concert, which obviously would not make it fun. 
The next available seats are in Reihe 5, which is another price category.    
If anyone enjoys good cabaret, and would like to listen to THE BEST performer of Kurt Weill's music - come and join us!

			Kaskoklang presents:   
Michael Northam (US) + B°TONG (Switzerland) live in Basel 
Both musicians play experimental/ambient electronic music, each in his own distinct style. You find further information about the artists below.   
Friday 28-Sep-2012, doors and bar 20:00, first concert 20:30h 
A donation of CHF 15 is required.

Raum für aktuelle Kunst und Performance 
Warteck PP - Burgweg 7 - 4058 Basel     
> Kasko is located on the second floor of the former brewery Warteck. You can use the metal stairs leading to the second floor (located at the rear of the small court at Burgweg 15). It is on the same floor as the restaurant Don Camillo. You can also come to us by entering the restaurant, we are located behind the door with the opaque glass.    
Michael Northam 
Over 20 years involved consistently with a self-taught style of sound-painting with a combination of electronic, acoustic and organic sound sources. 
Sound has been for Michael a primary artistic form to explore indeterminate states of perception and consciousness.  Provoking questions about what are the building blocks of human experience and exploring that with extended and suspended states provoked by intuitively 'tuned' sound fields. 
This working direction is a two decade refinement techniques to explore complex, but deeply patterned phenomena found in nature and how such 'stochastic' sources are the essential elements of our most intimate inner and outer tapestries of experience. 
Michael records from nature elemental sound materials from wind, water, plant material and incidental man-made phenomena - often where these elements interpenetrate each other.  Using these kinds of sounds he then practices in primitive-musical ways to imitate elemental phenomena with various instruments (percussive, electro-acoustic, acoustic) such as playing sea shells, bird calls, japanese pentatonic flute, resonating metal objects, etc.  Furthermore years of auto-dictactic acousmatic studio experience produces 'compost' of interwoven live and recorded materials into ever unfolding new works that been left behind over the past years as internationally published recordings and site-specific installations. Most recently a series of works entitled 'watchthingsgrow' which have been 8-channel aleatoric sound-works for Botanical Gardens. The work ""Frozen Illuminations"" has been presented on Radio Deutschland Kulture, last year, as well as, numerous self-published collector edition items on Michael's personal label OROGENETICS. 
Because of years of developing a personal sound, he is increasingly sought after for extremely precise and unique experiential sound-design for international dance, performance and cinematic projects.  Works premiering in Belgium, India, United States and Germany. 
Currently developing a project with Bavarian performance/installation artist Judith Egger concerning indeterminate states of consciousness.            
B°TONG 
B°TONG is Chris Sigdell, former member of the German experimental/industrial group NID (1995 - 2005). With B°TONG, he reaches for the nether regions of experimental electronic sound, and has established himself as an acknowledged experimental soundscape creator. So far he has shared the stage with such known artists as: B°TONG has appeared at festivals like Sinus-Series (Basel 2006), Ausklang (Hamburg 2006), Shift (Basel 2007 & 2008), Lab 30 (Augsburg 2009), and has performed on various radio stations. B°TONG has collaborated with other artists, is part of installations (Polarkreis & 95° by Brigitte Gierlich & Camilla Schuler), video-projects (Images by Ulrich Fischer), and does his own clips to assorted pieces of his musical catalog. The video to Sphere II was shown at the 2007 Miami Art Fair as part of the Urban Nomad film-festival; the videos to Black Dog Dream and 95° were shown in Beijing (Taiwan), and his latest, Fragile Package, made by a local video artist.   
The music is a choice of dark brooding layers of sound, high pitched tones, and weird electronic sounds that give birth to images of darkness and tranquility, the solitude of an icy polar night or the equivalent of an underwater journey into the bottomless pit. 
B°TONG uses samples from television, radio and film, and processes these on the computer with recordings of his voice and other. There are no instruments involved! In a live-situation Chris relies on instruments like microphone, metal-sheet, electric toys, and kitchen utensils. The sounds made with them are fed and put through various effect-pedals giving him that trademark sound.                   
The concert is kindly supported by Kaskadenkondensator.

			Does anyone know if Evanescence will perform in Zurich? I really admire her music. I would love to go to the concert, and wait for her so she can sign an album, and so that we can have a short chat.
		 
			
			I think you missed her. She was in Zurich back in June.    
She has her tour dates on her website. Not sure if she has a newsletter though.      
			
			Now I'm disappointed.    
I hope she comes in 2012 or 2013.
		 
			
			Other than the fact that Evanescence is not a person, but a band....
		 
			
			I get those mixed up sometimes. 
Amy Lee* is who I meant.
		    Is she Alvin Lee's sister?

			Anyone going?
		 
			
			I'd like to see Kraftwerk, but I can't be bothered to wait for hours in a muddy field with people smoking dope around me for a 45 minute playback set.   
Is there a special package available for middle-aged rock fans who just go for the music? I'll sign up for that.
		 
			
			No, thanks, too much electronic music there this year. 
I will head over to reading and watch foo fighters, the gaslight anthem, black keys , Bullet for my Valentine.......(Sunday 1 Day only I am going)   
I can recommend this years gampel  where the foo fighters , beatsteaks or eagles of death metal will play (on thursday 16.08.12).   
or head over to Konstanz where Green Day, Beatsteaks, Flogging Molly and Social Distortion will play (Sep. 01st 2012).   
I got 1 ticket left over for Winterthur 16.08 where Flogging Molly  and the Hives are playing (PM if you are interested).
		 
			
			Just did St Gallen a few weeks ago and we're heading down to Gampel festival soon. Looks like an awesome venue...   
Zurich Open Air had such a good line up 2 years ago but this year is all electronic . I don't understand....   
Can't wait to see the Foo Fighters, last time I saw them was 1996 on the Gold Coast, QLD. My first festival...... AHHhhhh the memories         Here's hoping next year's line up will be all obscure Country & Western music acts then, eh!?    
JK, I just dig electronic music that's all !       I like repetitive music, I like repetitive music, I like repetitive music....   
Nah I like electronic music too, Paul Kalkbrenner being my favourite. It's just the last line up for Züri open Air was so different, more rock bands...
		 
			
			nope, it's a bit much for me. but i'll enjoy radiohead sept 20.
		 
			
			I´m probably going there as a volunteer. I´m going there alone because my friend who supposed to go with me changed her mind in last-minute. So it would be great if I could meet there someone    
Btw. I´m 22 years old girl from Cech Republic.   
Hey,It told me I couldn´t post more than 4 private massage per day :/ So please PM me your email address please    
			
			I was there yesterday to see The Wombats and of course The Killers. It was awesome!
		 
			
			Bought a ticket for tomorrow, Bloc Party, Orbital and Kraftwerk.
		 
			
			Will be there tomorrow.. is it muddy ????????
		 
			
			May head over there this afternoon just wondering how the mud situation is?!
		 
			
			mud situation should be good, they covered the ground with boards. 
(how slippery that will be, no idea...) 
Going to see Fanta4 on Sunday, won't be much electronic there, they're playing unplugged! yay!
		 
			
			Flogging Molly in Winterthur!!!!!!
		 
			
			I went on Thursday, mainly for The Killers and The Wombats. Both were awesome!   
Did anyone see Bloc Party the other night? I was going to get tickets for that but they were the only band I would have really wanted to see that day. As said above, a lot of it is elector or dubstep, not my scene really!   
One thing that was a bit annoying was the fact you had to buy tokens to get food and drink. Has that always been the case? I remember having to do it for Montreux Jazz a few years ago but they stopped it. If it is to help boost revenue it seems a bit counter-productive for me as I would have probably spent more if they took francs!
		 
			
			Saw Bloc Party, Orbital and Kraftwerk, awesome.      This was terrible, I'm sure it's just a con, how many people walk out not cashing back their chips because they made it such a hassle?  Not only did I lose some of the tokens, we tried to take some cups back before Orbital came on so we didn't have to hang on to them, just wanted to exchange them back for tokens, can you do it at the beer tent?  NO, got to go to a seperate little tent hidden round the back.
		 
			
			We went along on Saturday without any expectations and had an amazing time throughout.  It was a lovely atmosphere, with very friendly people.   
""Kraftwerk"" were superb although the 3D glasses for this gig were less than useless.  Surprisingly, my sunglasses proved more effective although I soon took them off for fear of losing them in all that mud whilst dancing!    
It was our first time of hearing and seeing ""Mogwai"" and who totally rocked!   
The ""Bloody Beetroots"" DJ-set were awesome, as were the other DJ sets we listened to earlier in the day but had no idea what they were called.    
All in all, a fun and fabulous weekend all round!    
			
			Quite surprised that no one counter fitted the tokens. It would be quite easy to do and would save a ridiculous amount of hassle.
		 
			
			I was all for going along until I saw the price of CHF 88 for one day entry!!  Could hear the boom boom from my house though, so all was not lost....   
			
			The Mud Problem at the Zurich Open Air is still unsolved , there are new problems (Tokens , Toilets, Sound; Camping)...........   
Because the music was not my cup of coffee i traveled to the Reading Festival 
(Last Foo Fighters Gig for a long time), no Rain on Sunday, no Mud, had an awesome Time at the barrier, loooking forward the the gig of Green Day in Konstanz
		 
			
			The music was top banana for an old (ahem) electro bunny such as myself. Storming set from Orbital.. and Kraftwerk was like some weird modern classical art thingy.   
Although a total atheist I'm now convinced there's a higher power who hates Mogwai.. the only band I've ever seen rained off (to be fair, one of the monitors did seem to be about to explode).    
Such a shame we couldn't stay for the Beetroots.   
The decking was total genius.. it would have been horrendous without it.   
The token thing kinda made sense.. the prices didn't... 10 quid (in proper money) for a burger !!!!   
Very Swiss... very expensive.. very enjoyable.

			Bought David Garett Basel concert in January 2012. Concert 12. November 2012. Discover pregnant in March.. Giving birth 1st week November.   
Called up ticket corner and explain, but they refuse to refund even though it is such an early stage..   
So where can I sell my tickets? Ricardo? It seems alot of people are also selling David Garett tickets. 
Or maybe if my doctor writes a medical excuse that I am not fit and the insurance will pay?   
The tickets are expensive (CHF 120 for 1) and in the worst case senario, we will give it to our friends staying in Basel...   
Any better idea?

			Hey all!  (Or...ya'll!)  Last night my husband and I stumbled across a little country music weekend fest thing in Ouchy.  You know how they do a different cultural theme each weekend, well this weekend it seems to be American/country music.  There was a cover band playing some old faves from Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks and the like.  They even had a line dance group called ""Happy Boots"" which I kind of want to join!     Anywho, I was pretty delighted at the whole thing, and we are going back tonight because at 8pm there is a country singer from the US performing.  I don't remember his name, and I didn't recognize it when I saw it, but who cares.  Should be pretty nifty!  Anyone going to go too?  Come say hi!

			Hi guys!   
I will be in Switzerland for the next two weeks ( from June, 17th til June 29th )...    
Are there any places where there are some rock bands playing? Can be local bands playing tribute songs and so on... I just wanna have some fun =).   
Thanks for your help.
		 
			
			Fribourg, starting 22 June.     
			
			I think the big concerts are already sold out. Ask someone to keep a free copy of ""Friday"" for you. It is a free magazine, in the blue boxes, and gives information on the local music and stage events. If concert tickets are available you can buy them at the Post Offices.
		                       
Many more concerts and festivals, plenty of tickets available. 
Albanifest in Winterthur starts June 29th, lots of bands, all free.   
If you tell us where you are staying in Switzerland we could get you more information about local bands and festivals.
		     
			
			Maybe also checkout   there you can find all concert going on in Switzerland for the next few month.
		 
			
			Motley Crue and Slash are playing tomorrow night in Basel at St Jacobshalle.
		 
			
			hey fellow metal heads...is there any update on upcoming shows?? thanks!!
		 
			
			Tickets for concerts are sold out months before the concert. If you don't want Madonna, try searching on this auction site,        
			
			if you want some metal in August, here you are:

			Does anyone have any experience in organising a charity gig/concert/music event?   
Please contact me if you do and would be interested in getting involved in organising one in Zurich!
		 
			
			Organising any kind of gig in Switzerland is a major headache, you must provide ear plugs, you must not go over 100dB, you must not average a certain dB for 30 minutes or you will be forced to take a break etc.   
This is without even finding a venue, getting bands, security, people to direct traffic into the parking etc.   
It is not easy and there are many rules which you need to observe, it is very easy to get it wrong and then maybe even the gig doesn't go ahead.
		 
			
			Try looking through the Suisa website as it gives you an idea of the regulations and requirements that Nigelr is talking about        
As a matter of interest, what kind of charity is it your organising the event for? Also what styles of music or artist are you looking to perform?    
Unfortunately i'm not back in CH until summer 2013, but i am interested in what kind of event you're trying to put on , as i work in the music / events industry here in the uk.    
Scotney x
		 
			
			Nigelr I can imagine! I have been to enough gigs in Zurich/Basel to see first hand what a nightmare they can be just to attend never mind to organise... i can and NEVER will get my head around the earplugs thing. It isn't a good night out unless your ears are ringing all the way home haha.   
Getting bands shouldn't be an issue as i am a musican and i know plenty other musicians. And i am hoping that for a charity gig people will want to participate even more.   
So yes i am just beginning to do my research! Even though the idea has been in 'the works' for some time.   
Thanks Scot-ney for the link, i will check it out asap!   
We have a list of charities, based around helping disadvantaged children in the arts. And an event in the 'rock/indie' genre of course    
Have you organised any events in Zurich as of yet? Or just in the UK??
		 
			
			So far i've not organised or been part of any events in CH except as a muso. My event management experience is all based in UK so far.  But i understand it's much harder there due to the regs set out by Suisa.    
You'll find the 100Db limit nigelr mentions to be standard in the EU nowadays. Even major festivals in the UK are limited to 95Db for outdoor stages and 93Db for inside tents.    
The earplugs rule is a new one on me ..... though I'm already half deaf as it is lol It just means you have to stand a little closer to the Sub's so you can feel the Bass hitting your whole body .. works for me   lol

The band's inspirations come from folk and country music, especially  Townes Van Zandt, Neil Young and Johnny Cash but also reaches out to  Scott Walker, Leonard Cohen, French chansons and Jaques Brel. The core personnel of this band pretty much always  stayed the same and their current lineup presents  ,  ,  ,  ,   plus now  , ex-Willard Grant Conspiracy.

2-day pass is 130.-
		 
			
			if it was the same night ( amazing double bill? )  maybe.. but I don't think I could work up the lust for life in order to do two nights in a row.            
Unfortunately not.  
I'm very tempted, Avenches is only 15 mins down the road from me.

			I love Loreena McKennitt!!! I am so excited I can't seem to find the date or venue. Do you have any details?   
Edit: I think this concert is sold out    
			
			Wait what? I only get to know about this stuff too late...   
Is it really sold out?    
			
			Yep. Such a shame. I checked on ticketcorner.ch. The concert is on 17 March 2012 for goodness sake. One thing I can't get used to in CH is the amount of planning it takes to organize anything. Oh, well.    
Apparently they are still available for the Geneva concert...
		 
			
			Tickets are sold out... for March 2012?    
Oh well, I have the CDs...
		 
			
			Hopefully, they will add one more show in the afternoon. It is a shame that the ticket is sold out. PM me if someone has ticket left. Many thanks    
			
			Man! I never hear about these things till it's too late.    
			
			Turns out it's not too late after all. I am now a proud owner of two tickets for the March concert!

			Will have to poke OH for that   Thanks for the tip!

I have also got my ticket. Really exciting for this concert. Hopefully I can meet you in the concert and others Celtic fans from EF.

			The concert was wonderful. I am not ashamed to admit that a few renditions brought tears to my eyes. What a lucky coincidence it was St Patrick's Day yesterday. Saw quite a few people in what looked like traditional Celtic costumes. The atmosphere was very lively people cheered loudly after each piece. The venue was full to the brim. She performed a few encores because the crowd didnt want to let her go. 
  It was nice to have met you, Swissant. We must do it again sometime.

			Just curious to know if anybody else on this forum plans to or has any interest in seeing Jason Mraz live. 65 Francs a ticket, according to the MaagHalle website. In the era of so much 'plastic' sounding music, I find his songs to be a refreshing dose of talent and originality.
		 
			
			In Zurich ?
		   Only in Zuri would Jason cost 65 Francs a ticket! He is from the richest part of north county San Diego called Carlsbad where there is nothing but very old rich people. 
Traurig.... 
Happy sunny sunshiny bless summer everyone!! Ich wönsche allne en glöckliche und sunnige Juni und summer.Ich wünsche ein gesegnetes mega schönes Wochenende in Liebe    
			
			well, if you don't like plastic music , you don't have to wait until November, but  
not in Zurich: 
Head to the gampel open air , Aug 16th, headliner there will be the Foo Fighters. 
Tickets (Thursday) are still available (93 sfr )
		 
			
			Is 65 Francs unreasonable for a concert? I was thinking that it was quite a decent price, especially given that the Foo Fighters (good band, by the way) ticket costs almost 100 Francs and tickets to Coldplay's recent gig in Zürich were over 100 Francs.
		 
			
			the cheapest concert here in zurich i have been to was ""the minutes "" from ireland "" no tickets in advance , paid only 20 sfr at the entrance, good rock Music, second place been"" the Gaslight Anthem"" at the Abart for 40 sfr 
(awesome concert Jun.05th this year)   
The ticket for the day at the gampel includes more then the Foo Fighters, there are 8 bands playing that day (incl. the Foo Fighters), it is a bargain , i think
		 
			
			I too rather enjoy Jason Mraz...better than Madonna, and less expensive.
		 
			
			When will be the concert held?
		 
			
			The concert is Wednesday, 14 November 2012, 20:00. 
I am glad to see there are other Jason Mraz fans on here!

			Hi everyone!   
  Tomorrow, the summer solstice, many towns across Europe are celebrating music in all its forms (except Geneva and La Chaux de Fonds who hold this on the weekend). Lausanne has got a lot planned this year, on a number of downtown sites, for music going from choirs and classical music, to hiphop to electronic music to rock. In all there'll be 160 concerts!   
The official website is    
and I recommend getting the smartphone application by scanning the barcode on this page:    
So, is anyone interest in meeting up and walking around town tomorrow evening? Of course each site will have food & drink available, although I usually prefer to walk around with a bottle of wine and some plastic glasses  .

			Just for a heads up cirque de soleil are comming with there show to Zurich for those who like this type of show.       
I saw it when it was in Amsterdam last month and got some last minute cheap tickets. It was a good show they even bring there big top stage.   
The video can also be seen on the link above.
		 
			
			Last time they came in 2010, the tickets got discounted for the last performances and prices got similar to UK ticket prices. Looking at the web site I strongly suspect they are selling tickets in tranches to look as if there are not that many available. Each day seems only to have the tickets available in the same zones, and in my logic people do not buy to the same pattern every night. Maybe worth holding out for a while.   
Positively the show last time was great.
		 
			
			I love this show.... 
They are really worth the money and time to visit.       
			
			My family and I really enjoyed the lat shoe in Zurich so will be heading to this one as well....thks    
			
			I've seen quite a few of their shows and was never disappointed. They even made me wish I could be a trapeze artist when (and if) I grow up.    
			
			Thanks a ton for posting... i love their shows from lasvegas... but the tickets for some dates already show sold out.. got to buy some today  .....
		    when i seen them in amsterdam (corteo) we bought the tickets on the day of the show whe got in the blue area (second most expensive section) and alot of the seats in the green where vacant.   
you could hold out for cheap ones. but I think the zurich run is only for a couple of weeks where as the amsterdam run I think was for five.      seen la nouba in florida years ago! I haven't seen the las vegas show but this show is a classic! show i would say. in florida it was as if they had implemented action stunt sections by bringing in motocross bikes and mountain bikes. the shows I had seen in london didn't have these! (I have seen five soleil shows now) this focuses on a strong artistic performance with classical circus acts.    
not as performance dance orientated as verkakai and not as grand as drallion. but I liked the smaller bohemian stage atmosphere and acts. and the split theater stage design works well. It still has real creative magic in the performance.   
hope this helps!
		 
			
			Thanks for posting and the buying tips! 
I am planning to see it

			Sonisphere festival on May 30th 2012 at Yverdon-les-Bains.  Metallica headlining with Slayer, Motorhead, Mastodon, Gojira and Eluvietie.  Pre-sales start Friday, 17th February at 8 am.
		 
			
			I'm soooooo there dude!
		 
			
			What's the likely hood of this being sold out very quickly? Will try to get tickets tomorrow morning but just wondering if I'll need to be there at 7.59 refreshing he page haha    
			
			Tickets are 120/170 CHF on the web page, I really, really want to go...   
I will try to get more tickets tomorrow morning, if I manage at all...   
I think I will be going alone, maybe we should do organize an event going there?
		 
			
			I thought I would see a chemistry test......
		 
			
			cool - I assume the show ends really late ... do people head back to Zurich afterwards? Does anyone know a good place to stay in YlB?
		    from the sonisphere website:      otherwise there are a few camping sites available nearby.        
does anyone know how many tickets are being sold for this concert? i'm kinda playing it by ear waiting to see if some more interesting bands fill in the lineup. i'm not much of a metallica fan actually.
		 
			
			I'm not sure how many tickets there are.  But its only a small place.  I've been to Hyde Park, 80,000 and Milton Keynes Superbowl, 60,000.  This is tiny in comparison.  The local kids here already have their tickets.  Buying mine at the station very soon    
			
			I managed to get one ticket on the pre-sale. Probably will go by car from Lausanne if anyone wants to join, we could arrange.
		    I bought my ticket already as well.   
I'm interested in arranging to join you for the car ride.
		    Hi, tomorrow is the concert, anybody else want to join? The concert starts at 3.00pm not 3.45pm as it is written on the ticket...   
Anybody knows if cameras are allowed inside? How about parking arrangment or it's better to take the train? If we go by car I will have 2 free places if VINNI still wants to join, otherwise 3.
		    Hey, I'm still going. Didn't realize that you are in Lausanne though. I'm in Basel, so that's not going to work out! That means that you have 3 places    
			
			I'm going from Zurich, on the train, but will miss the begining, I'll be there in time for Motorhead though (I hope)
		 
			
			Vinni , 
  My brother and I will be leaving Basel, by train, at 1300 
wanna join? will pm you my number.       
from the website- 
small cameras are allowed. 
Professional cameras, film cameras and recording equipment are NOT  allowed within the festival area without a  permit given by the festival  organization. 
(SLR cameras with removable lenses[?] are not allowed)   
also, you are allowed to carry booze inside, but only a quantity that can be consumed by yourself. I think i read 1 beer and 1 hard liquor. 
no glass items allowed.   
   Cheers!!!
		 
			
			I loved the way the sun disappeared from sight just as soon as Slayer started playing. The Dark vibe was at it's fullest... what an awesome show that was!
		     
			
			They rocked, They rocked HARD. 
Great evening. 
Pyros where the bomb     
Sorry that didn't meet up, my phone decided that it didn't want to communicate, just listen to the excellent tunes. Can't blame it really.     
			
			The phone networks were completely saturated, I'm surprised they didn't add a gsm tower or two. Mobile networking was paltry at best... doesn't matter!

			Hello all metallers,   
I am curious to find out if anyone is going to Sonisphere 2012 in Yverdon-les-Bains. 
I am going down with some friends but it would be good to meet up for a beer/meet-and-greet with some other people from EF when I am there.   
It is for sure going to be a great day with some awesome music!

			I've got a ticket. I'm in Zürich, and working so might not go until later..... I was about to ask if anyone else was going from Zürich that I could maybe travel with...... Never having crossed the rostiditch before.
		 
			
			I guess there's no more metallers in Zürich. 
Sigh.......
		 
			
			maybe just not on this forum :P haha
		 
			
			I'm going, with my brother who is visiting!! 
we're in Basel.
		 
			
			I'm in Zuri and I'm going tomorrow  
Cheers

			Just got given two tickets so will be heading to it. Looking forward to it

			Anybody here likes Irish music? They are coming to the German part and im very interested to go. Im not really in the mood to travel 2 hours minimum (possibly an overnight as well) on my own.   
Anyone interested to go? I dont mind which city really since im coming from Geneva    
Here are the tour days. They are coming in February. Tickets are between 50 and 70 francs. I will probably go for the 70         Bern - Theater National(CH)   Basel - Stadtcasino(CH)   Zürich - Neues Theater Spirgarten(CH)   St Gallen - Tonhalle(CH)   
I would be interested in the Zürich concert!  Thanks for posting.
		 
			
			I'm a big fan. I might also come.
		 
			
			Thanks for posting!   
But cripes, I scheduled a week long snowboarding trip during this time.  Bummer.  I hope to catch them another time.
		 
			
			My name is a dead giveaway   Already planned on attending the concert in Zurich but have not yet bought the tickets. We could schedule an event if more people would be interested?    
Gata let me know if you need a place to spend the night afterwards. I have a huge sofa as well as a guest bed.
		    Thanks   It sounds very tempting but im assuming you are a guy and my OH wont be very happy!   
Anyway the concert is in a hotel anyway so worst case i will get a room there. Maybe be better to actually book it in advance. Its almost 3 hours to Geneva and im not risking to miss the last train. Bern its much closer but its a question of where most people want to go. Things like that are not much fun on your own.    
Maybe one Zurich person can actually make an event of it closer to the date with maybe a coffee or dinner before/after?
		 
			
			I'm on for the Zurich concert, I'll be back in touch once I have booked my ticket, thanks for the heads up on the event.
		 
			
			I saw them in Basel last year, they are getting on a bit to say the least. 
A good gig, and they are great characters, but spoiled by the audience clapping along en masse to 95% of the songs.
		 
			
			I have been a fan for many years and I visit there concerts every year wherever I am (all over Europe). I booked a few months ago for the Zurich event.
		 
			
			I'm actually going to the Basel show.
		 
			
			Might well be tempted by the Zurich night, You'd be very welcome to stay at mine Gata, OH shouldn't have any worries on that score       I am actually female :-) I will post an event later on. Let me know what you decide about the hotel.
		 
			
			hi Folks,   
just moved to Basel from Ireland, first time post, glad to see the lads coming to town. Any idea where to buy tickets for the gig? 
cheers.
		       
This is where to get the tickets online. Otherwise at the Basel Ticketcorner office.  I' going too.
		 
			
			thanks Biff.  I'm getting no joy there, would it be sold out you reckon?
		     It could be sold out by now - from memory it was full house last time they were here.  BUt, it could be that the site is down at the moment - I have just checked and it's not saying ""fullhouse"" so perhaps try again later.  You could try one of the other sites that have tickets - but the one I have checked, has the tickets at higher prices.  Or go into the ticket office on Monday and try there. If all else fails, turn up on the night and you could get lucky at the door. :-)
		 
			
			The site is working now. :-)
		 
			
			Ahhhh, my first date with my (now) husband was a Dubliners gig in London somewhere - they were joined half way through by Shane McGowan.     
Not here for the Basel date this year, what a shame, would make me feel all young and romantic!
		      Thanks girls   OH wont have a problem with that. If he doesnt come with me it will be something to think about    
			
			great Biff, 
we're sucking diesel now, cheers!
		 
			
			I hope they are still up to it. It looks like a punishing tour and they are not getting any younger. But I have fond memories of them and hope to make it to Bern on the 1. Feb.
		    They are. Not really much older than MIck Jagger. :-)
		 
			
			Bern is looking more probable for me as well. Need to check tickets and train times. If the OH makes it that is. If he doesnt i will go by myself!
		 
			
			In case people watch one thread and not the other :P   
Ok OH said he is not coming so im coming with a friend instead. Can please somebody from Zurich just confirm that the theater they play in comes with a hotel attached?
		 
			
			Hi Gata   
Yes the venue is in the hotel. The Hotel is called Spirgarten and more information about the hotel can be found here    
As you will be travelling with a friend you should be looking for a Doppelzimmer (room with two separate beds). The price should be 199.- (per room not per person and including breakfast) as it's a weekend.    
Let me know if you need further help also with directions etc.
		 
			
			Thanks you are great! I will book the tickets today since it will probably be sold out soon and meet with some EFrs for drinks before or after since we most likely wont be sitting together
		 
			
			Just a small bump. I got my tickets for Zurich yesterday and there arent that many left
		 
			
			Thank you for letting me know. I just realised that I can't see who submitted a reply   this was my first ""event"" and I think I made a mistake.    
So if anyone reads this and wants to join me: I will buy the tickets tonight. Please PM me so that we can sit next to each other.    
Thanks   
PS: Gata could you PM me with the row that you bought - I might try to buy tickets close to you    
			
			I'm thinking about going to this, have to just persuade my wife    
			
			I can't join you as I'm going with some other friends, but am definietly looking forward. This will be my third Dubliners concert.
		    Or don't persuade her. Such concerts are good places to dig chicks.     
			
			So i guess there will be loads of us but we wont be sitting close to each other.   
Ok a request for Zurich residents. How far is the concert place from the Viaduct and which bus/tram/walk you lazy a** can we use to get there?
		    Pre-event drinks then???
		 
			
			It's quite a way gata, too far to walk, Tram 2 goes there and you can walk from the Viadukt to Badenerstrasse over the Hardbrücke to catch it.... about 20 minutes I seem to remember. If I do get tickets (will know later in the week) we can arrange a group drinks and journey
		    It's a bit far to walk, but not impossible. It might well take 45 minutes or so.   
The closest tram stop to the concert venue is Lindenplatz in Altstetten. Tram number 2 stops there. Maybe the easiest way though is to catch the number 4 tram from the viaduct and ride to the terminus at Bahnhof Altstetten from where you can either walk or  hop on the number 78 or 80 bus and ride 2 stops to Lindenplatz. At Bahnhof Altstennen you have to cross to the other side of the railway tracks using one of the subways. They are signposted.
		    I think if you take the number 4 tram, there is less walking involved.
		 
			
			Ok im lost. My friend used to live in Zurich though so she should be able to find the place.    
Anyway change of subject: Hands up everyone who wants to meet for a few pre show drinks at the Viaduct          Looks like we will go, so drinks at my place first..... !
		 
			
			Its a date!    
			
			So no one is going to the Basel show I guess?
		    I am going to the Basel performance..    
			
			Just saw this but am already signed up to do a charity drive that night. 
Enjoy those who'll be there, haven't seen them since 1987......25 years ago!
		 
			
			Great concert, great company and great craic.     
The Dubliners may be old and bearded, but they still got it!  They took their audience down memory lane and it was an enjoyable evening of memories, music and stories.  They are indeed the Rolling Stones of Irish music.
		 
			
			I agree - it was a nice concert! Although they didn't sing one song I really wanted to hear    
			
			It was a great evening with great company   but now I really want to go to the dirty old town.......
		 
			
			We had a great time as well! Im glad they sang the wild rover even at the end. I would be very dissapointed if they didnt.
		 
			
			It was a great evening. I loved the videos of Luke Kelly, Ronnie Drew and Ciaran Bourke. I have been a fan for many years so I will always remember them.  I am very fond of Barney McKenna he is one of the best banjo players in the world. I love his song: I wish I had someone to love me.  
I just arrived a few minutes before the concert started and was quite surprised seeing so many people who have attended the events for the last few years. Everyone hopes the Dubliners will return next year. They are over 70 (except Patsy Watchorn) so we all wish them good health.
		 
			
			I saw them in Basel and fell asleep, making it a concert first for me, and quite a let down.   
Now, I know they are old, but I didn't buy the tickets either. I mean atleast half the show was a few guys on stage occasionally strumming on their guitars, and fondly looking back at the huge screen on the wall watching passed front men sing songs.    
I have youtube for that, and atleast I can enjoy a beer as well.   
NO beer, no water allowed in the most cramped concert hall I have ever been in. No chance to enjoy a concert the way it's meant to be.    
And while I understand they are all considerably old, perhaps if you are too old to be interested in being on the stage for more then 20 minute periods of time(as the ""younger"" ones were constantly leaving the stage and going in the back while Barney played on), perhaps live shows should not be done for you.  
I know as old blue singers back in Chicago that, although most of the night their performances are done in chairs, rock it out, sing with passion, and are entertaining.  
I am sure the Dubliners still love their music, but it was more like an exhibit at a Museum of Irish Folk Music, then a real concert.  
That was my Basel experience. Maybe they flew through the air in Zurich.   
Also, I was in Ireland just a few months back and saw guys just as old performing for hours, getting paid probably 100 times less, so it's not as if I am not coming from a point of no reason.   
The video experience had me wishing I was 30 years younger, and at a show then, which I shouldn't have felt.
		 
			
			Well Confloozed, in Basel there was a standing ovation at the end. From where I was sitting ( and standing) it seemed that the complete audience were standing, clapping and swaying to the music by the end of the performance - with the possible exception of the folk at the end of the row in the balcony.     
But, I admit I would have liked to hear the whole of Black Velvet Band.  Maybe next year..
		    When they played Whiskey in the Jar?   
People were standing because they weren't sure if it was the end of the show or not. And that was for 3 songs. And it wasn't everyone standing. Just the people on the sides.
		 
			
			I must say I liked the way they did tributes to the departed members and showed some videos presenting them at their best (even if being a bit ""politically correct"" in the biographical details). But I did feel that it was a pity that so many great songs weren't played whereas many of those that were played were more or less the same style. I missed not hearing John play St Patrick's Cathedral, which is probably the best of his violin solos. There was also way too much in the way of drinking songs and too little of the other styles such as fishermen's songs, comic songs, ballads, romances, political songs and the other things they have done in the past. Also, Barney was disappointing in comparison to previous years. I understand he must be getting on a bit but that's no reason to let him mumble incomprehensible commentary into the microphone for so long. I also felt the evening didn't really have a proper build-up or sequence but just random songs arranged in random order.
		     
Apparently Barney has advanced diabetes and is mostly blind. He has round the clock nurse, you probably saw him being assisted by him to the stage.   
That's not to say he shouldn't play if he wants to, but it felt like most of the rest of the band were even more exhausted then he was(though except for his original problems never looked more tired then that).
		    Where were you sitting. It was NOT just people on the sides. I could clearly see the whole centre block standing, as well as all of one side - from the front row to the back.  People sat down again for the encore song, which was a quieter one, but then stood again for the final round of applause - as in loud applause, not muffled clapping of people leaving.

Were we at the same concert?
		 
			
			The Zurich one was nice. Ok the first part was boring as i didnt know any of the songs they played. The second part was one of the same except the end where i knew a couple of songs.  
I enjoyed it though. They are also easy to talk to    *very smug smile*
		 
			
			I just found out that Barney McKenna died a month ago    
Im glad i saw them then and didnt wait some other time. RIP
		    Now that is very sad.   
How very brave of him to continue performing until the very end.   
Music will not be the same without him   
Barney, we will miss you!

			Hi,    
I've got an extra ticket, for the JT concert on Sunday, if someone would like a good seat, please PM me. It's at 7PM at the Zurich Kongresshaus.    
Cheers,

			I have two tickets, and if someone takes them off my hands I'll buy Milagro's one. James Taylor! He's great!
		 
			
			Interested in your two if u can still get the one. How much r tickets? Good seats? Will  check email every 30 min till show. I live in Zurich (Zollikerberg)
		 
			
			Hi, someone took Milagro's ticket, so I'll use mine. I've never been to Kongreshaus before but I assume my seats aren't great. There were five or six left on the guy's screen - they still might have a couple left if you don't mind sitting in the corner. Mine were 60 each.
		 
			
			Too  bad. Enjoy the show. Where did u get yours? I don't know what you mean by ""guys screen"". Thanks.
		 
			
			I got them from the ticket place in the middle of HB (in the main hall near Imagine bar).   
When he showed me his computer screen there were ten or twelve red dots indicating available tickets. I was happy it wasn't sold out so I bought two in a corner where maybe the view isn't great.

			Just in case anyone is still looking for tickets, I just noticed (and bought) tickets for the Zurich May 26 show. A large number of tickets have gone up for sale for the previously sold out show at Letzigrund Stadium. Not sure why.

			178.70 CHF.  
I'm no expert, is that a reasonable price?
		 
			
			Well , i wouldn't pay around 180 sfr for a seat in a sector with limited view(Block 2 or 23). 
If you don't care , go for it.

			My good friend is looking for a single female to accompany him to the James Taylor concert in Zurich. He is a Australian, mid 50s and very sporty. No romance required, just loking for good company. I wouldn't post this if I didn't trust him! Please pm me if interested.
		 
			
			Tell him to keep lookung or us, we will be there, too. We meaning me, MG's SIL and a mutual friend (unfortunately not a female  )
		    Why a single female then?
		 
			
			Good question! He just wants some female company. He lives in a tiny village and doesn't get the chance to meet any women. I'm just trying to help him out.
		 
			
			And whats your cut for pimping him out   
			
			Ha Ha! Absolutely nothing, just being a nice person as always  He's been a good friend. Jon met him at German lessons a few years ago, will need to introduce you to him. When are we going to meet at S & S? Would love to catch up.

			Hank Chinaski aka Charlie Bukowski, would have loved this band. He'd  been much obliged and honored by them, picking ""Barfly"" as the title for  their first studio album in 37 years. Rocket from the Tombs was founded  in 1974, burnt out in 1975 and their recorded work survived mainly in  the form of bootlegs. Some say, this Clevland band originated  'punk'.  (Wayne Kramer, Wayne County, Johnny Rotten, Sylvain Sylvain a.o. might  disagree...). Actually, so does founding member and Pere Ubu frontman,  . 'Punk' was nothing but a fad, he says.

			Anyone going to Rock Werchter this year ? We missed out on tickets and are searching frantically trying to find them at a half decent price.    
Anyone have any ideas ? I've looked at ebay.be but I've never used ebay and I'm not so keen on sending someone a bunch of cash in hope they send me an authentic pdf file of a ticket....   
			
			You can try this :       
			
			Thanks but it means we have to drive all that way in the hope that we get tickets at all...   
Will probably give it a go nonetheless      
			
			Hello EFers,    
Is anyone going to the Rock Werchter festival in Belgium (1-4 July)? 
The line-up looks tremendous!     
Has anyone been in previous yrs, any feedback? 
Cheers, 
Loveducky
		 
			
			I ve gone and worked there for the past 10 years. It is a great festival but the crowed has gotten a little young these days....It is now gigantic though and an awsome time , but be prepared to pay top $ as it has gotten so expensive....... .      
Stay on camping A1, it is the biggest and used to be the best. Its also right across the street.
		 
			
			Just looked this up...a bit pricy mind, but a cracking line up with a chance to see five of my favourite bands in one day woop woop!   
Arcade Fire 
Them Crooked Vultures 
Vampire Weekend 
The Black Keys 
Gomez         
So, anyone planning to go?
		    It's probably just you gotten older    
Werchter is great! I love the atmosphere at Belgian festivals - mixed crowd and they don't seem to be too smoothly organized like the ones in Germany and Holland (oh my I wonder how I will handle Swiss festivals now I moved here...).

Who are you going with Prof? Anyone I know?
		 
			
			Wish I'd seen this earlier on   hope you have a great time!
		 
			
			Great band,i would quite likely of gone if i had known it was on.My fault for not checking the various Gig Guides.Oh well.   
Saw them at Swindon many years ago and i suppose i have 3 or 4 albums and a couple of singles.
		 
			
			How was it guys?   
Did they do much ""newer"" stuff?
		    They did Pole Shift, Rapture, Fema Camp, In Cythera and Corporate Elect off the new album. Plus Chop Chop, Bloodsport, Change, Sun Goes Down and others I've forgotten already. Great gig. Best I've seen them play in Switzerland.   
Cheers.
		    Thanks - I definitely need to get the new album on the iPod.   
I'm a sucker for  ) - especially with You'll Never Get to Me and House of Pain as the stand out tracks (IMHO).
		    Was great. One of my favorite bands for the last 30 years.Was surprised that there was more space in front of the stage then around the bar. Yeah, old people moshing...   
You'll never Get to Me is kind of the 80's style but they always had a special unique style.
		 
			
			I saw them a couple of weeks ago in Strasbourg and they flounced off stage after ballsing up the end of Requiem, and didn't return for the scheduled encore (I was by the mixing desk and could see the setlist). I wondered if they might implode in the dressing room, but they obviously didn't.
		    The biggest issue is that I like listening to them - at home/car - but the wife doesn't - and always skips onto the next track if one of theirs comes up on shuffle       Drop her...      Had tickets for that gig but had to drop out. Youth has a blog going where he says this:   
We are in Strasbourg in France near the border with Germany.   
Everyone in band and crew are feeling pretty burnt out after last nights stupendous gig in Paris. Great food again ,   
Tonight i almost left the stage as my bass amp blew a fuse, however i was trumped by Paul whose turn it was tonight to freak out when he smashed a bottle of beer by his kit and stormed off stage and then later threatened to leave the bus if Geordie swore at him again on stage, i understand how he feels as Jaz routinely swears at me onstage if play a note different from the record , i usually ignore him and turn up and play even more differently but sometimes the very public humiliation is too much. I miss that, when on the Pandemonium and earlier tours we had more of a psychedelic/spontaneous vibe to the performances, i think Jaz gets confused if we go off piste too much and also his classical work is very regimented and that spills into the band sometimes.If i could persuade the band, we would be doing a different set every night, but so far I had an idea last night that Geords liked, of getting a VJ in to do some psychedelic projection visuals while we play, will see how far this goes with rest of band and management.          Heh. Yeah I was at the front, absolutely knackered by the end. I had a green Malicious Damage t-shirt on.
		 
			
			Thank you Taratonga and who I think must be Johnny D for the first then the 2nd of tickets. Most of all for including us and making us feel welcome. Honestly was a great show. I can't think of anyone that age showing so much continued feeling and strength towards their music. One thing I hate about seeing an older/aging band is how it seems like they are just up there to collect some cash off their namesake, and just make the least of efforts.    
This was not the case with the Joke last night. I haven't been to a concert in almost a year, except when I was in Ireland of course, in Switzerland where I enjoyed myself that much. Even if that guy was 20 I would think he was about to have a heart attack at any given time, because of the amount of intensity he put into his performance. My only complaint is that they spent a bigillion years doing a sound check(the club, not the group), and they still couldn't figure out how to put his mic levels to sound better then mush.   
All the same I had a good time, with all that were there.
		 
			
			Aw, too bad i missed this,i hang out with them in prague a bit..   
As per sound check,it's annoying when too long,but honestly,it's worth it,if you like your ears..last time i saw KJ live,the sound guy slacked and it was a nightmare. They are finicky with their sound requests and quirks...   
Last time i was on their guest list,raven put me on it....sniff.rip raven.
		    Yeah the ringing is quite low today and we were close to the speakers. I just don't know the lyrics as much as others, and I think if I could hear more, I mean F' he was singing in english, it would've even been better.
		 
			
			That was indeed a great night and a great performance   
Excellent company Roger and friends, thank you x
		 
			
			Yea.. we were there too, right down the front getting thrown about. These guys have allways been a big part of my music al influence really , I play in a Swiss ""rock"" band but we are all really old punk rockers at heart, Stranglers, Clash and Killing Joke being in the top 3. 
If you guys like KJ then for sure your gonna like us too ( ) our EP solid state nation comes out this weekend (28th) ..spotify, amazon and so on. 
We also play at Rock City in Uster on Saturday night & if anyone wants free tickets to our London Camden show on May the 11th, just ask, I got 30 comps for that night.   
So lets debate .. 
is KJ a punk or a rock band or where are they .. Post punk alternative maybe. 
Or are unique?

			Lada Gaga's tickets for her September concert in Zurich went on sale this morning at 10am -  so I went online at 9.57 and tried. and tried - found myself in the waiting line.    
come 10:06 - standing places sold out.   
Sigh...    
anyone have any luck?
		 
			
			Try SBB I sAw a sign on the counter that they started selling them at 10am this morning
		   says tickets are still available online.     
Tickets sold at SBB Zürich Hb ( among other places ) 
GA holders / MobilBonus members get a CHF5 discount voucher
		 
			
			Try, try & try again. Ticketcorner often release more tickets in the hours following (or say its sold out while they re-assess and then a few more tickets come out). Almost always find that 'sold out' events have a few extra tickets pop up periodically during the same day it sells out. Good luck!   
Oh, and often it will say standing is sold out, but if you click on the seating plan, you'll find a handful of tickets that you can purchase from that screen only.   
You've just got to be checking at the same time as a few more tickets go back into the main market...
		 
			
			I went to her last show in Zurich (fantastic) and got tickets from Ricardo at face value.   
There were also TONS of scalpers at the event looking to practically give away their tickets. I don't know if this is illegal here or what the rate of ""fake tickets"" is (if any), just telling you lots of people were trying to sell tickets at the event.
		 
			
			I'll see if SBB have some later on... A while ago there was one single seated ticket available.   
As for ricardo - it's an option, but it's pretty irritating to see a page of results offering tickets for the concert already!   
20minuten is already warning about overinflated prices on the grey market      (German)
		 
			
			For the next time, become a member of Ticketcorner (Friends and member), cost is 49 sfr/per year, you will get tickets in advance (one day earlier) , a magazine (every 3 months) and a dedicated entry at the hallenstadion, so you can show up late and regardless that fact you have a chance for the front row

			I have heard of the great Mapping festival that takes place in Geneva each year 10 days of arts,music and Visuals all over the city has anyone been or seen the event at all please?

		    Great its what I do full time here at present, Ive heard great reviews about the festival and one of my main suppliers/sponsors is heavily involved in it..I dont know if I will be over for it but would be good to hear some reviews    
			
			Full time?  What sort of firm do you work for?  It's something I've been interested in for a while, would love to try larger scale stuff, but can't afford the projectors...     
I've got a project on the go, need to mix a bit more in the community.
		    Hi Cyrus well Geneva would IMO be the centre of Visual arts and VJing artists... The festival is the largest in the world held each year in and around Geneva.. I work for quite a few DJ/artists along with a lot of private corporates(not fun) Not sure if you can see the link but this is one I worked on a couple of years back in Dublin with the digital slaves..         
			
			Know anyone who might be interested in this?              How do I get there?  I need directions.  Landmarks.  Celestial navigation.
		           
			
			[QUOTE=cyrus;1535382]Know anyone who might be interested in this?   
Thats cool stuff nice YT channel.. Do you approach any of the nightclubs there at all? Are you on VJ forums? Im going to be moving to the Vaud area with my family and setting up my studio there... There are a lot of corporate companies that love this style of art and marketing its just about networking and selling the idea I guess. It is also getting a lot cheaper and easier to do with technology now...       Not yet, I DJ already, and am currently trying to build a suitable stand for the DJ booth so people can see it in the right environment, and working.  I'd never really considered video to go along with DJing till someone introduced me to Quartz Composer.      That it is!  Apart from the DJ kit and DVS software, I'm working mostly with the Quartz Composer, which is completely free and amazingly versatile, and started out with a bunch of hand me down projectors, though I've since got myself a nice short throw projector.

			Well here goes....    
For chitter and chatter about gigs up and coming to run along side the wonderfully implemented calendar events and for the numpty simpletons like me who prefer the old fashioned way      
hopefully this will replace Jot's great 'Zurich Gig Guide' from the past - but will please all the unfortunate bumpkins that live outside the canton of Zurich    
			
			Why is it that some people have so much difficulty dealing with change?   
IMO This thread is pointless and selfish.
		 
			
			I was sure I was going to get groans for that and they will all be from people living in or around Zürich...   
When in real life a small group of people sharing the same interests (for example Zürich inhabitants, blondes, Audi TT owners, whatever...) joins up with a bigger group (for example Switzerland inhabitants, ladies who like to dye their hair, Audi owners...), you can then tell them a 1000 times that it doesn't make sense them staying together in their small group, that they should open up to the other people...If they don't want to change they won't.
		    well then go to this   instead? we cater for all    
			
			Primal Scream Xtra 16 th August.
		    Are you going Annie and Nicky? We may have to re-arrange my schedule a bit so we can go because they are good live.
		 
			
			We are Nigel, booked our tickets today.
		    Not sure yet - not listened to any of their recent stuff
		 
			
			The latest album is really good. Check out the website    
We now have tickets as well.       
I am also wondering about the Delilahs at Kaufleuten on 13th August.
		    Don't you think that there are Primal Scream fans living outside of Zurich?
		    Primal Scream are playing in Zurich therefore it is a 'Zurich Gig' - I created another thread to post gigs in Switzerland should anyone wish to....
		    Grrr.... 
Zurich is in Switzerland.
		    Why don't we have ""Yawn"" button as well as Thanks & Groan?
		 
			
			Well you all found this thread about Primal Scream playing in Zurich so whats the fuss.      PS I dont live in Zurich Kanton.      I found it because I actually live in Zurich and am registered to this thread.   
But why should a Primal Scream fan who does not live in Zurich have to wade through 10 pages of Zurich concerts to discover that his favourite band is going to play in Switzerland?   
If you want to keep this thread fair enough but please also add the events to the Concerts Calendar!
		    Who let you in? Anyways, this thread is far more pointless and selfish, it's only for Zurich Stadt       True but we should also have a ""This poster is being selfish"" button that would be worth 10 groans.
		    Why register to something that seems to cause you so much angst    
Anyone only using this ""Heads Up"" thread or the EF concert guide is going to miss out on plenty of things they might like anyway. It contains a mere fraction of what is going on. Compare it to a comprehensive gig guide eg   ,   etc   
Real gig guides exists elsewhere, so I certainly can't be bothered replicating them on EF. Call me selfish if you must, but it only caters for those who like to be.....       
			
			We have the Concert Calendar, we also have the Zurich Gig Guide thread and the Switzerland Gig Guide thread - is this not enough?    
Martin if you want to add Primal Scream into the calendar then go ahead - Mannie Organ decided to post it here and that is entirely her choice but it does not stop you creating an event   
After the demise of the Zurich gig guide some people (me included) missed having a general thread to chat about and mention up and coming gigs.   
I am sure people living elsewhere can still look at at this thread if they see a new post added to it - especially if they are interested in music and are willing to travel - if someone decided to create a Basel Gig Guide I would follow it, just because i Live in Zurich doesn't mean i wouldn't be interested in gigs in other cities   
where's the flogging a dead horse icon for this bleedin topic......
		 
			
			Martin - you groaned Mannie Organ for merely posting a gig that is happening in Zurich in the Zurich Gigs ""heads Up"" thread, do you really believe that deserves a groan? as far as she is aware she is posting in the right place... really some people.....
		    The difference between the EF concerts calendar and a general events website is that the concerts mentioned on here are focused towards the expat community.    
According to your reasoning if information that was already available on the Internet should not be added to the EF then there wouldn't be much content on the EF.   
What I don't understand is why you can't create a Primal Scream Concert thread on the calendar for the 16th August and then have your discussion there: ""Are you going?"", ""No I am going on holiday"", ""Pity because Primal Scream are good"" etc... ?
		    Go for it Martin, very happy for you to go and post the event in the calendar, jeeze I'll do it if it will make you happy?
		    No I groaned at her because she knows of a good concert that could interest other expats but decided not to add it to the Calendar.
		    everytime this thread gets bumped to the top, i think there's a new concert...       I posted it in the Zurich thread because the bloody concert is in Zurich,end of story.          Most of the gigs I go to are with Swiss people. They have remarkably the same taste in music as ""expats"". EF is intended to be a ""Community portal for English-speaking people in Switzerland"", not an expat ghetto.      People do often refer to outside web sources. The real value of EF is in the info that isn't so easy to find, and peoples experience and opinions.      I've not been overwhelmed by the volume of your contributions to this calendar (was it zero or nil?). It's a bit rich to be handing out tit-for-tat groans to contributors and using that as an excuse.
		    That is the whole point of my groan. If you post your comments and information somewhere in the middle of a gigantic Zurich Concerts thread it will not be easy to find.
		     gigantic one and a bit pages.
		    Exactly the problem, and not exactly unexpected.  That is why I wonder why there are mutliple gig threads.  It serves no purpose other than to keep those in Zurich happy and the rest of the board uninformed.
		 
			
			I give up.      see everyone uses things differently, I prefer this way rather than the concerts calendar, the gig is posted and then if no one adds a comment to that event then it gets lost in the pile - whereas I see a new gig added to this and it appears in 'new posts', if i decide i want to go to the event mentioned I put it in my own calendar, I find this solution easier, however i appreciate that you don't, we can't please everyone and I think it will just have to be give and take   
If in the future you see a gig mentioned on this or the other thread and you want to create an event in the concerts calendar then go ahead but don't groan at people if they have chosen this method if that's what THEY prefer   
Nicky
		    For the moment but by August it would theoretically be longer.
		    It's a conspiracy for sure.   
Magnolia Electric Co.  25 Sept  El Lokal , Z*****
		    And why not post it to the general concerts thread?  Do you specificaly not want others to know about it?  Or do you feel too many concerts go on in the rest of the country that it would be lost?
		    Cyrus I didn't post it in here but I actually advised Mannie Organ to post it in here so yes slapped wrist - but it is actually a Zurich concert, not exclusive to Zurichers but it is happening in Zurich - the thread exists and it seemed a suitable place   
I think you are being a bit pedantic over this... is it really all that important? a gig is happening in Zurich and it was posted in the Zurich Gigs 'Heads Up' thread       It is pedantic, but it's not just me being pedantic is it?  I just feel everyone is better of with a general concert thread, but those from Zurich can't seem to post their concerts to a thread that doesn't have the word ""Zurich"" in it.
		    I think 'those' from Zurich can (if they want) Mannie Organ isn't even bloody from Zurich she posted it here because the event is IN Zurich, quite a logical decision do you not think, when confronted with 2 threads, one called Switzerland Gig Guide and the other Zurich Gigs ""heads up""    
Basically don't blame the messenger, it's the mods decision what to do with the two threads and so far they have been left as they are, so...... a user comes along and posts a zurich gig in the zurich gig thread and she gets groaned and hassled about it       
			
			Ok, to summarise:   
There was a Zurich Concerts thread, people weren't happy and made a General concerts thread. Then people weren't happy because gigs in their area were getting lost in the big General concerts thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... People still weren't happy so there was a Concerts forum created.    
People still weren't happy because they could only discuss a particular concert in a thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... then the non Zurich people got pissed off...     
FFS people, no one is going to be happy all the time. Its not the end of the world, get off your high horses (Did Hsiang ever find out where to procure one?) and go to whatever concerts you want to. If a gig is in Zurich why can't the people that live in Zurich discuss it in a Zurich based thread. If they were going to go to a gig in Luzern I'm sure they wouldn't object to it being in a Luzern gigs thread.    
I think a certain amount of ""cop the f**K on"" is needed here.
		    Actually the old Zurich concert threads served well for all concerts in the country, because most concerts happen in Zurich, there were no other threads.  I thought a title change would be appropriate to reflect the actual content of the thread, but obviously, that was just too much.
		    Well then you should have left well enough alone and not tried to fix what was not broken.       But why on earth do you guys have to have these general threads why not simply create an individual thread for each concert and discuss the specifics there.   
That was Nathu's aim when he created the Concerts calendar.   
This reminds of procedural language programmers who couldn't understand object-oriented programming: Now every concert is one object.
		    Because maybe they don't want to!   
You are still perfectly entitled to post the concert in the concerts thread should you so desire.
		 
			
			It's annoying me now how I bang on about it, I understand how some people prefer a single thread and some like the events, but I simply cannot understand why we have 2 seperate stickies simply confusing the issue.     
All gigs posted here will be in Switzerland, most will be in Zurich, why is it so hard to not have a single thread with a title that accurately reflects the contents ""Upcoming Concerts"" or some such, then acts will be picked up by all who might not otherwise consider a trip out of town.  Instead we have 2 threads, or one thread with an inaccurate title.
		 
			
			Now that 50% of the dissenters have annoyed themselves, can we move to the next part of this thread cycle please?   
Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism -> thread users discuss thread -> long period of silence -> thread users think it safe -> Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism ->
		 
			
			Er, I support the use of the Concerts Calendar - which should be merged with the main calendar IMO; let's have a huge 'What's On' section with overview - rather than having lots of different threads.   
There was some arcane rule about not posting an event on the calendar if you weren't intending to attend; surely that's not necessary? Should there be a concert, is it not easier to have it on the calendar? One concert has no relevence to any other and threads like this spin outta control... although something is better than nothing.   
And it's Zürchers, not Zürichers       Oh yes, above it all aren't we? but can't possibly post to a concerts thread without Zurich being in the title.
		 
			
			right i have to dash off to catch a flight very shortly but as an interim would it make everyone happy if I merge this thread with the Switzerland Gig Guide thread and just have the one thread from now on    
The Zurich guide i really don't think was created intentionally to p!ss off Cyrus and Martin but it seems to have done anyway and I think they'll be banging on about it until the cows come home, so I'll merge and we'll just have one generic thread - which will eliminate their the 'them and us' belief   
Agreed?
		 
			
			Right threads merged - it's all a bit of a jumble - i will attempt to edit it when i get chance
		 
			
			I was going to post earlier, but it felt a little childish   
For fans of electro pop, the excellent   are coming to CH   
Stall 6, Zurich, 2/6 and 
Volkshaus, Basel on 3/6
		    Can I now be picky and ask for it to be renamed ""Switzerland Gigs ""Heads Up"" or ""Switzerland Gigs Discussion"" or ""Switzerland Rough Gig Guide""? Cos it aint a gig guide.
		    ah it could have gone in the other thread    
			
			eskimo joe(super aussie band) are playing Bier Huebli in Bern on the 27th October.             
I'm going. anyone from Zurich feel like grabbing a train to Bern check them out?   
(to avoid a sh!t fight based re: the usual argument: Zurich vs rest of the known universe, if someone feels like popping this on the gig-calendar please feel free. i don't know how. :-) )   
they will also be at Gurten for those who are going   
cheers

That'll be a pint, please.
		 
			
			thanks UM.

			Heard a rumour the amazing Not The Sensational Alex Harvey Band will play in ETH StuZ this September. Not to be missed!
		 
			
			MUSE playing the Hallenstadion in Zurich - Nov 18th... 
Tickets on sale as of today       You've made my day!
		 
			
			B*llocks only seating left!!
		 
			
			Yeah, I think that its because you were only allowed to buy the tickets when they were released if you were a VIP member of ticketcorner.com. Totally sucks as now all the 'ticket dregs' are left. Anyhow, I managed to buy 2 tickets for the UK so will be seeing them there.    
			
			Someone wants to come?           
Thats gonna be my first concert here! Great start    
			
			I wouldn't mind going to see Gossip tonight at Kaufleuten, but they sold out at starticket, does anyone know if they sell tickets on the door?   
I don't want to travel all the way to Zurich and find I can't get in.
		 
			
			A bit short notice but, tonight I can completely recommend both of the bands that will be playing in the restaurant, if it rains, or just outside on the terrace if it doesn't, at the Rote Fabrik. The bands are, in no particular order, Sein and Attwenga. 
Thankyou for your time.
		    5th Dec 09    
			
			Wilco play the Volkshaus on November 11th, tickets from CHF55.-   
Peaches plays 8th September, from CHF55.-   
Goran Bregovic also plays there 23rd April, 2010 ( ) from CHF65.-
		    play the Club at the Theater Spektakel in Zürich Tuesday 18th August, bringing some spooky Ethiopean jazz grooves to the shores of the lake of Zurich. If you weren't in Addis Ababa before 1974, you'll know their music from the Jim Jarmusch film 'Broken Flowers'    
Fire        
			
			This used to work much better when it was a single thread called Zurich Gig Guide 2009 in social events.                      play the Mascotte in Zurich again on December 5th. They're also supporting Muse at the Hallenstadion on November 18th. A good show       It doesn't work because you aren't using the system correctly.
		 
			
			Martin he is using the system how he would like to use it - please quit with groans because someone disagrees with you.   
There are many who no longer benefit from the new system me included - I know a lot of time and effort went into creating the concerts calendar but i feel it is not as effective as the handy gig guide thread we had before. I am finding out about less gigs now because people are just not posting them. It's quick and easy to post on here and many people are short of time and don't wish to create an event.   
So please, we know you don't like this method, but we don't like the other method so can we be grown up and not groan the users who would like to carry on down this route?   
Bannahead thanks for those 3 updates - I am sure in the old system these would have been announced sooner so I hope there are still tickets left for Temper Trap   
Cheers  
Nicky
		    ...It's not that we don't wish to creat an event, but we're following previous rules asking us not to create events if we don't intend / sure if we're going. This is a ""Heads Up"" thread.   
On that note, the rather loud and rocking  play the Rote Fabrik this coming Sunday 20th. Last time they played there were about 7 people in the Ziegel; one was a waiter, one at the bar, two groupies and me and my two mates   A private party!    
There're really quite good, despite the crowds...
		    I agree UM this is why i don't use this calendar event because a) I am unsociable and don't want a crowd tagging along with me at a gig   and b) sometimes I find out about a gig want to tell others but may not be going myself   
I just don't want to get into the whole gigs head up guide v concerts calendar debate again - there was no happy outcome the last time so why can't each person just do as they wish and post a gig ho they want?    
I like this method and it worked for many years and was updated regularly - at least 2 to 3 times a week a new gig would be posted on here and it was always my most favourote thread, it's now died a death and it's a shame    
			
			I haven't posted because I haven't seen anything I liked, it's been quiet over summer.   
Here's a couple to get the thread started again.   
25.10 Micachu and the Shapes / The Invisibles, Zukunft, Zurich   
12.11 Passion Pit, Alte Borse, Zurich   
20.11 The Field, Palace, St. Gallen   
25.11 Massive Attack, Eishalle Deutweg Winterthur   
3.12 Punks Jump Up, Hive, Zurich   
5.12 The Heavy, Palace, St. Gallen
		 
			
			Massive Attack, even antisocial me might be interested in that.       And where do I fit in to that description? I'm still fearful of crossing paths with the FOTL boys after the death look they gave me for buying a bottle of wine at the counter, it was for DaveA I tells ya! Don't think we'll see the likes of a FOTL & Black Mountain ""restaurant"" gig again soon   
Anyways here is my heads up, El Lokal to the rescue in October with varying shades of classy Americana in one hell of a week:   
Oct 18 - Mark Eitzel (American Music Club) 
Oct 22 - Joseph Arthur (last time I saw him was supporting R.E.M.) 
Oct 25 - Richmond Fontaine (Uncut Magazine's favourite story tellers)
		    Oh boy oh boy, Good work, El Lokal       Palace in St Gallen is a very good venue. Dont be scared to stand in front of the ""seat"" people though.        This is your opinion. And you are wrong.   
Along with Nicky, I do not want to reopen the whole Zurich Gig Guide versus Calendar discussion because it got boring very quickly. However, I will not be posting any events         
Sadly I won't be able to attend The XX gig and I am mightily disappointed.
		     
I like the recent albums but I'm not sure how it will work live.
		 
			
			Camera Obscura - 13th Oct - Abart, Zurich   
White Lies - 14th Nov - Kaufleuten, Zurich
		 
			
			Someone here on EF is nutty for them if remember correctly....   
Ultravox - Volkshaus Zurich - 15 April 2010   
with Midge Ure back up front.
		 
			
			It's a good week for indie music in Zürich with Au Revoir Simone on Tuesday and Yacht last night (which was great!).   
This evening Girls are playing at Exil.   
They have an interesting personal history, having grown up in the Children of God cult, being heavily involved with drugs and being adopted by a billionaire . . . or something.   
The music is psychedelic, influenced by the Beach Boys and shoegaze.
		 
			
			Who are the ""Girls"" ?     
as you can imagine, googling is pointless ... what do I google? Girls in Zurich, Girls group, Girls music ...
		 
			
			Anyone interested in seeing Alice In Chains in Fribourg start of december?   
A bit of a different band from their Grunge days, could be interesting
		    Well I did explain a little bit in my original post . . .   
More here:          If only I noticed earlier      
The debut album - imaginatively titled Album - is in the post   
Did you go? Were they good?       
And now for a plug          Unfortunately they started at 11.30 which was a bit late for a school night, so I decided against it.   
In other news . . . Patrick Wolf is playing at Mascotte on Wednesday. Anyone going? Or want to go? If you are it would be nice to meet up . . . PM me.       
			
			FYI - for any Aussies out there Eskimo Joe is playing tonight in Bern at the Bier Huebli           
cheers   
Nic
		 
			
			It would seem that The Joy Formidable are supporting The Temper Trap.   
Check out the video here      
How can you not love this band.
		 
			
			for the U2 fans out there, heard that they'll be playing in zurich next summer... can anyone confirm?
		   I'm looking forward to see KING AUTOMATIC at the longstreet bar 4.11.09 @2100h
Now that is something worth going to see..       I watched their video, what a bunch of w@nkers!
		    Not definitively but I can say the stage diagrams /architect plans have been drawn up (see  ), permission for a concert at Dubendorf Airfield has been granted, and I would expect a concert date sometime in the first half of September 2010 to be announced in the next week or two.
		 
			
			...are playing at the Volkhaus on 28.01.10...(I know I know, that's ages away, but being in CH...)   
I think tickets are around CHF50 , but you'll get excellent riffage for your frank, and the support is sure to be good....       
You know it makes sense!
		 
			
			Looking forward to the Temper trap in a few weeks. Got a few mates coming. Anyone interested in meeting up, PM me
		 
			
			Ian Brown is playing at Abart in Zurich on the 18th January. Tickets are now available.   
Should be a great gig if he manages to keep out of trouble with the dibble between now and then.
		 
			
			I just hope that he doesn't get bottled like  the last time he played Rohstofflager.   
Ian went offstage for a break, the roadies were switching out the Fender guitars and bringing the Gretsches onstage. This suggests the likelihood of an encore filled with Stone Roses songs. He wasn't offstage for more than 3 minutes and the idiots behind started throwing filled cups of beer towards the stage, coating us in the front row and the instruments on stage. They were asked to stop, but the continued. The lights came on the, the roadies got all the gear off stage and the Ian didn't come back on to play an encore that would have included a bunch of Roses tracks   , (as indicated on the setlist i collected)   
I really hope the Abart crowd are a bit more sensible.               is playing at the Salzhaus in Winterthur on Sunday, 22 Nov 2009   
And me sadly up in Germany...
		 
			
			The Living End - Aussie pub rock   
Monday 23 Nov Abart Zurich.   
Any interest?             
			
			Scout Niblett's at Abart on at Exil on December 3rd.   
Dinosaur Egg!
		    will be there with the missus and some mates   
went to high school with these guys       At Abart or Exil?   Put the gin bottle down, man.
		    Naughty Hendricks!   
It'sh Exil . . .       
			
			for those going to Temper Trap on the 2nd Dec - the venue has been changed to the Abart
		 
			
			Living End - what a gig man!!!    
AWESOME !!
		    YEA - it was an amazing show!!! And I liked how the venue was really stretched to it's limit, with a crowd surfer almost kicking down a ceiling-mounted stage light and with the bass literally lifting the roof      
best CHF36 I ever spent in Switzerland    
			
			A great venue for a great Band:   
Stereophonics.  
09.02.2010.  
Palais Xtra. ZH
		 
			
			The Temper Trap is playing at Abart Zurich on 2nd. December. 
Is anyone going as well?
		 
			
			Wow just listened to some Youtube vids (Science of Fear, Sweet Disposition and Fader) and they are pretty damn awesome, in fact very awesome, I really like the sound.   
Abart is 50m from my apartment too. Very tempted, will talk to my friend and look at tickets tommorrow. Thanks for the heads-up man.    
			
			You're welcome. Love Abart as it's a smaller venue AND it has a Bar    
			
			got the tickets as soon as i saw they are in CH. really looking forward to seeing them..
		 
			
			Also already secured my tickets for Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten on 22. February. He's amazing live and it will sell-out really fast. Just to give everyone the head's up.      Same here. Should be rad.    
And yep Xaiver Rudd is a go-a in December. Will bet tickets asap
		 
			
			I'll be there at Temper trap - looking forward to it - shame they changed the venue though
		    Thanks for the heads up...I would've turned up at hafenkneipe blissfully unaware that they had changed the venue otherwise. Oh well, bang goes my 3 minute walk...   
Should be an awesome gig though, can't wait to see them live.
		    ...and bang it goes to Richdog. Abarte is at the end of my street.    
Really looking forward to the gig, booking tickets tommorrow.       But Xavier Rudd is in February next year not December?
		 
			
			oops my bad. May miss it cause i'll be in Australia either feb or march
		 
			
			Biffy Clyro is playing at Mascotte in Zurich this Saturday. 
Also for those who have missed it, Editors are playing at X-tra in Zurich with support by the Maccabees! Should be a great gig.
		    Its annoying that one,we are booked for the editors,but would have really liked to see Biffy Clyro.
		 
			
			Same here. Difficult choices      me too - they supported Muse but really we were so far away and as usual the sound is rubbish in Hallenstadion and especially for the support acts. Would have been good to see them in a smaller venue   
see you Sat Mrs O
		 
			
			see you in the bar.
		 
			
			Just seen Filastine is playing at exil in Zurich tomorrow (Friday).  Think that might be mighty interesting.
		     
4th February   at abart   
10th March   at rohstofflager
		    She must have liked it here last time!
		 
			
			David Grey for anyone interested   
X-tra 7th Feb
		    I missed both these on their first visit, hopefully get to see them both on their second
		    Cool i might be keen for that
		 
			
			Gentleman & the Evolution are playing at Maag Event Hall in Zurich on 20th April 2010. Bit far off but tickets will sell fast.    
Gentleman is pretty amazing live!
		 
			
			John Butler Trio coming April 25th 2010 at Maag MusicHall AG  
unfortunately i'll be on a plane to Oz then    
Venue phone: 044 444 26 26.

			Jase you just made my day!   
I love John Butler Trio, saw them live at Gurten Festival.  
Will get my tickets asap     
Another heads up:   
RJD2 is playing in Bern in May.       
			
			12 March, Zurich, Volkshaus -    bringing his upcoming   work.   
Brothers and sisters in true music, this gig is a keeper of keepers.  I have heard some tasters from the CD, read reviews from in the know people who I trust with their musical opinions, and it promises to be a deep human  , esp. in these obtuse times on the planet earth.  And believe me I have seen Pat Metheny many times (more than any other artist perhaps including Joe Zawinul in the same company) since 1978, so this is full-hearted endorsement.   
If you saw   tour of 1992, and   in 2005, then this tour has the potential to outpass these two extra dimensional gigs.  Metheny is a musician/composer/human being for our times and for all times.   
Here's a neat interview with Metheny       Is RJD2 playing his low tech hip hop stuff (ie. since we last spoke/Dead ringer) or his indie singer-songwriter stuff? cause im not so found of his new direction.   
Edit: Also keen to check out DJ Vadim on Feb 5th if anyones going
		 
			
			Jose james, Kaufleuten Zurich 10th March.

			Dans le sac vs Scroobius pip play at Sudpol, Luzern 28th Jan.       
For those of you who haven't heard of them before, well worth a listen.    
There are also sections of spoken word from ""Scroobius pip""        
tickets are only 30.00   
Should be a great show
		    They played at Hafenkneipe in Zürich last year.  They must like it here.

I have tickets for the great Element Of Crime next week but i heard its sold out.
		 
			
			Hey people   
sorry for the last minute question, but is anyone going to the concert of Angélique Kidjo in Kaufleuten on Saturday? I'll be there with 2 friends and thought it would be a good ocassion to meet some of you     =   
All the best

Although it's on a Monday  , I'll definitely see her       will be in Zurich (Kaufleuten) on Tuesday, the  !   
Would love to see her... too bad that it's so far and on a Tuesday       will take place from the 7th to the 10th of April in Crans Montana (Valais).   
The program is available here:       
I've never been so far but I might go there on the Friday evening.   and   should be interesting.       I love air but not sure how much tickets are. I thought theyd be expensive because they're crazy popular in Australia
		 
			
			Btw: Does anyone know where I can get tickets to the Stall6 gigs? Im trying to find DJ Vadim tickets online but it seems to be the biggest run around
		    I think you can just email   to reserve tickets . . .
		 
			
			cheers mate
		 
			
			The Blood Arm are playing in Albani Club, Winterthur on 23rd Feb and Bar 59, Luzern 24th. I have seen this band twice in London, and they put on the most entertaining shows of any band I have ever seen.    
Go see them!   
(And if anybody is going to be driving to either one from the Grindelwald area, please let me know...)       Great!!! I'll be there...  Tickets available at:    
(40chf  )
		    Bar 59 is a cool little spot, might go check them out.     
La Roux is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, on the 7th March.
		    Damn, apparently it's sold out.  Anyone want rid of their tickets?
		    Do Kaufleuten normally have additional tickets on the door?
		    Don't know, but would like to find out.
		 
			
			More gigs I would like to go to (but need to work out if I can get back from Zurich on a school night  ):   
Hockey 16 Feb 10 Abart     
Vampire Weekend, May 28 2008   Zurich <-- so errr ignore that, as it's way out of date (Thanks bananahead for spotting!)
		     
Hey Kirsty, you do realise that it is 2010 this year?                 
But they were good    
			
			hmm thanks for pointing out my stupidity... but I would have liked to go! This was my vain search for bands I really like playing in Switzerland, and I turned up... 2   And one of those was 2 years ago! (It said past performances in teeny tiny writing - you can't blame me for getting over excited and missing that!)   
Harumph, so just hockey then...
		     
Hi there, 
You can buy them in Ticket corner,  they are 60.60 CHF general entrance, 
it is not that expensive. 
Are you going? 
Alex
		    The missus might be sorting tickets atm. Will let you know if we are
		    Hockey is ausverkauf.   
I'm not sure if they will have tickets on the door at Abart.

			Kitsuné faves Two Door Cinema Club are playing on January 27th at Ziegel au Lac.       
			
			Coming 27 Jan to the D! Club,   - the one and the only   for a  !!!!  Can not make it for professional commitments in other parts of the continent, but it promises to be da BOMBE.  Such a precocious talent.  A voice and presence        
Check out this clip from 1995 in London.  Whatever you do please stay in your seat...........!!!!!!!!!!       
			
			infected mushroom are playing feb 13 @      
they always seem to be changing style, better than being stagnant I guess, and I'll probably go check it out
		     
I thought he went by the name of Senanda Maitreye these days?   
P.S to save others searching the D Club location as I just did   it's in Lausanne
		 
			
			As a heads up, we actually have a concerts calendar as an option on the main forum calendar. It's somewhat lost because one has to scroll down and change the options to see it - we're working on simplifying this - but  anyway. As these lists get longer and longer, perhaps it'd be useful for others to know from the calendar if you're intending to go. It'll allow a bit of buzz for the event and let others know who's attending.
		     
Nicky, he sure has but thought to put his former name out to those who remember him from 1987 when he came out with  rby album, and several others after until he changed his name to Sananda Maitreya in 2001.   
My bad, I put Lausanne in the Title block but not in the main text!   
Anybody been to the D! Club in, of course, Lausanne?   
			
			Terrence Trent Darby used to be on my wall as a teenager, would love to see him if he did his hold stuff, alas Lausanne a bit too far..
		 
			
			I think I might go to this.    
Will just have to stay up all night and get the first train home  .
		 
			
			Nicky n Natasha   
I think he will play some of the older charts and newer ones too.   
Maybe he is on tour and coming to your area?  I had no idea about this Lausanne gig until I read it in   this Saturday morning.   
Or if you would like a very nice youth hostel near the lake in Lausanne here it is.  Highly recommended and very reasonably priced.  Think 39 chf room with breakfast       
			
			Recently discovered  covering concerts in Switzerland (landlockedblues). May be of interest to see who's around and get the er, skinny. (Is that right? Skinny? Is that still in?)

			The White Lies gig for tonight has been cancelled.   
""Dearest fans. Charles from White Lies here. Im am so so sorry to say that we have to cancel tomorrows show in Munich and the following day in Zurich because Harry has picked up a very nasty viral infection which has destroyed his voice. He's seen doctors from various parts of Europe over the last few days and overdosed on every steroid/anti-inflamatory and pain-killer we could get hold of. But it hasn't worked and today we had to come off stage in Vienna after only 3 songs. We're so sad to have to re-schedule these two shows once again. We had been looking forward to them since December. Please be assured that we will still play these shows for you as soon as we finish the next album and by then have exclusive new songs for you. Love from us all. C W/L""       
(Credit to Dan for spotting this!)
		   are playing at Moods in Zürich as part of the M4Music festival. Saturday, 27th March at 23.00   
Goody goody
		 
			
			anyone going to Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten tonight?
		    A definite Yes!!!       Me, too, me too!
		    Hadouken are a good live act. Noisy fun.   
Very polite young chaps too.   
Here are some photos I took when I saw them in London in 2008:           
			
			Eminem, Jay-Z, Fantastischen Vier, Jan Delay, Stress,...whole bunch others:   
Frauenfeld-weekend of the 9th July.
		 
			
			Gogol Bordello on May 26th in Zurich:       
I unfortunately will be out of town.  
I've seen them once before in concert and they are absolutely amazing....
		 
			
			Faithless are coming to Zurich!    
April 27th at Vilkshaus       
			
			R Kelly will be in Basel the 3rd of April:          Lock up your 15 year old daughters!    
			
			Right, bought my John Butler Trio Tickets for 25th April. 
Can't wait!! Anyone know who support band is?
		 
			
			Benga comes to Bern on the 3rd of April at Reitschule.   
Haven't yet been to a pure dubstep night, this seems like one to go for.  Might be my first night out in Bern too.
		 
			
			Mos Def 24th April at Rote Fabrik. Have put an event in the  .
		 
			
			The Reverend Horton Heat (USA),  Fr 02.04.2010, Zurich       
highly recommended. i've seen them 3 times and if it were not for the concert being in zurich, i'd be there again.    
			
			Damn, sometime I miss living in Zurich...Les Claypool at the Abart club on 10 March.        
			
			Pink Martini a the Kaufleuten 15th July     
			
			and Cat Empire at Schutzenhaus Uetliberg, Zürich           
I guess the title of his tour (""Ladies make some noise"") tells it all    
			
			An hip hop event during Easter in Zurich. It will be the fisrt edition.   
Method Man, The Beatnuts, De la Soul, IAM, Diam's, Hocus Pocus and more performing between the 2nd of April and the 4th of April.             
Imogen Heap is playing tommorow night at Abart, I think tickets are still available.   
			
			I almost bought tickets for      =   
but I'm not sure.    
Opinion anyone?
		 
			
			Posting on behalf of a friend of mine, he organises Stoner rock bands to come over here.  Rock isn't normally my thing but I've hugely enjoyed every concert he put on.   
Locations are either Sedel or the Blues Bar, both in Luzern.  Sedel is the old womens prison, just outside of town, Blues Bar is a tiny room at the back of a latin nightclub, just past schuur.               
			
			Ash are playing Abart on 25th May     
Last time I went to see them was at the University of London Union...seem to remember the night ended up with me drinking Snakebite and Blacks, whilst arm wrestling students...not quite had a similar experience in Switzerland so far...
		 
			
			The Strokes, Stone Temple Pilots, Billy Talent, LCD Soundsystem, NOFX, Wolfmother, 30 Seconds to Mars, White Lies, Kasabian:   
24-27 June, St Gallen.   
Gonna be a rough weekend!
		    Yeah . . . especially without any decent bands        
*GROAN*   
sorry DJ Bobo wasn't available, he's kinda hard to get a hold of this time of the year
		    Well, I'd probably give LCD Soundsystem the time of day . . .   
And I note that The Strokes have a new album out in 2010.   
Not the freshest line up though, is it?
		 
			
			Yeah, I'm really going for the Strokes and STP (and I have a gulity pleasure for Billy Talent too, but I'm in therapy for it).   
The rest will just be cool filler, perhaps some surprises.
		 
			
			Huge Euro festivals suck. Small festivals suck harder. It's all a big con to get us to consume more product. Bring back touring.
		    What you want is small 'conference' festivals in towns:  SXSW, Stag and Dagger, The Great Escape
		    What I want is a seven foot blond chick with natural curves and green eyes who'll turn into a pizza at 3am, but I appreciate your sentiment.
		    Certain to be available at all the above events, if you do them right.
		    Ahhh I saw Ash at the Astoria last year. It was great. I will try and get along to this one. It's a school night though    
Happy memories of ULU... They used to do the best nachos to go with your snakebite!
		 
			
			I've seen Ash 3 or 4 times at various stages of their career and they have yet to be less than awesome   Best time was in a little venue in Hastings and Silver Sun were the support.   
Ah, Silver Sun - their debut album was fantastic!!
		 
			
			Saxon - Z7 - Thursdsay night.
		 
			
			Blood Red Shoes at Abart on March 29th          Indeed           
Looking forward to it lots.
		    please tell your friend to send some of these bands to lausanne...      concert cancelled !!!
		 
			
			The Moon and Stars' festival (in Locarno) programme is available:       
Too bad that Locarno is that far!!!   
I hope that JK will give another concert elswhere in Switzerland       Would go to see LCD, STP and Wolfmo but the FREAKIN World Cup is on, priorities priorities.    
I see the Gurten has Faith No More headlining - enough said. Wont be going to see that rubbish again.
		    They'll be showing all the matches from big screens so it won't be that you'll have to miss anything....btw Mike Patton is GOD!
		    To be honest its the WorldCup, I need to be comfortable when Im watching the Greatest Show on Earth!   
Hmmm MP is a deity huh... The Real Thing is their seminal album granted, in fact I still regularly listen to it, but their material got progressively Pattonised (weird and experimental in want of actual music) culminating in the God awful Mr Bungle. Discuss...
		     
I don't know how I can discuss such ignorance politely    
Different strokes I suppose and if you prefer the Mike Patton that sings Lionel Richie covers then so be it... I guess I couldn't interest you in his work with John Zorn then       No need to be polite, we are discussing Patton after all. Angel Dust was after The Real Thing, and about the time I started to loose interest. Jizzlobber was the last straw. Terrible.
		 
			
			I for one am stoked to see FNM headlining the Gurten Festival!!!    
btw...   
epic < angel dust < king for a day < album  of the year   
tomahawk is also awesome.   
peeping tom is really good too.    
mr bungle and fantomas are acquired tastes but absolutely incredible live.
		     
what's a world cup?         
Sorry, not my thing
		    Unfortunately this world cup is not played with sticks so guess your national team didnt qualify, u could always support the USA       He does a great job, I'll post them up in events shortly, but if you'e a big fan of any of the bands, it'd worth the trip to Luzern.  Both venues are very small and you get right up close to the band.
		 
			
			Soccer world cup? I know what id rather do..... Anything. But then again I'll watch anything when im loaded   
Anyone going to this M4 music thingo tomorrow? Keen to see Jose Gonzalez again. Last time I saw him the sound was awful and it was a horrible setup
		    Jeff Beck!
		    yeah but in support of ZZ Top? ewww....      
but i will say tho that Jeff Beck was amazing at Montreux Jazz Festival a couple years ago. probably my favorite guitarist evah!    
			
			FYI Paleo Festival has announced their lineup....meh           
besides Iggy & the Stooges & Indochine... meh indeed
		    Two Door Cinema Club and We Have Band are worth seeing.   
Foals are very definitely worth seeing . . . amazing live performers.  Klaxons too.   
I'll happily dance to Vitalic and Yuksek.   
N*E*R*D pretty good live too.
		    So I can see what snazzy dressers they are? Sorry, generic ""indie"" music bores me nowadays. Good point about N.E.R.D. & Vitalic though.
		    There's a big difference between TDCC and something like Coldplay or the Kooks.  There's electronica and afro-pop in there.  Yes, they're snappy dressers, but that's part of the deal if you sign to Kitsuné.  Not sure how they'd come across on a festival stage though.
		     
Which they stole from Vampire Weekend, who stole it from Paul Simon, who stole it from Fela Kuti. Shame he's dead now...
		    . . .  who stole it from someone else in Africa . . . etc etc blah blah blah   
You think there's a chance of completely ahistoric music with no antecedents?  And that bands shouldn't use some of the same sounds and influences?  TTCM fall some way in between Vampire Weekend and Foals, but have their own sound.  Vampire Weekend are more preppy/New England.  Foals miss out the Afro-pop, but have some of the same kind of indie-dance and free range guitar.
		    meh indeed
		   26.05.2010: Foals @ Abart, Zurich  
Tickets are available from    
			
			Port O'Brien playing in Zurich, Basel and Luzern this weekend. I have seen them in Dublin before and they were great live! Recommend.   
Hopefully they will still make it despite volcano issues!
		 
			
			Stevie Wonder at Moon and Stars on 7th July.
		 
			
			Crystal Castles at rohstofflager, Zürich on the 27th April, might try and make that.
		    play the Idaplatzfest in Zurich, 21st August, showcasing their second album      Perhaps      playing this Friday night at 8pm at Kaufleuten Zurich.
		 
			
			Not sure if it's already pegged in here, but The Eels are playing in Winterthur on August 28th, supported by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  Tix are 54 CHF from Starticket.   
Also the night before, Paolo Nutini is playing the same spot.   
Looks like an open air music week in old town Winterthur, should be cool. (Events already created for both in the Concerts calendar)
		 
			
			I've created a social event in the calendar for the Tunng gig on Wednesday.
		 
			
			this looks promising:        
at least for friday night.       What is it about the Swiss and Skunk Ananse?? 
Every other country got tired of them in weeks!   
The Eels looks promising!
		     
When you figure that out please explain to me their fascination with Amy Macdonald.   
It's just Eels btw, no ""the""
		     Cool, miss living there.
		    Anyone fancy it, or already going?
		    Er . . . that was last night wasn't it?
		    May, no?   
(too short)
		    Ooops . . .  I am living in the future!     (Yes . . . there are flying cars here and everything)   
			
			This looks good, an open-air festival for Zurich at long last.  i'll be there for Underworld and Booka Shade.  I'll try for Placebo but tradition dictates I turn up right at the end of their encore...          I've posted an event for this:       
			
			Bump for the Tindersticks playing at Kaufleuten tonight. Anyone else in?
		 
			
			Jimi Tenor and Tony Allen at the Kaserne tonight (8/5/10). Tony Allen was the band leader for Fela Kuti, but his solo stuff since then is less of the traditional afrobeat. Fans of experimental rock and jazz should check it out!
		 
			
			They obviously like it here     
mo. 29.11. -  - abart
		   Mike Patton's Mondo Cane   Thursday , 29.07.2010   20h00  Luzern (CH)  KKL Luzern - Konzertsaal    
			
			A.R Rahman concert 
Hallenstadion Zurich 
16 July        thanks for posting. that would be a VERY interesting show to see.    
but it seems like most concert announcements just make me realize i'm on the wrong side of switzerland.       Foals were amazing last night.  Tracks from the second album are generally more contemplative than those from the first and therefore less appropriate for a live performance.  The old/new split was about 70/30.  It's just incredible the way the band plays together . . . precise but intensely passionate.  Many times throughout the gig I just went 'wow'.  The final song, 'One Step, Two Step' left the crowd on a high.
		 
			
			not sure if anyone has posted it yet, but Slash is touring his new album in June. He's playing X-tra on the 16th of June. Miles Kennedy is on vocal duties.   
from what i've read they are playing a healthy mix of tracks from Slashs' back catalogue and the new stuff.  i'm really looking forward to this one.           
			
			Another overlooked festival, just saw a poster for it...Neuchatel Open Air.   
Cypress Hill! Looks like a nice location too.        
			
			What about the   in Lucerne   
Shame about the name.... I think its for the sexually frustrated
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this but....      - Abart, Monday 5th July, CHF35   
Fo sho!
		    Oh how gutted i was to hear this was on the 5th July, the day i go on holiday! VERY gutted
		    damn have my mother here from Oz that week. Might take her with us    
			
			Almost missed this one, John Garcia plays Kyuss at Schuur tonight (2nd June), Luzern.
		 
			
			i'm going to see them tomorrow in lausanne. i didn't bother posting coz i really didn't think there was anyone here interested.   
should i also mention baroness is playing in fribourg in july? my new favorite band.    
			
			A band I know will be playing Thu, June 10 in Stall 6. 
African Percussions and a singer from Gambia. 
P-Train & Lamine Jobarteh.   
CHF 10.-            
			
			The Kissaway Trail the highlight (for me) of this year's For Noise festival in Pully (near Lausanne).       
			
			I'm surprised no one has mentioned Prince in Geneva on 12 July.        
			
			Not sure if this has already been mentioned   
29th Sept Hallenstadion    
I am so there!   
Tickets for ticket corner members went on sale today, general public tomorrow I think, many pre sales tickets already sold out so get up early tomorrow folks    
			
			Say what now? I thought I knew you! interwebz-wise.       stick with me Debz and i'll show you the way    
come on who can not be a Peter Gabriel fan?
		             
anyone born after 1980       Phil Collins fans?
		 
			
			anyone coming to Bsides festival today?
		 
			
			Possibly, keeping an eye on the weather.
		    Damn . . . didn't spot that.  Not sure if I can come now.   
Three Trapped Tigers are excellent.
		 
			
			Hmmmm . . . Crystal Fighters are playing at the Imagine Festival in Basel tomorrow.       
Am I right in thinking this is free?   
Anyone else going?
		     
it is free, might be going.
		 
			
			I've already booked and paid for my Guns n Roses tickets.   
Geneva, 16th September at the Arena (beside the Airport)
		 
			
			I'm probably a bit slow off the mark, but Mumford and Sons are playing (with Sophie Hunger) the Montreux JF on 14th July. Tickets are note available on the ticketcorner site but, unlike other, it is not marked as sold out on the Montreux site.   
I'm also very tempted by Julian Casablancas with Vampire Weekend but at 80.- it's a bit steep. There are tickets available for that though.   
Does anyone know where else I might be able to get tickets? I can get to Montreux to buy them next week if this is necessary...   
Merci d'avance!
		 
			
			More rock at Sedel, Luzern.   
July 2nd 
Yawning Man   
July 4th 
Mondo Generator   
July 8th 
Valient Thorr
		 
			
			Devendra Banhart is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, Tuesday July 13th. Tickets from        
			
			Its not a Swiss gig so please don't shoot me down but we are off Wed to Belgium to what I reckon is the BEST open air festival in the world.....   
Werchter Festival is so damn well organised and has a solid line up every year. Just 8 hours drive. You can't beat it peoples.   
ROCKONAUSTRALIA !!!        decent festival but Primavera destroys all
		 
			
			careful with your ears, folks.    
my last concert, john garcia plays kyuss, might be my last concert.    
since then, i have tinnitus. BAD. this sucks.    
i will post up some tinnitus info at some point but please take care of your ears.   
/sweet blog
		    Nice!  I may have to think about this... haven't had my fill of weird yet this year.    One of my all-time favorites:   
[maybe this should be in song of the day...]   
But on a Tuesday?!? Come on!   
EDIT: Anyone here planning to go?  I am so up for it but pretty sure my roomie wouldn't be interested...
		 
			
			Baby was a black sheep, baby was a whore. Baby got big but she's gonna get bigger..... Anyone going to see Patti Smith in the Rote Fabrik on Wednesday? 
I really hope she only plays old songs, but it's not too far to walk home if she does.
		 
			
			here's an 'under-the-radar' festival...in grandson VD...          Oh man, missed that and probably can't go now.   
Love this song:       
			
			It'll be outside, on the lakeside, so you could in theory, come watch the football, outside, and listen to her in the background. It's going to be quite a night! I'll be up on the roof!        I really should be but the devil on my left shoulder told me to go watch football instead.
		 
			
			Rodney Branigan at the Cava.....     
			
			anyone interested in Baroness at Bad Bonn (Düdingen), 13 July? I got some super dooper expensive earplugs to try out.        
			
			Patti was legendary. The lake was magnificent, and Germany lost. Was that the perfect night?        crap i just saw this! i love patti smith- seen her a ton of times and poetry stuff too... wish i knew i'd have definitely gone...   
i've even got a gorgeous photo of her holding my then 6month old son at a poetry event in nyc... wah. a bit sad now i need to keep up on these things...   
			
			I want to be half that cool when I'm 62!       I would have loved to have gone , but I got the feeling that you would have got the weird Patti doing performance art versions of stuff, rather than the angry Horses version ... 
If it was the later then I wish I had gone !
		    was incredible.                
			
			T'was the latter. I expected a post-menapausal, I know it all and I'm gonna pass on the word Patti, but she rocked! Right up til her final song, which was rock and roll nigga. Having said that, she didn't actually do horses.     
			
			The Coral are playing Abart on November 2nd   
Should be a really good gig and tickets are only 35CHF       
			
			Mike Patton fans- Mondo Cane will be in Lucerne the 29th at the  .

          30.11.             (usa) &    (uk)   
sif you would go to Helmet. ffs its HELMET!!!!
		     
almost word for word what a friend said to me when he saw that    
Xiu Xiu in St Gallen in November..
		 
			
			ooh, i'd like to see those Drums in action.  (is the day before my birthday too, sounds like a good excuse for a big friday night)   
i'd be interested in seeing kate nash covered in whipped cream and lip-synching too, but only for laughs             A very good excuse indeed! It would be nice to see you there ... I've got my ticket ...      Yep, I agree, only for laughs, but as I do not like the location, I most probably skip that one.
		 
			
			i have just been informed that the Scissor Sisters are playing the on the 15th of November.          HELL YEAH!    
but that's a looong drive for a tuesday night.      
holy crap! after a quick search they are playing in Yverdon on Dec 1st. STOKED!
		    hope they are better than when they were at hallenstadion, worst gig in my history of gigs and i only had to endure half of it
		    I'll buy ya a beer, so take the train    
			
			02.12.2010 gossip @ x-tra, zurich 
info:   (german)
		 
			
			I see Booker T is playing  tomorrow (21st July). Rather peeved to only spot this now, plus to have to miss it due to soccerball.
		    wish i could. you're very lucky to have the abart. when i lived in zurich, i only saw 3 concerts there (in 3 years) due to working so much and just being out of the loop. recently i went and looked at the history of who has been there since i left in 2001 and thought i was gonna be sick.    
king's x at the abart was one of my favoritist shows ever.    
			
			Here's a few gigs that might be of interest in the ""near"" future:   
Pendulum 30/09 Xtra CHF45   
Goldfrapp 05/10 Xtra CHF60   
The Coral 02/11 Abart CH37   
Carl Barat (The Libertines, Dirty Pretty Things) 09/11 Mascotte CHF46   
Caribou 09/11 Abart CHF37

The Drums 19/11 Abart CHF43   
Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan 26/11 Kaufleuten CHF48   
Blood Red Shoes 29/11 Abart CHF35     Sorry for any repeats!   
			
			Pendulum, oh boy, might have to get in early on that one..
		 
			
			Kap Bambino at X-Tra in Zürich this Friday!       
(not sure that's the best of venues though)
		 
			
			It's notable how many bands return to Zürich soon after playing here.  Dan mentioned Blood Red Shoes above, Beach House too.  Do they think it's cool here or is it the strong CHF?   
Here's another returner . . . Au Revoir Simone at Abart on August 23rd, they were good at Stall 6 last September.   
Other acts that may or not be returning:   
Mystery Jets at Abart on 11th October 
Yuck at Hafenkneipe on 3rd November 
Plan B at Kaufleuten on 14th November

Eintritt Frei!
		    Paging Gastro Gnome...that thoroughly nice chap is playing for free    
Sadly I'll be somewhere else...   
Oh, and I assume you mean September instead of October       Funnily enough I've met Gilles a couple of times through a friend.  She was visiting London from Estonia and was a big fan of worldwide.  She went to his club and got chatting to him.  He invited her to his house the next day and sent her off with a load of vinyl . . . she went back to Tallinn and became a DJ.  Nice chap.   
Have I already told you that story before?
		     
nice lil' story which doesn't amaze me all that much. Peterson seems like such a nice bloke at least on the radio show    
I might make the drive out ... Zükunft is such a great little club with an awesome vibe and the woodblock prints for announcing the nights
		    I'm not sure you got to the vinyl bit as those pesky Foals were a playing there thingys awfully loud    
*worldwide worldwide worldwide*
		    Ah yes . . . it's all coming back to me . . .
		 
			
			Is anybody heading to Rote Fabrik on Saturday to see The Maccabees?   
It's free from what i can understand of this-        
I might be if I can get out of prior arrangements
		 
			
			Pink Floyd fans should be headed to Dietikon, ZH Saturday evening 9-18-10:          Brilliant!  Yeah . . . I'd like to go and see them.

			The Morning Benders tonight at Salzhaus Winterthur   
support is the fantastic Sheila She Loves You from Basel
		 
			
			I can't believe I just read about Maccabees now it now. 
They are pretty cool!
		    It was an excellent gig, more so for being free.  We should lobby them to return.
		 
			
			The brilliant band The Wedding Present are playing on the 31 october in the Mariaberg in Rorschach:     
...why Rorschach       And they're playing Bizarro!?!?!?!?!   
Hmmm . . . might have to look at a hotel there . . .
		    Yes might be an option.    
Not doable on public transport as the last train departing towards Zurich leaves at 22.40.   
Why don't they play at the Volkshaus in Zurich like normal bands do?  
Don't get their marketing strategy?!   But then if they ever had a marketing strategy they'd be a world famous band by now.
		    Their biggest marketing push, as far as I remember, was quite perverse and involved releasing a seven inch single for every month of 1992.  I had 'em all, but have somehow lost track of them.       too much apple pie, Tubbs           
I just checked them out - thanks for the tip - I love them!!  Shame they don't have more dates up on their calendar but I will keep an eye out.  Hope there are more bands like them around - gives me hope    
			
			Nothing beats   for finding out what's on. 
You filter by date, price, distance willing to travel, can link to other social sites etc..
		    How do I see everything in Zürich.   
It just came back with this limited selection:        Hmmm . . . I tried registering.   
Does it only show you bands you track?      I've just spent ten minutes getting nothing but frustrated with that site.  I simply want to see what's on in Zürich.  Instead it seems I have to track a load of bands.  Can't I just track Zürich?
		    Don't know if you meant Sheila she loves you or the morning benders but if it was the first they are playing in La Catrina in Zürich tmw evening for   good idea to get there a bit early though as it fills up quickly.
		    They usually play at least 3 times a year in Switz anyhow..
		    Who told you that? The Wedding Present have hardly ever played 3 times a year in Switzerland (if ever).
		    Yes - Shelia she loves you - I won't be in Switzerland until the 11th October but will checking out all the bands and venues.  Do the gigs usually finish in time to catch the last train back from Zurich to Basel?  Here in scotland there are some venues that run 7 to 10 pm and last train is about 11pm but most venues run to midnight or later.
		    Well if you're moving to Basel I'm sure you'll have plenty of chances to see them. Most venues try to finish in time for the last train but it doesn't always work out.
		    Perhaps slightly exaggerated but they do come through quite often. I know for sure they've played Sommercasino in Basel several times.
		     
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finntroll @ Konzertfabrik Z7 - Dec 12!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't know that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank the holy lord that I was browsing this thread!!!!! One of my current favorite Bands of all time... Slightly strange coincidence too.   
So um, anybody else going?    
			
			Black Rebel Motorcycle Club @ Zurich Volkshaus November 14th   
Can find it listed everywhere but can't find tickets yet...
		   , Luzern on the 15th of October, unfortunately I'll miss it as I'm DJ at Bar 59 the same night.
		 
			
			for those in Lausanne. BRMC are also playing at a festival on the 13.11.2010       
can't find Zurich tickets yet either, but i'll be there.

Shellac is playing in Bern on the same day , a bit torn between the two.If he would be singing bad seeds songs it would be easier.
		 
			
			Tell me about it! I'm immersing myself in Grinderman, to get used to it so I won't be too confused on the day. Having said that, they may do a couple of their badseed songs.       
			
			Dollhouse (SWE) play mascotte today (tuesday)- starts around 20h and some norwegian band will open for them.

Bandsintown.com is pretty cool but has some limitations. I'd like to be able to opt out specific locations (like Zurich and anything in France) and it would be cool if you could feed it a list of bands from your music collection. Aside from that a nice utility. A friend told me about something similar that works with your itunes collections, feeds your band names into a database and returns upcoming concerts for bands in your collection plus similar bands.
		    How was the show?      Thank you!   
27th October @            
			
			Not sure if its been mentioned but a band from my home town in Australia are playing on Nov 5. Really Psychedelic but pretty decent the only time ive seen them    
Tame Impala 
Nov 5 @ Mascotte, Zurich
		 
			
			Club night rather than gig: Nu:Tone (Hospital Records)* & Stamina MC are playing at Kaserne, Basel on Sat 23rd Oct:    
Will be heading over from Zurich, anyone else going?   
* UK Drum and Bass producer and DJ
		 
			
			A bit disapointing to be honest. Maybe it was just too early in the tour. Some of it worked, some of it was a disaster. Nick was looking alot like Bunny Munroe.        Hmm. I saw him in Liverpool once; someone shouted ""C'mon Phil Collins"" and he never recovered. To think he let Kylie slip from his arms...
		 
			
			I don't want to talk about         I've met stamina at a house party once. Hes a cool dude. I could make it out for this one. I love hospital artists
		 
			
			Anyone going to see Santana tonight? My old man (who is a good laugh) is going by himself and he probaly wouldn't mind meeting up with some fellow old skool fans.       Anyone going to the Deftones show in Fribourg?  Has anyone been to that venu; is it large, small etc?  Thanks!
		    depending on which hall they use it can hold anywhere from 300 to about 3000 people. Considering it's the Deftones I'd imagine it would be the larger one. Frison is one of the best concert venues in Switz imo. One drawback to it though is that if you're in Basel or ZH it's often difficult to get back home with the train if you wanna stay till the end of the concert.
		    i'm going!    
i saw mastodon there last spring and i enjoyed it but have to say the acoustics there are pretty bad. there are certain spots where the reverberations from the big walls will turn the music into a horrible constant roar. a few feet to the left or right and it's ok again. also, there are no elevated viewing areas (all just a big floor) so if you are on the short side it might not be ideal. otherwise, i like the old warehouse style of venue.
		    Hmm, well i'd be comming from Basel so i guess i should start to look for someone with a car (if anyone is going anway?) or try and find a place to stay.  I wish there were better concert venues in Basel!  Thanks for the info!
		     
a friend of mine might be going with a car. Ask me when the time comes.
		    Cool, I'll prob catch the train over in the eve, let me know if you want to meet up.
		 
			
			Saw sharon jones and the dap kings last night @ kaufleuten and they were amazing. Invited two of my mates and they also raved about the show.   
First time ive been to kaufleuten too. Really cool venue. Might be a little posh for me though    
			
			Anyone going to see   on Friday?  Let me know, I'm going with another lady friend by train from Zurich hb.
		 
			
			The excellent Bonobo is playing a few dates in Switzerland

Or only CHF33 from Starticket
		    Ooh! Ooh!  I would totally join for Seu Jorge! But I'll be out of town.  
Ah well, next time. 
Let me know how the show is; never seen him live and most of the albums I love of his are *quite* a few years old.
		    Check out his  stuff!  
If you haven't already seen the LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU you must.
		    Balls. Im back home for Xmas. Bonobo is dooooooope
		 
			
			is there anyone interested in two free tickets to KARMA TO BURN playing in Martigny on Nov 3rd? i can't go now due to other plans. i hate to see good tickets go to waste...PM me if interested.
		     
Decent band and nice guys. I would take those tickets off you if only 1) I knew where Martigny was, and 2) David Max and the Sons of Void weren't playing in Basel and Spectrum weren't playing in Basel on the same night.
		 
			
			i was all set to drive an hour to martigny to see them, bought 2 tickets for me and a friend, then later discovered that i had mistaken the date and have another concert (public enemy) on the same night. then to top it off, they booked another show in yverdon on the next night, which is even closer than martigny. i'm planning to go to that one.        
Thank you so much for your post!   
I am definitely going to Seu Jorge's concert! 
Is anyone from Basel joining too?!
		 
			
			Moorcheeba with Skye (26th) in Zurich  
Sounds great, anyone going?
		 
			
			The Black Keys will be performing @ Rote Fabrik next March. 
Should be good!
		 
			
			Do we list club nights here or elsewhere?   
Anyway . . . looks like there's a good thing happening this weekend at Uto Kulm.  That's three legendary DJs!          Cheers for that, to confirm 24th March CHF35....Linky    
Sweet    
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned   as a gig guide/general stuff to do resource...just happened to see a copy of it on the tram this morning and it's a pretty comprehensive       Indeed.  I'm not sure if it's entirely comprehensive though.   
The @zueritipp Twitter feed is laughable.
		 
			
			ooooooH!!!! 
Coming back from the Cirque tonight I saw a poster for    for 25CHF next Thursday the 28th of October!

			Went there for the first time last night to see Caribou and Shy Child - what a fantastic dive it is ! I miss the toilet venues in London (Dublin Castle, Windmill, Notting Hill Arts Club and so on) and this place would not look out of place if it was in a side street off Oxford Street.   
Recommended if you like down and dirty venues and interesting up and coming bands.   
Shy Child totally kicked bottom. I enjoyed Caribou but after half an hour felt I had enjoyed them sufficiently.   
Coming up - Beach House, The Swans, A Place To Bury Strangers and in January The Fall   
Pay on the door, no advance booking, no credit cards. Like stepping back to the seventies but in a GOOD way.           
Ive been hearing her songs in the local Migros a lot actually. Maybe they have her album or that she's gaining a little notoriety in Switzerland?
		 
			
			of course, in response to this....  i have to offer up the original.  I was never a massive Chisel fan, before my time, but I know every word to this one.                     Only the two in Zurich...but at the Xavier Rudd on 21st and Panteon Rococo on 24th (also in abart)

			Hi all, there is a gig tonight with someone called Jess who is the lead singer - i met a guy from the band on the plane today - but he didnt know where it was! anyone any clue how I can find out where it is? I'vee googled everything I can think of and cant find anything with a Jess singing.

		    Strangely at the same address as Dollhouse  . Could make for some interesting shows.
		    So I look on their website and pop up a post. And then the next day I get a newsletter saying that it's not Zurich but Luzern.

			If any of youse are keen on your blues, C.W. Stoneking is playing @ El Lokal, Zurich on the 27th Feb.    
His version of seven nation army on TripleJ a few years ago was a think of beauty. Id post it but its block out of Australia    
			
			Ah, I can't believe I missed Lambchop. And Mark Lanegan, that hurts. And Einsturz. And New Model Army, they are still playing? Wowsies...I should really watch this thread.
		 
			
			Also I saw K&D are playing at Volkshaus on Jan 29th. Im super double mega pumped to see this if anyone's keen for a catch up
		    just got informed that johen arbeit will not be be playing after all      UPDATE VOM 07.01.2011: Leider musste Jochen  Arbeit die Tour aus familiären Gründen absagen. Brian Mitchell wird aber  im Café Kairo eine Solo-Show spielen.      Love love love C.W. Stoneking!   He will also be playing at ISC in Bern on 17th of Feb - this has just made my day.

			<3 the Cold War Kids! Thanks for the heads up on this show!      I've been living in Boston for two years now, and will be moving to Basel in a couple of months. The Dropkick Murphys put on a great show!
		 
			
			Thanks for the heads up...I saw them in Manchester many moons ago, and unfortunately they really did come off as a two/three song band. Still might be worth a watch in a small venue like the Abart.          When will you be in Basel?  If you want to meet up and have a chat or see a show drop me a line    Always nice to meet someone comming from Boston.
		    Sounds like a good show.  I will probably join.  Anyone else going?  Is this venu easy to get to from the main station?
		    Hi JustRose,       (from the Bahnhofquai/HB tramstop)  direction Albisgütli and get off at the Sihlcity Nord stop or you can catch the S4 Train (from track 1 at the Zürich HB) and get off at the Gieshubel stop. Both stops are walking distance.       Looks like the Black Keys have cancelled    
On the plus side Mogwai will play Rote Fabrik on Friday 11th March, tickets CHF35.    
			
			Some others I have seen on Zueritipp:

			Thin Lizzy are playing at Z7 in Pratteln on Thursday 3rd Feb.
		 
			
			I'm definitely going to catch the Foo Fighters at Greenfield this year. The teaser for new sound songs great (well at least the first 30 seconds). Sounds more like their older stuff.     
			
			my favourite song of the foo fighters is "" my hero"", followed by ""the pretender"" and ""wheels"". 
Looking forward to the festival........
		 
			
			I can't make it to Greenfield this year as ill be away so am planning to go to Southside festival (in southern germany) instead.  Anyone been to southside in past years?  It looks like a really great lineup this year: 
Foo Fighters * Blink-182 * Arcade Fire * The Chemical Brothers *Portishead * Arctic Monkeys * Clueso * The Hives * The Subways * Gogol Bordello * Flogging Molly * Elbow * The Wombats * Sublime With Rome * Two Door Cinema Club * Boysetsfire * Selig * Band Of Horses * The Sounds * Klaxons * Eels * Sick Of It All * Parkway Drive * William Fitzsimmons * I Am Kloot * Friendly Fires * Darwin Deez * Converge * Comeback Kid * Portugal. The Man * Kvelertak * You Me At Six * Brother * Cloud Control...
		 
			
			It's a worthy line up.  . The festival will be mid June.

			Ever since we moved to basel in October we have been on the hunt for local unsigned indie bands in cool small venues.  So far we have been to 2 gigs - both great but we are used to 2 or 3 a week!!!  Seems the venues are here but not always our genre of music (too heavy or hip-hop etc..)  so after waiting patiently - we have 2 gigs next weekend!! And all Swiss bands!!   
Friday the 25th at Kuppel for the Choo Choo's of Bern and the Kapoolas from Basel   
Saturday the 26th for Basel's own: Shelia She Loves You and the Oh' No's (two of the bands we've already seen) at the Union Kultur Club.   
Along with seeing the Charivari on Monday night (to see the Top Secret Drummers) its gonna be a good week!!!!
		 
			
			^ Sheila She Loves You are fab - their last gig at la Catrina in ZH last year was my fave gig of the whole year. I hope they make it back to ZH sometime soon!
		 
			
			Queens of the Stone Age   
At Komplex 457   
on 11th May
		     YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!                Gimme....where?
		 
			
			In basel try out 
Nordstern 
Hirshnek 
NT areal
		    Cheers for the heads up. Just bagged me some tickets      The one venue we really liked was Sommer Casino - they do a lot of rock, metal as well as hip/hop.  Only a couple indie nights over the last few months.  Also look at the Kaserne - this is right near us and looks fab from the outside but nothing on their calendar really appeals to us.
		    I have to yet find heavy and actually interesting here, but it is not like I venture out much for this, we live in a tiny place...so gota give it real chance. The stuff I have heard was either to eager to be heavy, leaving everything else behind, or noise for the sake of noise, but I am sure there is something worth listening.
		 
			
			queens of the stone age will also be at this year's kilby at bad bonn!!!! can't wait to find out the rest of the lineup!           Just some info on tix: tickets go on sale this  , limited to 4 per person, from either        
or        
Tix are expected to sell out fast, so get in quick!
		 
			
			After lots of wondering why there had been no news, I was sad to hear today that there will be no Zurich Open Air Festival this year   - last year's line-up was so awesome.   
BUT   
it is confirmed for 2012. Yay!       
			
			Bad Kilbi Bonn's a great festival, great atmosphere and generally good bands there. I saw the legendary Sunn o))) there a couple of years ago.
		     :d
		    And they are now sold out.
		 
			
			The Sadies @ El Lokal May 29 ... Also playing the Stolze Open Air Festival Zurich on May 28th     
cheers, 
Sue
		    ahem      
Anyway. She was fantastic.   
It was my first time at Komplex. And it's tiny. I was expecting somewhere a bit bigger than abart but I think it's actually smaller. Although it does have a higher ceiling which helps with the sound.
		    Smaller than Abart?!  Mmkay, explains why QOTSA sold out so quickly.
		    I'm sad that I missed her      
The Komplex venue can be rearranged for bigger shows. The walls are all moveable - actually it's a huge space. That's why it can accommodate bigger acts like QOTSA, My Chemical Romance, Interpol etc etc as well as the smaller ones (Phoenix Foundation, Caitlin Rose) I think the capacity is up to 5000.
		 
			
			Looks like British Sea Power have cancelled their March European tour,  including the Abart gig on the 09.03.11.    
Not sure why....but Noble cracked a rib at the last gig. Bummer!   
Gigs will hopefuly be re-scheduled for later in 2011.
		    Yep, it is planned to be re-scheduled ... or at least that is the plan so far. Fingers crossed!       I used to love Belle and Sebastian until I saw them at Open Air last year, they were pretty lame.    
			
			Haha, got sucked in and forgot what I came on here originally to post    
Anyone else going to Roger Waters this summer? I am already looking forward to it!! I just can't wait haha    
			
			I am going! can't wait       I bought The Boy With The Arab Strap when it first came out on vinyl but never really got into it. Then late last year I bought the latest and love it. Since then I have bought all of the CD's so I hope I'm not disappointed but I think they will be better indoors than out. And it should have a totally different vibe to a festival.

José is a world renowned guitarist, born in Brazil but living in Nyon. He used to teach at the Geneva conservatoire, and has appeared many times at The Paleo and Montreux Jazz festivals. A brilliant artist.
		    When you think they started as a college project, they've come far from the days of playing King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow.   
I've seen them a few times and they always deliver, but can get a little twee. At one show at the Rote Fabrik they covered Dire Straits' Romeo and Juliet. Hmm. Since Isobel Campbell left, so did the darker elements. Still worth seeing though    
			
			Atari Teenage Riot are playing @ Salzhaus, Winterthur 21.05.2011:

(Other annoucements for Gurten: The Ting Tings, Kate Nash & Royal Republic)
		 
			
			Noise fans,  is playing tomorrow (sun March 6th, 9pm), in Geneva, at  .    
I was curious myself, saw this performer from New Zeland 3 days ago in Prague and he blew my mind. Plus, he is a really cool dude, high school prof on his sabatical touring the world with his musical mission. He is quite big in his field, so far on this tour he has played in UK, Scandinavia, CZ, FR, after CH he is going to Japan. Just a note for the gentle souls amongst us, bring ear plugs (just in case the sound guy sucks  ).    
It's short and sweet, very intense and a ton of dizzy fun. We are going.
		     
Wow...just checked out the Gurtenfestival...many bands I like!

			Yes please.           that sounds really good, shame I missed it.
		 
			
			Lloyd Cole small ensemble 13th April at Restaurant Viadukt.
		    Actually, it was awesome....The Geneva performance better than in Prague, then, Cave 12 threw a gig yesterday -  and  also quite obscure noise, I am sorry I have missed those 2.    
But, were very lucky to have Campbell Kneale of  on our couch past few days, weeheee...a lot of interesting talk.    
Check out Cave12 in Geneva, it's a fantastic project, loads of gigs are in  , an experimental culture place, I think it used to be a squat, unsurprisingly. I love the venue, nice people, guests and staff. Cave12 are great, too. Very approachable, I want to gig with them, when we finally put sh...t together.

2 Day music festival in Basel - April 1st and 2nd. Figures we are in scotland that weekend for a 2 day music festival in Edinburgh but anyone else looking for live music (indie, etc...) in little venues should consider going!!   
I've been to a couple of the venues and they were great (summer casino, kaserne) and have seen The Kapoolas and really liked them.   
Oh and Shelia she loves you!!  Very good local Basel band!
		 
			
			I've got the following gigs lined up: the human league, swans and qotsa at the bad kilbi bonn festival, earth, cyndi lauper, marianne faithful, belle and sebastian but I'm most looking forward to seeing Earth

			lyle Lovett plays at kaufleuten jul 17th, good charlotte plays at komplex 457 
aug 04th
		 
			
			Flexing my urban muscle, Frauenfeld 2011:   
Snoop Dogg, Lil Wayne, Cypress Hill, Wyclef Jean, The Roots, Taio Cruz, Ice Cube, Black Star (Mos Def and Talib Kweli), M.O.P, Public Enemy....to name a few.   
Sounds like a hot ticket
		 
			
			for the same customers(frauenfeld) is the festival in wohlen (Touch the air), june 23th to 26th with timabland, akon, ludacris, busta rhymes to name a few     
			
			British band The Brew playing the Galery Music Bar near Z7 in Pratteln tomorrow night        Yes that looks a great line-up. Underworld are amazing live, and been wanting to see 2ManyDJs live for a long time. 
I'll hopefully be able to spend the whole weekend there.     
And for this weekend (Sat 2nd April): Kings Of The Jungle @ Komplex Zürich:        
			
			Another reminder for my mates awesome Rock'nRoll April events at Sedel, Luzern, stoner/pysch/desert/doom rock.   Different concerts on the 3rd, 8th, 21st(22nd is a holiday btw, so you can stay out late) and the 23rd of April, see   for details.       
Sedel is a great venue for these bands, I just wish it was a little closer to town.  Shuttle busses do run every half hour I think and only cost a tip for the driver.
		 
			
			Also, just seen   and   are playing Stall 6 in Zurich on the 2nd of April.  Loving whatever that scene is, electronic hip hop beats, monster bass and synths.  Their albums are well worth a listen if you don't mind a bit of the electronic).   
Edit : FFS, Young Gods play Sedel on the same night, and it's a friends birthday, damn.
		 
			
			The line-up for the Palèo Festival has just been announced - The National, PJ Harvey, Portishead, Beirut, The Strokes, Anna Calvi, The Chemical Brothers and more...               
			
			Filter at Abart on 22 June       there are some fine acts playing there but mainly during the week and I've got to work!    
			
			Best thing about Paleo, for me, has always been the discovery of acts I would've never seen otherwise...  &   come to mind in recent memory
		 
			
			Don't forget! Belle and Sebastian @ X-Tra ZH next Wednesday 13.04.11 Perfect indie pop - herbaceous borders, foxes, cups of tea etc etc            
Filter are phenomenal live, I saw them at a festival when Richard Patrick got nailed in the head with waterbottle. Didn't miss a beat right at the corus of 'Hey Man Nice Shot'.   
Crowd went berzerk! Sick mosh pit. I never knew 'Take a Picture' could be such a heavy song.   
Gonna hit up this show up for sure.
		 
			
			José González & The Göteborg String Theory are playing tomorrow (Friday 8th April) at Salzhaus Winterthur.       
Anyone else going as well?
		   Ben Howard is playing at the Caribana Festival in Crans-près-Céligny on 11th June:           Has anyone been to this small Festival?

Its like the musical form of Inception

			anyone else going to einstürzende neubauten tomorrow and on thursday in lausanne? i'm SO looking forward to it! if i manage to get there in time that is...   
			
			A while away yet, but awesome Kiwi band   are playing at Abart, ZH, Thurs. 08 September 2011. I saw them at the m4m festival this year and they almost blew the roof off Exil.
		 
			
			Cut Copy + Architecture in Helsinki @ Stall 6, ZH, 28.06.11 - so I will get to see AiH this year after all    
			
			Grandmaster Flash at Stall 6, Zürich, Saturday May 28, 22.00
		    Getting back home was the expected long, drawn-out, sleepy saga, but it was worth it. Cinema-gig with the band sitting on stage in front of the screen, ripping into their instruments, while videos played behind, it was pretty unique. The band hung around before and after and had beers with the masses too, nice blokes.
		 
			
			DJ Shadow at Komplex Zurich on 04.06   
and Arcade Fire at Montreux Jazz Festival on 10th July!!          I try and go every year, will be there all 4 days this time. If you like old school 90s hip hop they usually have a big name one evening or another. The rest is either French Pop / Reggae (so many hippies in NE) / usually decent electro and some kids singer on the Sunday afternoon which is when the families are there.    
  It was really crowded last year, I hope it'll be better organised (more bars, less VIP space) so getting drinks doesn't take half an hour. There's load of benches and what not so sit down on and it's by the lakeside so you can smoke by the rocks if you want. Thing of it as a Fete Des Vendanges you have to pay an entrance to and that has decent music. Well worth it... so long as it doesn't rain too much, but most of the place is covered by tents anyway.
		 
			
			Too bad I am not here!  
The  in Winterthur (15 min by train from Zürich!) is on in June, they have concerts from June 10-12th.               
ENJOY         playing Zürich 30th June
		 
			
			Anyone wanna join me in the Rote Fabrik to see Slim Cessna's Auto Club. Some band members from 16 Horsepower, in the theme of American folkrock, kinda.       
			
			Simian Mobile Disco playing Nordstern in Basel on Friday night and Cut Copy playing Hinterhof on 29th. Really looking forward to both.

TOXIC HOLOCAUST 
TRAP THEM 
WOLVES LIKE US
		 
			
			Destroyer is playing Rote Fabrik on the 24th of June. His last album out-80s the 80s, and if the live show is anywhere near as batshit-bizarre as this video, it should be interesting.

		    Yes - did I miss it?     
Can't believe I've only just found this thread    
			
			Just got back from seeing Filter at Abart. It was AWESOME! It's quite surreal seeing bands that I grew up listening to.  Back in the Republic of South Africa, it's a dream come true to see bands like this.  I'm very grateful to be able to have these experiences and see these band that I admire and really love.
		 
			
			Sebadoh at Abart in Zürich on August the 15th. Grungey!       
			
			Just happened to notice Fleet Foxes are playing at Komplex 457 on 21.11...some way off yet I know! As much as I like their albums I'm not sure about seeing them live - anyone seen them before?
		 
			
			^ I haven't seen Fleet Foxes before, but I'll be there.   
also, awesome aussies cloud control are playing at hafenkneipe 19.09.11. great band, lovely people.
		    Not quite my thing but very good live, I've heard.
		 
			
			Switzerland has its fair share of good gigs!!!      always has a good line up.   
And the Red Hot Chili Peppers are playing in Zurich before they even come to the UK!!!! Dec 13th at Hallenstadion!
		 
			
			The Dub Pistols are playing in Fribourg tomorrow night, 2nd July, as part of Fribourg Jazz Parade. Don't really know much about them, but sound right up my street.          Generally regarded as having given a very weak performance at Glasto last weekend.
		 
			
			Manic Street Preachers are playing at the Winterthurer Musikfestwochen on Sunday 28.08.11:          @ Plaza, ZH, 01.11.11. Tickets  .
		 
			
			11.10.2011 - Beady Eye @ Volkshaus, Zurich 
Tickets are going on sale tomorrow ( )
		 
			
			Not Zürich but definately worth the trip - The Antlers play St. Gallen 3rd December.
		 
			
			Some bands work much better in a venue then at a festival. Actually most bands do.       
			
			Hi we're just moving down from Lux in Sept and in the past few weeks have seen Foals, PJ Harvey - Prince played here etc etc. There is a good music scene here and it's advertised of 2 main websites, is that the case in Zurich or Switz as a rule? 
Thanks
		    Arse - back in the UK then. The last album was a corker .... back to the old form
		    Sunday August 14 - Zofingen - Heitere Open Air Festival
		    It's ok. There's a lot of bands that don't come. As Far as I'm aware PJ and Foals have never been.
		    PJ plays Paleo I believe, this weekend. And I'll miss her       Tickets available on ricardo if you want them.    
I'm just going to pretend that I meant Zürich.
		    Nope ... Foals played at Abart last year. Zurich is not that bad after all       I didn't say i was bad, just ok! I'll revise my opinion when Radiohead come and play on their next tour.
		    damn, only one Swiss date??    
Will you be seeing them on the UK leg of their tour DP?
		    I am going to see them in Hastings.  Just a few minutes walk from my house

PRINCE!!       
There are no more standing tickets left from ^ that ticket link, but I found mine from a UK website
		 
			
			The concert from prince in cologne arena was absolut rubbish, he played 
one song, left the stage for 50 mins, returned for anonther 65 mins and left 
early after a total of 75 mins played, some people payed about 150 euros for a seat.         That's a shame. He's usually one of the best live acts out there (imo) 
I hope he'll not be doing the same in Zurich
		 
			
			Friendly Fires will definitely be worth a look....   
Sadly I won't be able to make it - but I recommend   (Abart, 8th Sept)

Saw them a couple of years ago at that very spot.  Was very, very loud, we got very drunk, one mate got into a fight in the mosh pit and was almost thrown out, another ended up sleeping under a mattress in a squat somewhere in Zurich.
		 
			
			I'd like to recommend the songkick.com website, it's brilliant. 
It scans your iTunes library or you can quickly and easily choose the interests that interest you as well as the cities and you have a personalized calendar and receive emails when concerts of interest are announced.

This is spam but the songkick iOS app is pretty good.

			Not so much a Heads-up, more of an ""Oh Bollocks"", but did anyone catch the Buzzcocks in Aarau last Saturday? Any good? I missed it as I was in the UK.        Saw them last year when the played Zug OpenAir (free festival) it was nice to say I'd seen them but tbh they were nothing special at all.

			For all you Vaud jazzers,   is coming to Chorus, Lausanne, 15 October 201, with his Migration band.  This is a musician/drummer not to be missed if you can make the gig.  Reservations will be necessary, I am sure.   
Antonio has many projects, but those of you in the know will recognize him as Pat Metheny's drummer in his PMG (Pat Metheny Group), the drummer since 2003.       
This is a big musician coming to Lausanne.

		    Too bad Trap Them was cancelled for this show   They now got replaced by The Secret
		 
			
			Blue October are coming to Z-7 in Pratteln BL on 19 November.  I saw them once in Boston and it was a good show.  Too bad i am not in Basel then to see them again.

			Brit Bobby Long is playing on October 16 at Laborbar in Zurich at 20:00.  It will be a great show by a super talented artist!  If anyone's interested in going, let me know!   is his website if you want to check out his music....
		 
			
			Perhaps this could be interesting for some people: the people from the Kilbi festival in Düdingen/Bad Bonn will launch something like a   in winter - 9th/10th December in Exil (and Moods) Zurich.   
Particularly looking forward to Glenn Branca Ensemble and Thurston Moore. It's a little pricey (85.- for both days), though it's worth it for me.
		    presents  .   
The concert will be held on  at  , at   in Burgweg 7, 4058 Basel.   
You can buy tickets for 24 CHF through  ,  , at SBB and Post. Or you can buy it at the venue for 26 CHF from 21h on the night of the gig.   
The concert itself starts at 22h, but there will be a party at around midnight with DJ Edin and DJ Bob Rock playing Balkan/electro music.   
Kultur Shock plays some sort of Balkan music/rock/metal/punk fusion, and they are particularly good live. Well see for yourselves:       
and the same track live at exitfest 2010 in Novi Sad, Serbia:       
Great huh?! }:-) 
See you there!
		 
			
			Don't forget: British Sea Power are playing at the Abart, ZH this Wednesday 12.10.11. They had to cancel their ZH show twice before, so fingers crossed they'll make it this time!           
			
			pretty much my reaction too, with an few choice expletives thrown in though. I did regain my composure long enough to selflessly post it here, thinking it might help some deserving music fan out that way catch them.          Good concert, though I was pretty drunk. Place seemed to empty by the end of the gig, shame really, but as their last album was their worst so far then I'm not surprised.
		 
			
			Just got my Tickets for   at Stall 6, 6th November.   
For techno heads, Richie Hawtin is playing as  , Komplex 457, 22nd October.

			Saharan blues from Tinariwen at Kaufleuten in Zurich on Saturday 15th October. If you've not heard them live and like riddim then it's the concert for you. A major influence on so many records recently.   
I happen to have two tickets for this show for sale at cost price  .       
			
			Has it sold out? I was considering it but won't decide until Saturday. I'll post again on sat just in case you haven't sold them.
		 
			
			Glasgow-based band   are playing at Papiersaal, ZH, on Wednesday 19.10.11. I'm liking them a lot lately, and I reckon they'll be great:         (I've also got some free tix if anyone wants them: http://wp.me/pLHpb-1i4)   
			
			The Italian electro-rock band   is visiting Basel.   
The gig is starting at 21h on 30th of October in Grenzwert bar (Rheingasse 3, in Kleinbasel).      to their profile with more of their work.   
And a small glimpse on what you might expecting a few weeks:     
So if you feel like changing your Swiss routine, you can start by going out on Sunday evenings as well. }:-)   
See you there!
		 
			
			Not my kind of music - normally, but they have some catchy pop songs which put you in a good mood. Swiss - German music   - in English.

Dropkick Murphys , Feb 04 th Komplex 457 , Zurich
		    We rarely read reviews after the event on this thread, so I'll keep it brief: It was very good   Support act François & The Atlas Mountains had some interesting beats but strange, Eno-esque dance moves, which were a bit theatrical, but in all very West Coast French dance melancholia. Anna Calvi's voice is a joy to hear. Nuff said.   
Oh Hai GastroGnome! I tried to grab ya but you had more beauties surrounding you than I did, so I didn't want to steal your thunder       I was there too! I'll be writing a review soon (on my blog, though, will post a link), just haven't had a moment. We should do a meet up at the next suitable gig, what do you think?

might be worth a drive from lausanne but the tuesday night thing is a killer.
		 
			
			A bumper week for music in ZH next week! Obviously getting to all of them may involve some kind of cloning technology   but here are my tips:       
			
			I'd love to say The Kills were great last night, but due to the   sound at X-tra, it's hard to say.    
Not the first time either - I'm not going to waste my hard earned on that venue anymore.
		     Were you upstairs or downstairs?   
I find if you are right in the middle upstairs the sound is not so bad.

			Sisters of mercy (chf 55) and its at xtra in zurich. Date 23rd November 2011   
I've got a spare ticket for the above   
If you're interested please pm me
		 
			
			looking forward for the sisters of mercy tomorrow and on thursday! can't believe i have never seen them before!    
next days' schedule:     
tomorrow: work, drive to zürich, gig, drive back 
thursday: train to lausanne, work, gig, sleep 
friday: drive back, work 
saturday: drive to zürich, vive la fete gig 
sunday: drive back, probably spend day on sofa 
monday: work, drive to zürich, fakir's gig, drive back ?   
why do all the bands chose to play at the same time and almost never in bern??
		    I was bang in the middle, about a foot behind the sound desk. Logically I would have thought the best place for sound in the venue...       yes,that is normally the best spot  . Try upstairs next time if you can.
		    price negotiable, if anyone is interested
		    mhm, the last time when there was paul kalkbrenner, sound was fine?!  
same with belle & sebastian and morcheeba.
		 
			
			sisters of mercy gig at the xtra was pretty good but the sound quality was terrible, more due to xtra than the sisters. not the first time a gig has been ruined for me at the xtra due to useless sound quality
		 
			
			Right, don0t know what the problem there is. The second half of the gig was much better.          Skindred are an awesome band - saw them at Download a couple of years back.  DK Murphies are a must see too - saw them in boston last year.
		 
			
			anyone going to any of these?   
the horrors - tomorrow night 
smashing pumpkins - next fri 2nd dec 
dEUS - next sat 3rd dec 
thurston moore - sat after 10th dec   
im new to town (zurich) but will be headinbg to these gigs, so feel free to say hi!   
(especially if you know where i can buy vimto...)
		 
			
			I'll be at the Horrors tonight, gimme a shout if you want to meet up. I know of a few Asian stores in Oerlikon which sell Vimeo that I can give you directions for ^^
		 
			
			sounds good       i'll most probably be at the dEUS one! and also at dEUS in neuchatel on the 6th     
thurston moore, i thought i was going but it's on the same date as FAQ's gig in Aarau   
and i think i'm probably going there, as the partying will surely be better!    
i had some friends seeing smashing pumpkins in london a few weeks ago and they were very disappointed (and they are pretty big fans). so i'm not going (to be fair, i wouldn't go anyway as i'm not crazy about them)   
we seem to like similar music, so feel free to come and say hi tomorrow at Fakir's show in kaffi für dich (details a few posts above).
		 
			
			Hi Crimson, I'll see I will see about monday night, tho i tend to work late at the moment. I'll def be at dEUS tho, my fav band! That should be ace. it woul dbe good to go to the show on the 6th as well but, work!   
Shame to hear your friends didnt like the pumpkins recently, i had friends at copenhagen, manchester and london gigs and they were nothing but loving the shows. they are the band that usually suprise me most at shows with how amazing they are, but i shall see!
		 
			
			i hope you will enjoy the sp show! let us know!

The Musical Box is a highly professional canadian Genesis tribute band. They bring the early Genesis years - when Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett were still in the band - back to life. They recreate their vintage shows as original as possible. The sounds, the sights, the costumes, the lights, the everything. They are very approved by the original band. Phil Collins even played a show or two with them. This time they will play the ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"" show in its entirety. It's rumoured that original Genesis guitarist   will join them for the encores!

That's the original price. I will not charge any postal delivery costs but require payment in advance, preferably paypal. I would send them out immediately after having received the money.

while I had my head in the books studying for exams I forgot to do something very important (buy Noel Gallagher tickets at Komplex 457). Now they have sold out and I am kicking myself(!). If anyone has 2 spare tickets that they would like to sell or knows of a way that I can legally acquire said tickets, I would be most appreciative

			woo.     play Zurich's Volkshaus 7th March. From CHF55.-     play 13th March in Zurich's Kaufleuten. From CHF50.-      play 16th March in Zurich's Kaufleuten. From CHF50.-     
hoo.   
CHF300.- gone. just. like. that.                  I've got tickets for wilco, earth, bruce springsteen and mastodon. I am thinking of seeing the tindersticks (brilliant in geneva in 2010, good in zurich in 2011) and lambchop. I saw lambchop a few years ago in the rote fabrik and they were dreadful, the band was sloppy, the crowd got bored and people started to go home. they must have had a fight because there was lots of banter between them which didn't involve the audience. this was promoting the damaged album.
		    I was at that gig: it was US Independence Day. Talking backstage with them during the interval Kurt and MacManus were talking about being TourBlind: it was getting tired and no longer personal. They wanted to be with their families, especially on that night. After a peace pipe, they came back on and played some haunting stuff, which many didn't enjoy, as you note. The banter was down to, er, the pipe, me thinks.   
Crap jokes were still crap, though. Can't wait to see them again.
		 
			
			for any Radiohead fans out there..    
I just got an alert on Facebook saying Radiohead tickets go on sale tomorrow  (31january) for a performance at Montreux 09 July
		 
			
			I got mine   who else will be there?          thanks that explains it, I have been thinking about that gig for years wondering why such a fine band had such a night
		    Gah! Thanksgiving. It was November. Don't know my foreign national holidays.

Glass Swords is one of the best albums of last year, though TBH, the appeal may not be immediately obvious.
		    Thanks for this old advice Jimmy Bee! I did not make the concert last year but went tonight to see him at Moods, he was playing with his Primitive Horn Orchestra...       Yes, brilliant music. But their concerts should be black and white.
		    Haha! So true....      - are you sure you are ""working"" out of the country for three months? Pretty sure me and Prof T saw you playing the drums last night in the Primitive Orchestra!

			Hi everyone, I'm new to this forum, so please bear with me, at least for a while. I was thinking to create a group on Meetup for people that go to concerts in Zurich, and perhaps want to go with someone else or bigger crowd.Would anyone be interested to join?    
I'm thinking (next few months) :   
26.03 Damien Jurado (el Local) 
31.03 Olafur Arnalds (moods) 
02.04 Veronica Falls (Mascotte) 
28.04 Bowerbirds (el Local) 
29.04 Laura Gibson (el Local) 
06.06 Tortoise (moods)   
If sth like that already exist let me know of course, i might have missed it.

Headliners on August 24th:     Franz Ferdinand   
Headliners on August 26th:     Flogging Molly     
			
			The   lineup is pretty damn good, especially the Saturday: Afghan Whigs, Mudhoney, and Lee Ranaldo.      Canadians Unit!      is playing at Parterre in Basel on April 7th!   
For anyone who hasn't heard this Canadian gem, they are highly acclaimed and having seen them in concert back in Manitoba, they are amazing live.           Hello and welcome to the Forum. You can post concert events on the mysteriously invisible*   or under   ( if you're a promoter or financially involved).   
Putting a concert / event on the calendar gives it greater exposure and allows for some 'buzz' (is this what the kids call it these days?).   
Also, you can set up a  . This particular thread can be hard work to get overview, so lead from the front!   
*Must look into why it doesn't show under the Events icon    
			
			this is a 'wee bit early but if there are any Diana Krall fans out there she will be playing Lucerne in November ( she just sent me an email to let me know )

			AND.............   
any Pink Martini fans... ??    
they  (+/- China Forbes ? ) will be performing at the Verbier Festival 01August

Reggae...   
			
			The Concerts calendar is now added to the Events menu - thanks Editor Bob.    
As it's tricky getting overview of posts made in this thread perhaps consider adding a concert to the concerts calendar if you intend going as this may encourage others and it'll build our social opportunities.    
Lambchop play Kaufleuten in Zurich tonight. As I'm not attending - sad - I won't post it on the calendar, but were I to be going...   
Keep on rockin' in the free world.

where do i get the permission ?

			MAZZY STAR is playing in the Rote Fabrik in Zürich on the 18th of July         MOD EDIT: Nickelback thread merged   
I have never met an actual fan of this band.   
I'm sure they have some, but are probably too embarrassed to admit it. I don't blame them.
		   They've sold over 50 million albums, allegedly
		 
			
			I've been wanting to see Mazzy Star for years but alas I'm on holiday that day!
		 
			
			the song about the panties down by the ankles is cringeworthy
		    The same fans that think Bon Jovi are a great ""heavy metal band"" or ""Survivor"" and ""Europe"" kick ass.*           (*Um, they don't ....)   
			
			here's a great video with all the wikipedia 'updates' on Nickelback over the years.     
Some are very informative and amusing            
I guess I'll be dancing alone then           Canada has enough awesome music.    
Nickelback is just the Canadian reaction to Creed.

( I'm not overwhelmed personally )
		 
			
			Looking forward to RPWL at the Galery Music Bar in Pratteln this evening:       
Although the Z-7 crew are promoting and selling tickets, the venue is the Galery just down the road, not the Z-7 black hall.   
RPWL started life as a Pink Floyd covers band, but they've had their own progressive style for more than a decade now, their latest CD ""Beyond Man and Time"" is very good melodic rock.
		    I'd go just to see Janelle Monae. She's amazing
		    I like the line-up but can't understand why it's called Montreux ""Jazz"". Been to Cully last weekend, much jazzier there and a fantastic atmosphere.
		 
			
			Would love to see Tony Bennett but tickets are very expensive
		    I guess it's kind of hard to change the name midride.... and much of nowadays music is influenced by jazz (the good stuff at least)
		 
			
			Eagles of Death Metal are playing in Solothurn on the 21st of June.           
Nothing remarkably new or mindblowingly good, but never fail to entertain live. I'd go just to see Jesse Hughes do his little dance.

Saw him a few years ago at the wonderful bastion of downtown bohemia El Lokal, but almost fell asleep. He has a massive following but somehow he's lost his bite.    
Chicks dig him though, so see you there.
		    Definitely a victim of his own prolificacy.   
He is my beard mentor though, I'll be heading along for some ad hoc trimming tips.

		          The Tindersticks are a brilliant band, check out their second album with this cover (   and Curtains:   
The music is melancholic, moody, orchestral   
They can be brilliant live especially when they have their string and horn sections in tow.   
I fully recommmend them and good luck!
		    Thanks for the heads-up on this @Crumbs.  Can't wait!    
			
			What is it with the XTRA venue in Zürich?The sound quality is truly dreadful. I have seen several live bands there and I have always noticed the poor sound quality. Only the supremely organized or very loud acts seem to be able to overcome the poor sound quality of this venue.
		 
			
			Thanks PaddyG, I've been wanting to see the Maccabees for years :-). Seen Tindersticks, not really my bag.       
			
			I'll be going to:

		    There have been rumours about (no pun intended  ) that Christine McVie may also appear on the tour
		    I'm glad to hear it but I thought she'd retired completely, she really has to sing her songs, Stevie Nicks has too country a voice to sing Christine's songs imho. I'm also really looking forward to seeing Buckingham, a seriously underrated guitarist, play

They are appearing at Z7 in Pratteln on May 9th.     
This as a trailer to their debut album 'Dimensionaut'.  It should appeal to all prog. rock fans.          Thanks for the heads up. Saw them last night at the Stadthalle in Sursee. It was just like it would be to see the real Pink Floyd playing in a high school basketball gym. Fantastic!

I'm finally going to get to see one of my favourite bands!    
			
			Nouvelle Vague play Kaserne in Basel on 2nd October. I have my tickets :-)           
btw what did you think of the gig? I wasn't impressed, I saw her last year in Geneva and she way way better
		    strange, i was also last year in geneva and did not enjoy it very much. i thought she was in a bad mood, whereas in zürich she was in a good mood   
i really liked the one in zürich and the one in montreux a couple of weeks later. still have the songs in my head. gotta love her.
		    i'm going as well! and to another place they're playing, could it be geneva? (yes too lazy to check)    
i've seen them live a few times already and i'm always impressed by the energy they bring on stage. much better than the cds in my opinion. you will love it!
		    Oh! I thought I might be the only one from here that would be interested. Maybe with the exception of Prof T.   
I saw Red Sky Coven a few years ago, but haven't managed NMA yet. Really looking forward to it.
		    exciting, isn't it?   see you there!    
			
			Fat Freddy's Drop, in Zurich 21st October

		    god they were incredibily shit live 3 years ago at the kaufleuten. they sound like a local schoolband doing covers, far from their fab CD productions.

			For country fans, Band Perry will be in concert in Zurich at   on the 23rd of November.  Warm-up acts (not listed here) are:  Easton Corbin and a a dynamite guitar player from Canada, Lindsay Ell (her mentor was Randy Bachman of BTO).
		 
			
			I don't get the nouvelle vague love, for me its money for old rope.
		    well, some versions have a bit of fresh new paint to it or sound interesting though i am not a big fan. just got a ticket from a friend, so i just 'been there'. what i like about them is the nice singing voice of the girl that wasnt there at kaufleuten and therefor (sorry, lou) were rather like a fly buzzing around my head...
		 
			
			vive la fete are playing in bern this coming saturday. woop!        
			
			Hi guys, been lucky enough to follow some of the greatest bands around just before they ""made it"" (luck and friends, not me). Went to see this Swiss band absolutely amazing and a brilliant punctuation to my move to Sydney. I think Domi should be big and I mean BIG       This got good around the five minute mark.  Sounds like what would happen if you put Thom Yorke and the XX in the same room.
		    Really cool music but my god what a shocking voice. They really need a new singer...        You have a good point...Not everyone can be this guy:       
			
			Anyone going to see Lucero on September 18?
		    I gotta see her live one of these days, can't believe I have missed her so many times. Did she do Nude on the News?
		    nope, unfortunately! according to my catpower expert boyfriend (and kind of friend of hers) she refuses to play it
		    I can't have too much of her all the time, a bit too dramatic but Nude on the News is one of my all time favs, really. She is so spontaneous and talented. I hung with folks who went to see her a lot in Atlanta.
		    i cannot have too much of her at once as well. but i like her more and more as the years go by
		 
			
			So I went to see Nouvelle Vague on Wednesday night, the sound quality of the band was not so good but the singing was perfectly fine and the entertainment factor was excellent. Over all a great night out and a lot of fun; I would go and see them again.           maybe because her song is called Nude as the News... see! Catpower loves me more than you!    
			
			After skipping out on most of the festival scene this summer, I'm excited to see The Dirty Head and the iconic Sublime (with Rome) on Nov. 12 at Haerterei. Great show for those who enjoy the punk/ska/reggae cali scene.           
			
			Rude Zone Festival at Dynamo, Zurich, November 1st:     
with BAD MANNERS and RED SOUL COMMUNITY, ++support           
			
			Sea Sick Steve @ Komplex on the 2nd Nov. is gonna be great.    
			
			Has a spare ticket for Sea Sick on Saturday, worth 38.- will sell for 30.- send me a PM.
		 
			
			I'm going to the following shows in Zurich; if anyone wants to join on the end then you're more than welcome to get the first beers in.     play the Viadukt Bogen F; Thursday 7th November, 21:00, CHF35.-          (Sold Out but worth a visit for the Abend Kasse option) @ Rote Fabrik Friday 8th November, supported by Zurich group  ; well worth an early arrival. CHF28.-          plays Exil, Thurs. 14th Nov, CHF25.-         play the Rote Fabrik, 20:30, Thurs 21st Nov. CHF30.-        play the Rote Fabrik, Weds 20th Nov. 20:30 CHF25.- - an absolute snip!          plays the Rote Fabrik, Thurs. 5th. Dec 20:30 CHF25.-

		    Bad bonn kilbi is the best featival ever! In the middle of nowhere....highly recommended! I cannot go this year (getting married that weekend) but i cannot stress enough what a cool festival it is! 
Ps: if you go make sure to walk to the nearby lake and enjoy the beauty of thr scenery
		     
oh wow The Black Angels too! AND Mac Demarco!
		 
			
			Just seen the line up for Monteux Jazz 2015 and I don't think there is any artist that particularly stands out.  Perhaps they are keeping the best for next year as it will be the 50th one       
			
			thanks for the heads up, some good acts playing like Ibeyi, Foxygen, The Staves, Portishead, Sophie Hunger, Lionel Richie, Kronos Quartet, James Blake, Sly and Robbie, Anna Calvi, Alt J, Santana, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, George Benson,  etc etc   
but some serious crap as well, there is very little quality control going on these days
		 
			
			i'd also recommend dEUS and asaf avidan
		    I missed this, I love the Sleaford Mods!   
Otherwise a weak line up. I saw Thurston Moore with Sonic Youth at BKB a few years ago and they were lame. Highlight were the mighty Sunn O)))   
@crimson, I fully agree BKB is a great festival with a great vibe
		 
			
			Thurston Moore solo, I would go see. It is different, especially if he is in the mood.    
dEus is amazing. And James Blake.    
I want to see all that       Thurston Moore has different moods? How can one tell?
		    The left corner of his lips is about 2mm above the right one?   
I know    
But I do like drony stuff that washes over. There's certain poetry in a wall of noise.    
Which reminds me, completely unrelated, I gotta wish for a uke for my bday that is coming up    
			
			Ed Sheeran - is he back anytime soon?

Nada Surf 22.04.2016 Dynamo 
We plan to be around ..just wondering
		    No idea but its May now, so you're most likely a little late.   
			
			recommended gigs in the VERY NEAR future (May) for Zurich:   
16.05: Dandy Warhols, Plaza (think of White Stripes with more fun)     
27.05: Porches, Klaus (from NYC - great fun)     
28.05: Dead Meadow, Club Zukunft (superb psych/garage band)     
29.05: Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Mascotte (surely no need to introduce them?)        anyway, they are a good band - very indie, if they come round again worth the trip.
		 
			
			Ezra Furman plays in Zurich tonight at Bogen F, 21:00.
		   play in Zurich at the  , 8th February.        
			
			I love them. ""Up with People"".   
Ezra Furman and his ""My Zero"" is MiniMC's ultimately fav song.
		    Doh! its the Missus's Birthday, oh well, I will just say its a surprise       Lambchop play Geneva the night before the Zurich gig; they play Luzern the night after.    
Ezra was ok the other night but the crowd seemed more happy to be there than enjoy being there, but that's the Swiss concert experience. He seemed tired.
		    I find that infuriating, in Zürich its about being seen at a concert but with absolutely no interest in the music! I am always telling people to stfu especially during quieter songs, when it seems the gig becomes a social gathering. The amount of times I have heard performers saying something about that during a performance, I don't think the Zürich audience gets it!    
			
			sooooo true....
		 
			
			Great thread. Any hint of U2 coming back...sadly passed us by last time (from a fans point of view that is).
		    It will be better when people start caring more for content than form. Being seen may also translate as liking the music, privately, you cannot expect a discrete culture all of a sudden show authentic affection in a prestigeous environment. The fact that the musicians and loads of listeners do not consider it prestigeous (the partisan opposite) is irrelevant.    
Les Grottes are great; in GE. Anti prestigeous. Weird enough stuff.
		    Lead from the front: dancing and enjoying yourself is the perfect way to get your square metre of space and will encourage the others. I was, however, told off by a woman once at a Nicolas Jaar gig for dancing. I apologised and told her next time I wanted to have fun I'd stay at home and listen on my headphones. Some just can't abide happiness in others.
		     
Hahahah. I am used to lead from the stage   , the best kind of hedonistic leadership.    
Well - I agree with you. There are places that support actual fun. And I also think that people do not dance for the same reason other stuff doesn't get done here, worried about spontaneity/authenticity being perceived as impolite, rude.    
I dance when I feel like it. Gigs, classrooms, balet halls, tents. I think the stiffness will change. A buddy of mine went to headphones party (4 diff music channels), she had to look for somebody dancing to the same stuff. Fun. And some rooms had no light. Gasp! Puritanism is on its way out of life.

			I am not sure if anybody else feels the same way, but I am really looking forward to seeing Coldplay in concert (again)! If I am not mistaken, they are due to play at the Letzigrund on Saturday 26 May. Would anybody happen to know when tickets go on sale and if there are any seats/sections to avoid in the Letzigrund for concerts? 
Viva la Vida!
		 
			
			Thanks for the reminder- was just watching them on UK X Factor and had forgotten how amazing they are- def want to get tickets. Don't know what time they go on sale- could be midnight??? Let me know if you hear anything in the meantime
		 
			
			Tuesday 13th December, 8am       
There is a separate stock set aside for Raiffeisen members. No special price, but the tickets will last longer.       
120.- certainly is enough for a ticket though - even if its Coldplay!
		 
			
			I have parted with half a thousand Francs to get four tickets for the show at Letzigrund. Quite frankly, ticket prices are a scandal these days, but whilst muppets like myself are willing to spend the cash, then they'll stay at that level.    
Apart from the one Locarno show, I've seen all the Coldplay shows in Switzerland and the guys put on a good concert, even in the rain in Bern back in 2009. Can't say I like a single song from their new CD, but anything from ""Parachutes"" or ""A Rush of Blood"" is worth experiencing live.           Agreed. Used to be a huge Coldplay fan when they first started out and been to two of their concerts. I simply dont get the Mylo Xyloto album. Its as if its not them at all.   
Their performance on X Factor on Sunday confirmed that all the bouncing and all the impessive stage sets in all the world can't make them sound like anything other than bland and out of ideas.
		 
			
			I hope you all managed to get tickets....??? 
I'm hitting through the roof! I woke up early to grab tickets - I got the Golden Circle but really didn't know you have to really be ""standing"" in front of the stage! Grr... !  
...and I paid good money from them CHF 387.50 for 2 - feel like a right punter! 
If there is anyone out there who has managed to get seated tickets, let me know if you want to be up and close to the band in exchange for a seated place!
		 
			
			Another good reason for leaving Zurich !        Noooo...standing at a Rock/Pop Concert. I'm speechless. In the end they even move/dance there...horrible.
		    haaa! Actually professor, for vertically challenged people like me, its sometimes better to sit and dance from the comfort of a seat versus trying to jump up and see whats going on and smelling peoples' armpits    
			
			Got my ticket today to see them, standing ticket! Cannot wait! :-) Went to see them in 2009, blew me away, and looking forward to this album tour!
		    Let's just say that seeing Coldplay live makes me weak in the knees and I need my seat!!
		 
			
			I just know that I'm going to have the usual Swiss crowd around me at this show. The type that feel it is their God-given duty to hold a loud conversation about Migros Cumulus card points during ""Politik"". That really gets on my nips.   
If you listen to probably one of the greatest live concerts of all time (The Who - Live at Leeds) you could hear a pin drop during the quiet bits, no idiots shouting out obscenities or other garbage. I guess that having Townshend standing menacingly above you ready to ax you with his guitar would also be a good incentive to shut the hell up.
		 
			
			Coldplay fans are rather para...para...paranoid.     
			
			In regards to ticket prices.. 
Having once worked in the industry I can attest to the huge amount of logistics and personnel involved for a single two hour show. A band like coldplay probably transports its entire stage, as well as lighting, sound, props anything up to 20 truckloads worth. There is also the travelling crew, from lowly roadies, to managers, pr spivs, merchandisers, wardrobe, the list goes on and on.  Probably at least 50 bodies if not more. Everybody has to be transported, accommodated, fed it goes on and on. Not to mention hiring the venue, local crew and commissions paid out for the ticket sales. Now bands like the Stones charging 300 a ticket are killing the pig, but generally, bands make money from tours through the mechanise and extra album sales. So its not so bad really.. enjoy the show    
			
			So today, they are not selling anymore?
		 
			
			It looks like ticketcorner.ch is not selling tickets anymore. Just had a look on viagogo and the cheapest tickets are going for 185 Francs a piece. Ouch. Are there any other places worth looking at to snag a ticket?
		 
			
			Look at alltickets.ch, ricardo.ch or go for a ticket in another country
		 
			
			I ordered my tickets via ticketcorner.ch but I'm still waiting for them to arrive ... starting to get a bit worried    
			
			Mine arrived about 3 days ago. Did you get an email saying they'd been dispatched ? (I did).
		 
			
			are these still available anywhere?
		 
			
			At ticketcorner all tickets are sold out, except the vip tickets for around 600 sfr a piece. 
Have a loook at ricardo.ch, alltickets.ch or look for a ticket in another country, because the prices for the ticket at allticket.ch start at 199 sfr a piece, for example you pay 77 Euro for a standing ticket in Munich, a return ticket to munich is available from 88 Euros. 
Accomodation in Munich starts at around 40 Euros per Night.......
		 
			
			Will have to buy tickets, last Coldplay show I saw in the US was excellent.
		 
			
			I can't find tickets anywhere, I sadly missed the pre sale   Anyone have, or know anybody that has extras and is willing to sell? Please PM me!    
			
			Love ColdPlay, very sad that tickets show soldout. I am up for buying if anyone has an extra.. PM me. Thanks!
		 
			
			Word of advice: just show up at the concert. You can ALWAYS buy tickets in fron of the venue. Always. I have done that countless times. Just be patient. Wait as long as possible. The tickets get cheaper by the minute. The best deals can be made a couple of minutes before the show starts. As there is usually a supporting act you can wait until they started or are about to start. Tell the people selling tickets that you are willing to buy but that you won't pay more than the official price. They will laugh at you in the beginning but in the end it will you who will be laughing at them  . Trust me. Been there done that and got some T-shirts ;-)
		 
			
			ummm I just checked and the prices have gone way up.  
Because Im not sure if ill be here in May or not,  how bad are my chances of getting at least 2 tickets around April? or on the flip side if I purchase the tickets at a higher price today, will i be able to sell them if Im unable to go? I dont want to miss this opportunity because I know for sure they aren't coming to Pakistan....atleast in my lifetime...      really...?? will they be able to handle haggling for coldplay tickets from a woman in hijab?   I cant seem to picture it...but right now Im not letting go of any options.            I went to the Rock Oz'Arènes Festival this summer and had so much fun,but I'll wear a mask next time...       i couldn't agree more,they have sold out and now have that rhianna on their album,sorry to say but when i was listening to the album it was thrown right out of the window when i heard her voice/i miss the true band
		 
			
			Got my ticket sorted. Anyone know who the support act is?
		 
			
			Anyone have an extra ticket to coldplay???  Would love to go, GA is fine! Just moving to Zurich this month and want to cross seeing Coldplay off my bucket list!   
Thanks.
		 
			
			I will be in Switzerland as of April and really would like to see Coldplay - what is it like in Swiss with scalpers ???
		 
			
			I TOTALLY missed out on this concert sale and my daughters want to hurt me . Does anybody have 4 tickets to sell or know where I can get 4 for under the price of a small automobile? If not, enjoy the show. If Coldplay is half as good as they were last time in Bern then they will be twice as good as any concert you have ever seen!
		 
			
			Anyone with an extra ticket for the Coldplay do at Zurich??

			Do you like, have to wear a fancy evening dress or something?    
Only time I was in an Opera was here:       
I had to wear something very fancy, and walk on fancy 10 cm high-heels over flooded sidewalks...   Somehow I associate Opera to this:          No, it's a Volksvorstellung for the poor people who have just two pair of trousers and one pair of shoes.
		    Good   I always feel out of place among really fancy people. Will check with better half if we are free.
		     
Is his half swiss part planning the whole thing.
		 
			
			Thank you for organising this. I would love a 70chf seat please, unless this is one of the theatres that actually has a better view from balcony seats, than from the front rows.  I am happy with whatever you get , really.
		      What I meant is, that it's way too far ahead! March 2012! Acceptable long term plans are 1 week ahead at the most..
		    I will try to get some boxes which have most of the categories covered (P1/P3/P4/P5). This way we can all stay together more or less. Have a look at the 3D Ticketing, first floor, Loge 10 for example.
		    Or as MariaMaria would say: I can't make plans this far ahead because I could be dead by then.
		    She sounds like my mother. It's horrible trying to plan anything with mommy. Her answer to anything with more than 2 days of advance is always ""I don't know if I'm alive then...""   
It's exasperating!
		 
			
			And the wind will gently blow, on the calm sea 
Che bella idea professore, grazie
		 
			
			What a cool crowd is forming!  
I happen to have  cd and am going to listen to it every day.    
I feel like Cinderella.  I've never been to the opera.    
			
			OK I am convinced. If I am not around I will donate my ticket to my stunt double.       very true - I look forward to meeting some of the friendliest EF members  
although I must add that my husband is the mozart fan at home. he actually physically listens to don giovanni on his ipod in the tram, believe it or not    
thanks a lot for this great idea, prof. taratonga!
		    We gonna rock the house!   
I'm just waiting for my favorite opera, Mascagnis ""Cavalleria Rusticana"".
		 
			
			I looked in the web link, in the Order ticket, and it says ""There is no data for the event""   
Are the tickets already sold out? 
and checking the other dates, the prices are much higher... are the prices correct?   
If they are correct, coming +1, whatever category will be ok!   
Thanks for organizing!
		 
			
			For the so called ""Volksvorstellungen"" tickets will be available just 1 month in advance. On ""3D Ticketing"" you can see the seat categories. Feel free to subscribe.   
Prices range from 15.- (P5) to 70.- (P1).            
Cavalleria Rusticana is very cool, I saw it in Milan a few years ago.    
My absolute favorite is  , it was the first opera I saw as a kid many years ago, and the emotions never left me. Here in a wonderful version by Maria Callas.   
This opera is coming back to Verona in Summer 2012 - as MariaMaria said, if I am alive, I shall be there! EF field trip?   
Thankf Prof. for organizing!
		 
			
			Federica, si, andiamo a Verona !!!!     
I love the opera, t'will be a nice way to enjoy    
			
			Ok I'm bringing a +1 please two 70chf seats next to you please!
		 
			
			Prof, can I jump in on this deal? I was looking to get tickets online and I cant tell if they are available or not. I'll be in town with my mom and we are heading the next day to the Lucerne Festival for opening night. this would be the feather in the cap. Any two would be appreciated....
		    For these events tickets are only available one month prior to the show. I will try to get our places on the first date ticketing is available around the 23rd of February. I will also send my account details to everyone who has subscribed beginning of February to make payment directly to me. Tickets for the 2nd and 3rd class are also very good, f.e. in the boxes they are just in the 2nd or 3rd row.
		 
			
			So, the Payment Information is sent out to all subscribers. If anyone else is interested please subscribe to this as soon as possible. Thx
		 
			
			Thank you so much for taking care of this. Wired 140 CHF for two tickets, but will honestly take whatever you get your hands on in case you need to redistribute.  Again a really class move on your part putting this together.
		 
			
			I'm excited.
		    Plus one. Check your PM and as Ashahan said - I wired CHF 140 but will take whatever available.    
Fed
		    But it's hardly enough to buy me a ticket to Rio.
		       
I just asked my hubby(he is AN opera-goer), he is now playing it. errrrrr... 
Fortunately(?) for me, he couldn't get many opera tickets here in Switzerland. When he arrived here the very first thing he done was checking the website for tickets. But most of tickets were sold out. lol.  
In London he was a member of royal opera house which enabled him to book his ticket earlier than public sale and even a famile member. 
Happiest moment for me was when Royal Opera House closed for holidays in summer time. Don't get me wrong. It is ok and sometimes enjoyable but having it too often wasn't.     
In Verona, seat must be selected carefully otherwise you will be grilled.     
We also were in Milan for one of Verdi's Opera played by Placido Domingo. But for me, it wasn't cool.  
Why? at that time there was volcano eruption, so no flight technically to nowhere from UK(it was a total disaster!). Our flight was cancelled but he was determined to go. So he bought Eurostar tickets to Paris n overnight in Paris and then, train to Lyon, Geneva and Milan.    
It was pretty hectic even on our way back there was no flight so took a train(harder to get we managed to get tickets but missed it in Nice but managed to get on other train, normally wasn't possible to hop on other train with tickets weren't designed to travel on that train, but at that time, worst for many, workers union(?) in France(beside volcano eruption!!) were on strike. Many trains were cancelled. So exception to the rule, tickets for the same destination, were allowed to travel on other trains.    
Yeh, everywhere was packed by people to get hold of tickets if there was any(fully booked again for most of destinations) even rental cars were Fully booked up. Worst of all I nearly got into physical(?) fight with a staff at Nice after he made some rubbish remarks but then, I was dragged out of station by my hubby at the point I was about to punch him. I was near eruption after all. It was a minute that I got so angry. Not only from his remarks but full incidents I had for 2 days.  
My hubby doesn't like arguing with people or get angry at people, especially on the street in public, he'd rather let it go n forget.    
However, a nightmare wasn't finished here. When we arrived in Lille, there was no hotel rooms nearby station. And the last thing, after checked-in, my hubby wanted was to have brekkie in the room. He couldn't have that in the room brekkie as I didn't allow(?) him to hv that luxury after these disasters!!!   
Back to journey, after a night we took a train to Calais then Dover by ferry and London by train. Then, my hubby went to work straight away. 
I told him if he was ever gonna do this kind of thing, he could do only over my dead body.     
Funny enough, only thing he complained was the brekkie he couldn't have. The most Romantic thing according to him, What the heck!!!   
Your offer is very good but I am NOT telling him about it.
		 
			
			Apero for this event will be at:     PurPur  Seefeldstrasse 9 
8008 Zürich       
from 5.30pm to 6.40pm.
		 
			
			Brilliant! looking forward to it.
		 
			
			Shit! do I miss this place   Worked there for years ,as stage hand
		 
			
			Profesor ! are you try to piss me off ?? I just went true the opera program ,noting like that here in OTTAWA ,shame   But I plan a trip to NY ,Metro this fall    
			
			I am so excited!!!!!       Oh yes, one day left.    
After the Opera we can go to Oliver Twist for some Karaoke....
		    Ooooh so much excitement in one day! Looking forwards!
		    Brilliant idea - we're in!
		    That is a brilliant idea, as Crumbs said!!! I hope I won't scare my OH too much when I will be singing ""these boots are made for walking...""      
On second thought, if he was gonna be scared, he should have been scared already a long time ago!   
(insert evil smile here)
		    Remind me not to wear heels then! It's Friday isn't it, so there are night trains?
		 
			
			I only saw this event on EF today as I don't visit the website so often. Would have definitely signed up for it if I had caught it earlier.   
Hope you will organize this again so that I can join next time.   
Have a great time there, whoever is going    
			
			A huge thank you to you, Prof., for organizing this night out.   
Awesome company, we had a really great time.           
			
			Mille Grazie Prof T!   
Thank you so much for the huge effort you made in getting us all tickets and organizing everything. This was my first time ever at the Opera and it will NOT be my last! It was WONDERFUL!    
I had a brilliant time with everyone, especially you, Crumbs and friend. 
If you need some help organizing the next one, I volunteer.       
			
			Many thanks to Prof T for the superbe organization, and to everyone for the excellent company and great time. And remember, ""You've been a-messin' where you shouldn't have been a-messin, yeah..."".     
			
			Such a goood idea! Bravo!
		 
			
			Thanks everyone for a wonderful evening. Guess ""Cosi fan tutte"" was the right choice as so many haven't been to the Opera before. Next time we will get the tickets beforehand and the announce it on here.
		 
			
			a very belated THANK YOU all for the lovely company and especially Prof. for organizing.  
OH was absolutely enthusiastic - couldn't stop clapping, actually. we had great seats and greatly enjoyed the show which I think was qualitatively excellent.    
we are looking forward to the next shows (Nibelungenlied? )!   
PS the idea of the pre-show Apéro was also brilliant!
		 
			
			Another belated thanks here, great night out, would love to do it again

			Has anyone been to the ""International Alphorn Festival"" < >, in Nendaz? We're thinking of taking a diversion from our planned Haute Route hike this coming summer to check it out. We'd be delighted to hear about places to stay (or avoid!) in Nendaz, or to get any other tips. Our current plans have us taking a bus from Arolla to Nendaz, staying two nights there, and then busing back to La Sage to continue the trek.

			I would LOVE to go to his concert it I ever got a chance. I remember the tune for Titan watches and Old Spice after shave which used him to create mind blowing tunes which are even a sensation after 20 odd years.   
Do any1 love his music and would it ever be possible to witness him in Swiss or even Europe where he could perform, is he famous here ?   
Any thoughts    
P.S One of his best moments in the history of music.        I don't think he'll ever play a concert inside of an airplane (Swiss) but you could check his website to see if he's ever going to play "" "":   "	1	5	 Jun 2010	['198', '52']	Is Yanni Famous in Switzerland.	singabhadur	160	1039	Concerts

			Hi   
So always having dreamed of attending a Bryan Adams concert, I thought this was my chance. 
But the tickets on ticketscorner.ch are already sold out (they went on sale on 7th December 2011). By the time I discovered it, its already unavailable.   
I do see quite a few tickets on this website>   but at a markup of 50% or more than the actual price    
Since this is the first time I have actually tried to book a concert ticket here, it has come as a surprise. Any suggestions/hints if I could get tickets at more 'humane' prices?
		 
			
			try at ricardo.ch, prices start from  105 sfr (Standing ticket) or alltickets.ch, prices start at 139 sfr (Standing Ticket)
		    Thanks. So is it like people buy tickets in bulk and then they start auctioning them off on the Internet?
		 
			
			I already said this on here and I will say it again: just show up at the venue and buy the ticket there. The longer you wait the cheaper it gets. Best is to wait until the support act starts (usually the time stated as start of concert, i.e. most likely 20.00)   
Might see you there    
			
			I will be there!
		    Alright. Will follow your lead! :-)
		 
			
			Is he still touring (well apparently). Saw him in 1987 at my first ""real"" rock concert and remembering it as being quite good...    
Then he started the whole Robin Hood thing and we parted company...
		 
			
			Any idea which band is opening?  Saw Bryan in frankfurt few years ago and the bare naked ladies opened...something for any Canadians ..
		    Heather Nova
		 
			
			Does anyone know roughly what time the concert would finish? We live in canton Solothurn and are trying to decide whether we drive to Zurich on friday and brave Zurich traffic (and can't drink...) or we go by train. The last train home leaves Zurich HB at midnight. Thoughts anyone?
		    Generally concerts end around 2300ish but as it is in Hallenstadium ou also need to get back to HB along with several thousand other people... Wich should be fun       Almost all concerts at the Hallenstadion finish by 23.00 in my experience precisely so people can catch the train. When we saw Lenny Kravitz there last November he even referenced the fact that his people kept telling him he had to finish because of the trains before he played the final song.
		 
			
			Thanks guys. Last connection from stadium is 11.45 so fingers crossed should make it in time. Really Appreciate the help!
		 
			
			I'll be there, my first concert in Zurich..hope it doesn't get as insane as it gets at my place!

                                             Superstar rapper and hip hop icon Snoop Dogg readies for his highly  anticipated album Tha Blue Carpet Treatment releasing on November 21st  through Doggystyle/Geffen. Early buzz from industry insiders promise a  classic album complete with the reunion of Snoop and Dr. Dre with three  bangers from the dynamic duo. This classic pairing marks the duos first  collaborative effort in approximately five years and promises to make  history once again.    
Tha Blue Carpet Treatment is a return to the original sound that put the  Long Beach rapper on the map with Snoop keeping it gangsta on each and  every record. Following the street single, Vato, produced by Pharrell  and featuring B-Real, comes the highly anticipated second single,  Thats That produced by Nottz and featuring R&B crooner R. Kelly.  This catchy and melodic song was most added at Urban and Rhythmic  formats, proving it is shaping up to be another platinum hit for the  West Coast Boss. Snoop says, That's That is theme music for a  classy gangsta party - that's when you ladies pull out the high heels  and the playas pull out the three-piece suits. You'll see in the video!  Me and R. Kelly had a lot of fun shooting this one."" The video for  Thats That will make its MTV Prime Time Premiere on November 7th.    
Throughout the album, Snoop takes it back to the hood showcasing the  gritty realness that helped shape his status as a cultural icon. XXL  writes, Snoops lyrical fire seems resurrected, as he delivers arguably  his most consistently scorching work post-Doggystyle. Thirsty fans  will be thrilled with the thought provoking song Imagine, produced by  and featuring Dr. Dre, which reflects on what life would be like for the  California natives without hip hop. The signature Dre piano riff is  complimented by the DAngelo sung chorus, marking the first time fans  have heard DAngelo in six long years. Another album favorite is club  banger Psst, produced by Jamie Foxx, N8 and Brainz and features Jamie  Foxxs signature falsetto on the hook. The album also features two  collaborations with Akon, Bosss Life produced by Dr. Dre and the  current radio smash I Wanna Love You, the latter also being on Akons  upcoming album. Of the album, Snoop says, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment is  my presentation to the world on what it means to be the King of the West  Coast. I really worked extra hard on making this one perfect and got  the best of the best among my homies in the music game- Skateboard P,  Timbaland, R. Kelly, D'Angelo... and you know when me and Dr. Dre get  together - it's a monster.""    
As a gift to loyal fans, Snoop is treating 9 winners to Tha Blue Carpet  Treatment. Nine winning tickets will be placed inside random CDs of the  album which reward the lucky recipient with a diamond Ice link watch.  The grand prize winner will win a diamond Ice Link watch worth $100,000.  Three winners will be prized with diamond Ice Link watches worth  $10,000 and five winners will get diamond Ice Link watches worth $5,000.    
The excitement for the album will continue to build as Snoop will be  performing at this years MTV European Music Awards on November 2nd,  marking the rappers first televised performance of the year. He will  follow it up with a performance at this years BET Hip Hop Awards, which  will air on November 17th, where his feature film, Bossn Up is  nominated for Best Hip Hop Movie.    
As if Snoop were not busy enough, he also recently released his first  book, Love Dont Live Here No More, a story loosely based on his own  lifes trials and tribulations. The book, co-written by playwright David  E. Talbert, is the first in a series of novels called Doggy Tales that  takes readers from the unforgiving streets of Long Beach to the bright  lights of show business.
		 
			
			A well-thumbed saying involving knitting needles and ears springs to mind.....   
Anyway, we went to Frauenfeld for 1 day our 1st year here. Line-up included: 
Paul Weller 
Beautiful South 
Oasis 
Sheryl Crow 
REM headliner.     
What an absoeffinglutely great day that was.
		    My first Frauenfeld Openair included Bowie from about 10 m away. That was unbelievable.
		 
			
			I went last year and Eminem was headliner.  Good festival.  Open airs in Switzerland usually have good set up and nice camp grounds.
		    Last year was a quality line-up - Eminem, Jay Z, Nas + D Marley, Dizzy Rascal.. 
I don't (personally) think this years is as good as a line-up, but it was a great festival, well organised, nice atmosphere so would definitely recommend it.
		 
			
			I think it's pathetic that on the posters Public Enemy are listed down on the 5th line. 
What a bunch of (c)rap. Best rap group in history, hands down, reduced to that. It's insulting. The content of their rhymes about real black issues like racism, black rights, drugs (anti) are(were) so real, much harder, more true, genuine, deep and intelligent compared to a lot of current rappers rapping (with less ability) about women, cars, money and drugs. But I guess that's what white folks want to hear about. 
Rant over.  
Awesome line up though. Such big names. I'd be interested in seeing Cypress Hill cos I've never seen them live before. 
It's almost too good to be true. 
Do any of these main acts ever cancel / fail to show at these Swiss music festivals?
		    Yeah---well different countries, different popularity of bands.   
Last year I saw Stone Temple Pilots in St. Gallen, with essentially a handfull of people--meanwhile they have consistently sold out stadiums in North America for more than 15 years.    
Social Distortion also seems to get little recognition at Greenfield.   
I saw Cypress Hill 3 years ago in Frauenfeld---they were AMAZING! really sick show, and HUGE blanket of funny smelling smoke engulfing the entire crowd. One of the best concert experiences I've had.
		 
			
			I would like to attend this festival this year travelling over from the UK. Can anybody advise how easy (or not)  it is to get there from Zurich Airport?
		    Very easy--direct train (with one stop on the way).  
Trip is about a half hour, free shuttle bus in frauenfeld from the train station to the grounds.   
Full train ticket price 28.40 round trip.
		 
			
			Thank you to everyone for your replies. It would seem the train is easy enough to get us to the town.   
Has anybody here been to this festival before? I am trying to find if there are any camping companies that sell equipment at the festival? There are companies in the UK (Cosy Campers for example) who have stalls at the festivals for u to buy ur stuff there or u can order online and pick it up in the festival to save u travelling with it. I'm wondering if anybody knows if there is an equivalent at this festival?    
Many thanks
		    I've gone to the festival very frequently for the last 20 odd years. I have never seen camping equipment sold at the festival, but the migros/coop in Frauenfeld usually stock up on the camping necessities. Last year we picked up a canopy tent for very cheap on the Saturday as the sun was scortching.
		 
			
			Thank you - that's a great help to know. Much appreciated.

			Well here goes....    
For chitter and chatter about gigs up and coming to run along side the wonderfully implemented calendar events and for the numpty simpletons like me who prefer the old fashioned way      
hopefully this will replace Jot's great 'Zurich Gig Guide' from the past - but will please all the unfortunate bumpkins that live outside the canton of Zurich    
			
			Why is it that some people have so much difficulty dealing with change?   
IMO This thread is pointless and selfish.
		 
			
			I was sure I was going to get groans for that and they will all be from people living in or around Zürich...   
When in real life a small group of people sharing the same interests (for example Zürich inhabitants, blondes, Audi TT owners, whatever...) joins up with a bigger group (for example Switzerland inhabitants, ladies who like to dye their hair, Audi owners...), you can then tell them a 1000 times that it doesn't make sense them staying together in their small group, that they should open up to the other people...If they don't want to change they won't.
		    well then go to this   instead? we cater for all    
			
			Primal Scream Xtra 16 th August.
		    Are you going Annie and Nicky? We may have to re-arrange my schedule a bit so we can go because they are good live.
		 
			
			We are Nigel, booked our tickets today.
		    Not sure yet - not listened to any of their recent stuff
		 
			
			The latest album is really good. Check out the website    
We now have tickets as well.       
I am also wondering about the Delilahs at Kaufleuten on 13th August.
		    Don't you think that there are Primal Scream fans living outside of Zurich?
		    Primal Scream are playing in Zurich therefore it is a 'Zurich Gig' - I created another thread to post gigs in Switzerland should anyone wish to....
		    Grrr.... 
Zurich is in Switzerland.
		    Why don't we have ""Yawn"" button as well as Thanks & Groan?
		 
			
			Well you all found this thread about Primal Scream playing in Zurich so whats the fuss.      PS I dont live in Zurich Kanton.      I found it because I actually live in Zurich and am registered to this thread.   
But why should a Primal Scream fan who does not live in Zurich have to wade through 10 pages of Zurich concerts to discover that his favourite band is going to play in Switzerland?   
If you want to keep this thread fair enough but please also add the events to the Concerts Calendar!
		    Who let you in? Anyways, this thread is far more pointless and selfish, it's only for Zurich Stadt       True but we should also have a ""This poster is being selfish"" button that would be worth 10 groans.
		    Why register to something that seems to cause you so much angst    
Anyone only using this ""Heads Up"" thread or the EF concert guide is going to miss out on plenty of things they might like anyway. It contains a mere fraction of what is going on. Compare it to a comprehensive gig guide eg   ,   etc   
Real gig guides exists elsewhere, so I certainly can't be bothered replicating them on EF. Call me selfish if you must, but it only caters for those who like to be.....       
			
			We have the Concert Calendar, we also have the Zurich Gig Guide thread and the Switzerland Gig Guide thread - is this not enough?    
Martin if you want to add Primal Scream into the calendar then go ahead - Mannie Organ decided to post it here and that is entirely her choice but it does not stop you creating an event   
After the demise of the Zurich gig guide some people (me included) missed having a general thread to chat about and mention up and coming gigs.   
I am sure people living elsewhere can still look at at this thread if they see a new post added to it - especially if they are interested in music and are willing to travel - if someone decided to create a Basel Gig Guide I would follow it, just because i Live in Zurich doesn't mean i wouldn't be interested in gigs in other cities   
where's the flogging a dead horse icon for this bleedin topic......
		 
			
			Martin - you groaned Mannie Organ for merely posting a gig that is happening in Zurich in the Zurich Gigs ""heads Up"" thread, do you really believe that deserves a groan? as far as she is aware she is posting in the right place... really some people.....
		    The difference between the EF concerts calendar and a general events website is that the concerts mentioned on here are focused towards the expat community.    
According to your reasoning if information that was already available on the Internet should not be added to the EF then there wouldn't be much content on the EF.   
What I don't understand is why you can't create a Primal Scream Concert thread on the calendar for the 16th August and then have your discussion there: ""Are you going?"", ""No I am going on holiday"", ""Pity because Primal Scream are good"" etc... ?
		    Go for it Martin, very happy for you to go and post the event in the calendar, jeeze I'll do it if it will make you happy?
		    No I groaned at her because she knows of a good concert that could interest other expats but decided not to add it to the Calendar.
		    everytime this thread gets bumped to the top, i think there's a new concert...       I posted it in the Zurich thread because the bloody concert is in Zurich,end of story.          Most of the gigs I go to are with Swiss people. They have remarkably the same taste in music as ""expats"". EF is intended to be a ""Community portal for English-speaking people in Switzerland"", not an expat ghetto.      People do often refer to outside web sources. The real value of EF is in the info that isn't so easy to find, and peoples experience and opinions.      I've not been overwhelmed by the volume of your contributions to this calendar (was it zero or nil?). It's a bit rich to be handing out tit-for-tat groans to contributors and using that as an excuse.
		    That is the whole point of my groan. If you post your comments and information somewhere in the middle of a gigantic Zurich Concerts thread it will not be easy to find.
		     gigantic one and a bit pages.
		    Exactly the problem, and not exactly unexpected.  That is why I wonder why there are mutliple gig threads.  It serves no purpose other than to keep those in Zurich happy and the rest of the board uninformed.
		 
			
			I give up.      see everyone uses things differently, I prefer this way rather than the concerts calendar, the gig is posted and then if no one adds a comment to that event then it gets lost in the pile - whereas I see a new gig added to this and it appears in 'new posts', if i decide i want to go to the event mentioned I put it in my own calendar, I find this solution easier, however i appreciate that you don't, we can't please everyone and I think it will just have to be give and take   
If in the future you see a gig mentioned on this or the other thread and you want to create an event in the concerts calendar then go ahead but don't groan at people if they have chosen this method if that's what THEY prefer   
Nicky
		    For the moment but by August it would theoretically be longer.
		    It's a conspiracy for sure.   
Magnolia Electric Co.  25 Sept  El Lokal , Z*****
		    And why not post it to the general concerts thread?  Do you specificaly not want others to know about it?  Or do you feel too many concerts go on in the rest of the country that it would be lost?
		    Cyrus I didn't post it in here but I actually advised Mannie Organ to post it in here so yes slapped wrist - but it is actually a Zurich concert, not exclusive to Zurichers but it is happening in Zurich - the thread exists and it seemed a suitable place   
I think you are being a bit pedantic over this... is it really all that important? a gig is happening in Zurich and it was posted in the Zurich Gigs 'Heads Up' thread       It is pedantic, but it's not just me being pedantic is it?  I just feel everyone is better of with a general concert thread, but those from Zurich can't seem to post their concerts to a thread that doesn't have the word ""Zurich"" in it.
		    I think 'those' from Zurich can (if they want) Mannie Organ isn't even bloody from Zurich she posted it here because the event is IN Zurich, quite a logical decision do you not think, when confronted with 2 threads, one called Switzerland Gig Guide and the other Zurich Gigs ""heads up""    
Basically don't blame the messenger, it's the mods decision what to do with the two threads and so far they have been left as they are, so...... a user comes along and posts a zurich gig in the zurich gig thread and she gets groaned and hassled about it       
			
			Ok, to summarise:   
There was a Zurich Concerts thread, people weren't happy and made a General concerts thread. Then people weren't happy because gigs in their area were getting lost in the big General concerts thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... People still weren't happy so there was a Concerts forum created.    
People still weren't happy because they could only discuss a particular concert in a thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... then the non Zurich people got pissed off...     
FFS people, no one is going to be happy all the time. Its not the end of the world, get off your high horses (Did Hsiang ever find out where to procure one?) and go to whatever concerts you want to. If a gig is in Zurich why can't the people that live in Zurich discuss it in a Zurich based thread. If they were going to go to a gig in Luzern I'm sure they wouldn't object to it being in a Luzern gigs thread.    
I think a certain amount of ""cop the f**K on"" is needed here.
		    Actually the old Zurich concert threads served well for all concerts in the country, because most concerts happen in Zurich, there were no other threads.  I thought a title change would be appropriate to reflect the actual content of the thread, but obviously, that was just too much.
		    Well then you should have left well enough alone and not tried to fix what was not broken.       But why on earth do you guys have to have these general threads why not simply create an individual thread for each concert and discuss the specifics there.   
That was Nathu's aim when he created the Concerts calendar.   
This reminds of procedural language programmers who couldn't understand object-oriented programming: Now every concert is one object.
		    Because maybe they don't want to!   
You are still perfectly entitled to post the concert in the concerts thread should you so desire.
		 
			
			It's annoying me now how I bang on about it, I understand how some people prefer a single thread and some like the events, but I simply cannot understand why we have 2 seperate stickies simply confusing the issue.     
All gigs posted here will be in Switzerland, most will be in Zurich, why is it so hard to not have a single thread with a title that accurately reflects the contents ""Upcoming Concerts"" or some such, then acts will be picked up by all who might not otherwise consider a trip out of town.  Instead we have 2 threads, or one thread with an inaccurate title.
		 
			
			Now that 50% of the dissenters have annoyed themselves, can we move to the next part of this thread cycle please?   
Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism -> thread users discuss thread -> long period of silence -> thread users think it safe -> Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism ->
		 
			
			Er, I support the use of the Concerts Calendar - which should be merged with the main calendar IMO; let's have a huge 'What's On' section with overview - rather than having lots of different threads.   
There was some arcane rule about not posting an event on the calendar if you weren't intending to attend; surely that's not necessary? Should there be a concert, is it not easier to have it on the calendar? One concert has no relevence to any other and threads like this spin outta control... although something is better than nothing.   
And it's Zürchers, not Zürichers       Oh yes, above it all aren't we? but can't possibly post to a concerts thread without Zurich being in the title.
		 
			
			right i have to dash off to catch a flight very shortly but as an interim would it make everyone happy if I merge this thread with the Switzerland Gig Guide thread and just have the one thread from now on    
The Zurich guide i really don't think was created intentionally to p!ss off Cyrus and Martin but it seems to have done anyway and I think they'll be banging on about it until the cows come home, so I'll merge and we'll just have one generic thread - which will eliminate their the 'them and us' belief   
Agreed?
		 
			
			Right threads merged - it's all a bit of a jumble - i will attempt to edit it when i get chance
		 
			
			I was going to post earlier, but it felt a little childish   
For fans of electro pop, the excellent   are coming to CH   
Stall 6, Zurich, 2/6 and 
Volkshaus, Basel on 3/6
		    Can I now be picky and ask for it to be renamed ""Switzerland Gigs ""Heads Up"" or ""Switzerland Gigs Discussion"" or ""Switzerland Rough Gig Guide""? Cos it aint a gig guide.
		    ah it could have gone in the other thread    
			
			eskimo joe(super aussie band) are playing Bier Huebli in Bern on the 27th October.             
I'm going. anyone from Zurich feel like grabbing a train to Bern check them out?   
(to avoid a sh!t fight based re: the usual argument: Zurich vs rest of the known universe, if someone feels like popping this on the gig-calendar please feel free. i don't know how. :-) )   
they will also be at Gurten for those who are going   
cheers

			thanks UM.

			Heard a rumour the amazing Not The Sensational Alex Harvey Band will play in ETH StuZ this September. Not to be missed!
		 
			
			MUSE playing the Hallenstadion in Zurich - Nov 18th... 
Tickets on sale as of today       You've made my day!
		 
			
			B*llocks only seating left!!
		 
			
			Yeah, I think that its because you were only allowed to buy the tickets when they were released if you were a VIP member of ticketcorner.com. Totally sucks as now all the 'ticket dregs' are left. Anyhow, I managed to buy 2 tickets for the UK so will be seeing them there.    
			
			Someone wants to come?           
Thats gonna be my first concert here! Great start    
			
			I wouldn't mind going to see Gossip tonight at Kaufleuten, but they sold out at starticket, does anyone know if they sell tickets on the door?   
I don't want to travel all the way to Zurich and find I can't get in.
		 
			
			A bit short notice but, tonight I can completely recommend both of the bands that will be playing in the restaurant, if it rains, or just outside on the terrace if it doesn't, at the Rote Fabrik. The bands are, in no particular order, Sein and Attwenga. 
Thankyou for your time.

			Wilco play the Volkshaus on November 11th, tickets from CHF55.-   
Peaches plays 8th September, from CHF55.-   
Goran Bregovic also plays there 23rd April, 2010 ( ) from CHF65.-
		    play the Club at the Theater Spektakel in Zürich Tuesday 18th August, bringing some spooky Ethiopean jazz grooves to the shores of the lake of Zurich. If you weren't in Addis Ababa before 1974, you'll know their music from the Jim Jarmusch film 'Broken Flowers'    
Fire        
			
			This used to work much better when it was a single thread called Zurich Gig Guide 2009 in social events.                      play the Mascotte in Zurich again on December 5th. They're also supporting Muse at the Hallenstadion on November 18th. A good show       It doesn't work because you aren't using the system correctly.
		 
			
			Martin he is using the system how he would like to use it - please quit with groans because someone disagrees with you.   
There are many who no longer benefit from the new system me included - I know a lot of time and effort went into creating the concerts calendar but i feel it is not as effective as the handy gig guide thread we had before. I am finding out about less gigs now because people are just not posting them. It's quick and easy to post on here and many people are short of time and don't wish to create an event.   
So please, we know you don't like this method, but we don't like the other method so can we be grown up and not groan the users who would like to carry on down this route?   
Bannahead thanks for those 3 updates - I am sure in the old system these would have been announced sooner so I hope there are still tickets left for Temper Trap   
Cheers  
Nicky
		    ...It's not that we don't wish to creat an event, but we're following previous rules asking us not to create events if we don't intend / sure if we're going. This is a ""Heads Up"" thread.   
On that note, the rather loud and rocking  play the Rote Fabrik this coming Sunday 20th. Last time they played there were about 7 people in the Ziegel; one was a waiter, one at the bar, two groupies and me and my two mates   A private party!    
There're really quite good, despite the crowds...
		    I agree UM this is why i don't use this calendar event because a) I am unsociable and don't want a crowd tagging along with me at a gig   and b) sometimes I find out about a gig want to tell others but may not be going myself   
I just don't want to get into the whole gigs head up guide v concerts calendar debate again - there was no happy outcome the last time so why can't each person just do as they wish and post a gig ho they want?    
I like this method and it worked for many years and was updated regularly - at least 2 to 3 times a week a new gig would be posted on here and it was always my most favourote thread, it's now died a death and it's a shame    
			
			I haven't posted because I haven't seen anything I liked, it's been quiet over summer.   
Here's a couple to get the thread started again.   
25.10 Micachu and the Shapes / The Invisibles, Zukunft, Zurich   
12.11 Passion Pit, Alte Borse, Zurich   
20.11 The Field, Palace, St. Gallen   
25.11 Massive Attack, Eishalle Deutweg Winterthur   
3.12 Punks Jump Up, Hive, Zurich   
5.12 The Heavy, Palace, St. Gallen
		 
			
			Massive Attack, even antisocial me might be interested in that.       And where do I fit in to that description? I'm still fearful of crossing paths with the FOTL boys after the death look they gave me for buying a bottle of wine at the counter, it was for DaveA I tells ya! Don't think we'll see the likes of a FOTL & Black Mountain ""restaurant"" gig again soon   
Anyways here is my heads up, El Lokal to the rescue in October with varying shades of classy Americana in one hell of a week:   
Oct 18 - Mark Eitzel (American Music Club) 
Oct 22 - Joseph Arthur (last time I saw him was supporting R.E.M.) 
Oct 25 - Richmond Fontaine (Uncut Magazine's favourite story tellers)
		    Oh boy oh boy, Good work, El Lokal       Palace in St Gallen is a very good venue. Dont be scared to stand in front of the ""seat"" people though.        This is your opinion. And you are wrong.   
Along with Nicky, I do not want to reopen the whole Zurich Gig Guide versus Calendar discussion because it got boring very quickly. However, I will not be posting any events         
Sadly I won't be able to attend The XX gig and I am mightily disappointed.
		     
I like the recent albums but I'm not sure how it will work live.
		 
			
			Camera Obscura - 13th Oct - Abart, Zurich   
White Lies - 14th Nov - Kaufleuten, Zurich
		 
			
			Someone here on EF is nutty for them if remember correctly....   
Ultravox - Volkshaus Zurich - 15 April 2010   
with Midge Ure back up front.
		 
			
			It's a good week for indie music in Zürich with Au Revoir Simone on Tuesday and Yacht last night (which was great!).   
This evening Girls are playing at Exil.   
They have an interesting personal history, having grown up in the Children of God cult, being heavily involved with drugs and being adopted by a billionaire . . . or something.   
The music is psychedelic, influenced by the Beach Boys and shoegaze.
		 
			
			Who are the ""Girls"" ?     
as you can imagine, googling is pointless ... what do I google? Girls in Zurich, Girls group, Girls music ...
		 
			
			Anyone interested in seeing Alice In Chains in Fribourg start of december?   
A bit of a different band from their Grunge days, could be interesting
		    Well I did explain a little bit in my original post . . .   
More here:          If only I noticed earlier      
The debut album - imaginatively titled Album - is in the post   
Did you go? Were they good?       
And now for a plug          Unfortunately they started at 11.30 which was a bit late for a school night, so I decided against it.   
In other news . . . Patrick Wolf is playing at Mascotte on Wednesday. Anyone going? Or want to go? If you are it would be nice to meet up . . . PM me.       
			
			FYI - for any Aussies out there Eskimo Joe is playing tonight in Bern at the Bier Huebli           
cheers   
Nic
		 
			
			It would seem that The Joy Formidable are supporting The Temper Trap.   
Check out the video here      
How can you not love this band.
		 
			
			for the U2 fans out there, heard that they'll be playing in zurich next summer... can anyone confirm?
		   I'm looking forward to see KING AUTOMATIC at the longstreet bar 4.11.09 @2100h
Now that is something worth going to see..       I watched their video, what a bunch of w@nkers!
		    Not definitively but I can say the stage diagrams /architect plans have been drawn up (see  ), permission for a concert at Dubendorf Airfield has been granted, and I would expect a concert date sometime in the first half of September 2010 to be announced in the next week or two.
		 
			
			...are playing at the Volkhaus on 28.01.10...(I know I know, that's ages away, but being in CH...)   
I think tickets are around CHF50 , but you'll get excellent riffage for your frank, and the support is sure to be good....       
You know it makes sense!
		 
			
			Looking forward to the Temper trap in a few weeks. Got a few mates coming. Anyone interested in meeting up, PM me
		 
			
			Ian Brown is playing at Abart in Zurich on the 18th January. Tickets are now available.   
Should be a great gig if he manages to keep out of trouble with the dibble between now and then.
		 
			
			I just hope that he doesn't get bottled like  the last time he played Rohstofflager.   
Ian went offstage for a break, the roadies were switching out the Fender guitars and bringing the Gretsches onstage. This suggests the likelihood of an encore filled with Stone Roses songs. He wasn't offstage for more than 3 minutes and the idiots behind started throwing filled cups of beer towards the stage, coating us in the front row and the instruments on stage. They were asked to stop, but the continued. The lights came on the, the roadies got all the gear off stage and the Ian didn't come back on to play an encore that would have included a bunch of Roses tracks   , (as indicated on the setlist i collected)   
I really hope the Abart crowd are a bit more sensible.               is playing at the Salzhaus in Winterthur on Sunday, 22 Nov 2009   
And me sadly up in Germany...
		 
			
			The Living End - Aussie pub rock   
Monday 23 Nov Abart Zurich.   
Any interest?             
			
			Scout Niblett's at Abart on at Exil on December 3rd.   
Dinosaur Egg!
		    will be there with the missus and some mates   
went to high school with these guys       At Abart or Exil?   Put the gin bottle down, man.
		    Naughty Hendricks!   
It'sh Exil . . .       
			
			for those going to Temper Trap on the 2nd Dec - the venue has been changed to the Abart
		 
			
			Living End - what a gig man!!!    
AWESOME !!
		    YEA - it was an amazing show!!! And I liked how the venue was really stretched to it's limit, with a crowd surfer almost kicking down a ceiling-mounted stage light and with the bass literally lifting the roof      
best CHF36 I ever spent in Switzerland    
			
			A great venue for a great Band:   
Stereophonics.  
09.02.2010.  
Palais Xtra. ZH
		 
			
			The Temper Trap is playing at Abart Zurich on 2nd. December. 
Is anyone going as well?
		 
			
			Wow just listened to some Youtube vids (Science of Fear, Sweet Disposition and Fader) and they are pretty damn awesome, in fact very awesome, I really like the sound.   
Abart is 50m from my apartment too. Very tempted, will talk to my friend and look at tickets tommorrow. Thanks for the heads-up man.    
			
			You're welcome. Love Abart as it's a smaller venue AND it has a Bar    
			
			got the tickets as soon as i saw they are in CH. really looking forward to seeing them..
		 
			
			Also already secured my tickets for Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten on 22. February. He's amazing live and it will sell-out really fast. Just to give everyone the head's up.      Same here. Should be rad.    
And yep Xaiver Rudd is a go-a in December. Will bet tickets asap
		 
			
			I'll be there at Temper trap - looking forward to it - shame they changed the venue though
		    Thanks for the heads up...I would've turned up at hafenkneipe blissfully unaware that they had changed the venue otherwise. Oh well, bang goes my 3 minute walk...   
Should be an awesome gig though, can't wait to see them live.
		    ...and bang it goes to Richdog. Abarte is at the end of my street.    
Really looking forward to the gig, booking tickets tommorrow.       But Xavier Rudd is in February next year not December?
		 
			
			oops my bad. May miss it cause i'll be in Australia either feb or march
		 
			
			Biffy Clyro is playing at Mascotte in Zurich this Saturday. 
Also for those who have missed it, Editors are playing at X-tra in Zurich with support by the Maccabees! Should be a great gig.
		    Its annoying that one,we are booked for the editors,but would have really liked to see Biffy Clyro.
		 
			
			Same here. Difficult choices      me too - they supported Muse but really we were so far away and as usual the sound is rubbish in Hallenstadion and especially for the support acts. Would have been good to see them in a smaller venue   
see you Sat Mrs O
		 
			
			see you in the bar.
		 
			
			Just seen Filastine is playing at exil in Zurich tomorrow (Friday).  Think that might be mighty interesting.
		     
4th February   at abart   
10th March   at rohstofflager
		    She must have liked it here last time!
		 
			
			David Grey for anyone interested

		    Cool i might be keen for that
		 
			
			Gentleman & the Evolution are playing at Maag Event Hall in Zurich on 20th April 2010. Bit far off but tickets will sell fast.    
Gentleman is pretty amazing live!
		 
			
			John Butler Trio coming April 25th 2010 at Maag MusicHall AG  
unfortunately i'll be on a plane to Oz then    
Venue phone: 044 444 26 26.

			Jase you just made my day!   
I love John Butler Trio, saw them live at Gurten Festival.  
Will get my tickets asap     
Another heads up:   
RJD2 is playing in Bern in May.       
			
			12 March, Zurich, Volkshaus -    bringing his upcoming   work.   
Brothers and sisters in true music, this gig is a keeper of keepers.  I have heard some tasters from the CD, read reviews from in the know people who I trust with their musical opinions, and it promises to be a deep human  , esp. in these obtuse times on the planet earth.  And believe me I have seen Pat Metheny many times (more than any other artist perhaps including Joe Zawinul in the same company) since 1978, so this is full-hearted endorsement.   
If you saw   tour of 1992, and   in 2005, then this tour has the potential to outpass these two extra dimensional gigs.  Metheny is a musician/composer/human being for our times and for all times.   
Here's a neat interview with Metheny       Is RJD2 playing his low tech hip hop stuff (ie. since we last spoke/Dead ringer) or his indie singer-songwriter stuff? cause im not so found of his new direction.   
Edit: Also keen to check out DJ Vadim on Feb 5th if anyones going
		 
			
			Jose james, Kaufleuten Zurich 10th March.

Blood Red Shoes have a new album in March and they are coming to Abart on 29th March.    
			
			Dans le sac vs Scroobius pip play at Sudpol, Luzern 28th Jan.       
For those of you who haven't heard of them before, well worth a listen.    
There are also sections of spoken word from ""Scroobius pip""        
tickets are only 30.00   
Should be a great show
		    They played at Hafenkneipe in Zürich last year.  They must like it here.

I would like to meet people going to the concert?   
Cheers
		 
			
			Thanks for the James Blood Ulmer tip nice!   
I have tickets for the great Element Of Crime next week but i heard its sold out.
		 
			
			Hey people   
sorry for the last minute question, but is anyone going to the concert of Angélique Kidjo in Kaufleuten on Saturday? I'll be there with 2 friends and thought it would be a good ocassion to meet some of you     =   
All the best

Although it's on a Monday  , I'll definitely see her       will be in Zurich (Kaufleuten) on Tuesday, the  !   
Would love to see her... too bad that it's so far and on a Tuesday       will take place from the 7th to the 10th of April in Crans Montana (Valais).   
The program is available here:       
I've never been so far but I might go there on the Friday evening.   and   should be interesting.       I love air but not sure how much tickets are. I thought theyd be expensive because they're crazy popular in Australia
		 
			
			Btw: Does anyone know where I can get tickets to the Stall6 gigs? Im trying to find DJ Vadim tickets online but it seems to be the biggest run around
		    I think you can just email   to reserve tickets . . .
		 
			
			cheers mate
		 
			
			The Blood Arm are playing in Albani Club, Winterthur on 23rd Feb and Bar 59, Luzern 24th. I have seen this band twice in London, and they put on the most entertaining shows of any band I have ever seen.    
Go see them!   
(And if anybody is going to be driving to either one from the Grindelwald area, please let me know...)       Great!!! I'll be there...  Tickets available at:    
(40chf  )
		    Bar 59 is a cool little spot, might go check them out.     
La Roux is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, on the 7th March.
		    Damn, apparently it's sold out.  Anyone want rid of their tickets?
		    Do Kaufleuten normally have additional tickets on the door?
		    Don't know, but would like to find out.
		 
			
			More gigs I would like to go to (but need to work out if I can get back from Zurich on a school night  ):   
Hockey 16 Feb 10 Abart     
Vampire Weekend, May 28 2008   Zurich <-- so errr ignore that, as it's way out of date (Thanks bananahead for spotting!)
		     
Hey Kirsty, you do realise that it is 2010 this year?                 
But they were good    
			
			hmm thanks for pointing out my stupidity... but I would have liked to go! This was my vain search for bands I really like playing in Switzerland, and I turned up... 2   And one of those was 2 years ago! (It said past performances in teeny tiny writing - you can't blame me for getting over excited and missing that!)   
Harumph, so just hockey then...
		     
Hi there, 
You can buy them in Ticket corner,  they are 60.60 CHF general entrance, 
it is not that expensive. 
Are you going? 
Alex
		    The missus might be sorting tickets atm. Will let you know if we are
		    Hockey is ausverkauf.   
I'm not sure if they will have tickets on the door at Abart.

			Kitsuné faves Two Door Cinema Club are playing on January 27th at Ziegel au Lac.       
			
			Coming 27 Jan to the D! Club,   - the one and the only   for a  !!!!  Can not make it for professional commitments in other parts of the continent, but it promises to be da BOMBE.  Such a precocious talent.  A voice and presence        
Check out this clip from 1995 in London.  Whatever you do please stay in your seat...........!!!!!!!!!!       
			
			infected mushroom are playing feb 13 @      
they always seem to be changing style, better than being stagnant I guess, and I'll probably go check it out
		     
I thought he went by the name of Senanda Maitreye these days?   
P.S to save others searching the D Club location as I just did   it's in Lausanne
		 
			
			As a heads up, we actually have a concerts calendar as an option on the main forum calendar. It's somewhat lost because one has to scroll down and change the options to see it - we're working on simplifying this - but  anyway. As these lists get longer and longer, perhaps it'd be useful for others to know from the calendar if you're intending to go. It'll allow a bit of buzz for the event and let others know who's attending.
		     
Nicky, he sure has but thought to put his former name out to those who remember him from 1987 when he came out with  rby album, and several others after until he changed his name to Sananda Maitreya in 2001.   
My bad, I put Lausanne in the Title block but not in the main text!   
Anybody been to the D! Club in, of course, Lausanne?   
			
			Terrence Trent Darby used to be on my wall as a teenager, would love to see him if he did his hold stuff, alas Lausanne a bit too far..
		 
			
			I think I might go to this.    
Will just have to stay up all night and get the first train home  .
		 
			
			Nicky n Natasha   
I think he will play some of the older charts and newer ones too.   
Maybe he is on tour and coming to your area?  I had no idea about this Lausanne gig until I read it in   this Saturday morning.   
Or if you would like a very nice youth hostel near the lake in Lausanne here it is.  Highly recommended and very reasonably priced.  Think 39 chf room with breakfast       
			
			Recently discovered  covering concerts in Switzerland (landlockedblues). May be of interest to see who's around and get the er, skinny. (Is that right? Skinny? Is that still in?)

			Tindersticks are playing Kaufleuten, Zurich on May 5th.   
Miserable feckers. Great live.

It starts at 22.00       
			
			The White Lies gig for tonight has been cancelled.   
""Dearest fans. Charles from White Lies here. Im am so so sorry to say that we have to cancel tomorrows show in Munich and the following day in Zurich because Harry has picked up a very nasty viral infection which has destroyed his voice. He's seen doctors from various parts of Europe over the last few days and overdosed on every steroid/anti-inflamatory and pain-killer we could get hold of. But it hasn't worked and today we had to come off stage in Vienna after only 3 songs. We're so sad to have to re-schedule these two shows once again. We had been looking forward to them since December. Please be assured that we will still play these shows for you as soon as we finish the next album and by then have exclusive new songs for you. Love from us all. C W/L""

			Damn, sometime I miss living in Zurich...Les Claypool at the Abart club on 10 March.        
			
			Pink Martini a the Kaufleuten 15th July     
			
			and Cat Empire at Schutzenhaus Uetliberg, Zürich           
I guess the title of his tour (""Ladies make some noise"") tells it all    
			
			An hip hop event during Easter in Zurich. It will be the fisrt edition.   
Method Man, The Beatnuts, De la Soul, IAM, Diam's, Hocus Pocus and more performing between the 2nd of April and the 4th of April.             
Imogen Heap is playing tommorow night at Abart, I think tickets are still available.   
			
			I almost bought tickets for      =   
but I'm not sure.    
Opinion anyone?
		 
			
			Posting on behalf of a friend of mine, he organises Stoner rock bands to come over here.  Rock isn't normally my thing but I've hugely enjoyed every concert he put on.   
Locations are either Sedel or the Blues Bar, both in Luzern.  Sedel is the old womens prison, just outside of town, Blues Bar is a tiny room at the back of a latin nightclub, just past schuur.               
			
			Ash are playing Abart on 25th May     
Last time I went to see them was at the University of London Union...seem to remember the night ended up with me drinking Snakebite and Blacks, whilst arm wrestling students...not quite had a similar experience in Switzerland so far...
		 
			
			The Strokes, Stone Temple Pilots, Billy Talent, LCD Soundsystem, NOFX, Wolfmother, 30 Seconds to Mars, White Lies, Kasabian:   
24-27 June, St Gallen.   
Gonna be a rough weekend!
		    Yeah . . . especially without any decent bands        
*GROAN*   
sorry DJ Bobo wasn't available, he's kinda hard to get a hold of this time of the year
		    Well, I'd probably give LCD Soundsystem the time of day . . .   
And I note that The Strokes have a new album out in 2010.   
Not the freshest line up though, is it?
		 
			
			Yeah, I'm really going for the Strokes and STP (and I have a gulity pleasure for Billy Talent too, but I'm in therapy for it).   
The rest will just be cool filler, perhaps some surprises.
		 
			
			Huge Euro festivals suck. Small festivals suck harder. It's all a big con to get us to consume more product. Bring back touring.
		    What you want is small 'conference' festivals in towns:  SXSW, Stag and Dagger, The Great Escape
		    What I want is a seven foot blond chick with natural curves and green eyes who'll turn into a pizza at 3am, but I appreciate your sentiment.
		    Certain to be available at all the above events, if you do them right.
		    Ahhh I saw Ash at the Astoria last year. It was great. I will try and get along to this one. It's a school night though    
Happy memories of ULU... They used to do the best nachos to go with your snakebite!
		 
			
			I've seen Ash 3 or 4 times at various stages of their career and they have yet to be less than awesome   Best time was in a little venue in Hastings and Silver Sun were the support.   
Ah, Silver Sun - their debut album was fantastic!!
		 
			
			Saxon - Z7 - Thursdsay night.
		 
			
			Blood Red Shoes at Abart on March 29th          Indeed           
Looking forward to it lots.
		    please tell your friend to send some of these bands to lausanne...      concert cancelled !!!
		 
			
			The Moon and Stars' festival (in Locarno) programme is available:       
Too bad that Locarno is that far!!!   
I hope that JK will give another concert elswhere in Switzerland       Would go to see LCD, STP and Wolfmo but the FREAKIN World Cup is on, priorities priorities.    
I see the Gurten has Faith No More headlining - enough said. Wont be going to see that rubbish again.
		    They'll be showing all the matches from big screens so it won't be that you'll have to miss anything....btw Mike Patton is GOD!
		    To be honest its the WorldCup, I need to be comfortable when Im watching the Greatest Show on Earth!   
Hmmm MP is a deity huh... The Real Thing is their seminal album granted, in fact I still regularly listen to it, but their material got progressively Pattonised (weird and experimental in want of actual music) culminating in the God awful Mr Bungle. Discuss...
		     
I don't know how I can discuss such ignorance politely    
Different strokes I suppose and if you prefer the Mike Patton that sings Lionel Richie covers then so be it... I guess I couldn't interest you in his work with John Zorn then       No need to be polite, we are discussing Patton after all. Angel Dust was after The Real Thing, and about the time I started to loose interest. Jizzlobber was the last straw. Terrible.
		 
			
			I for one am stoked to see FNM headlining the Gurten Festival!!!    
btw...   
epic < angel dust < king for a day < album  of the year   
tomahawk is also awesome.   
peeping tom is really good too.    
mr bungle and fantomas are acquired tastes but absolutely incredible live.
		     
what's a world cup?         
Sorry, not my thing
		    Unfortunately this world cup is not played with sticks so guess your national team didnt qualify, u could always support the USA       He does a great job, I'll post them up in events shortly, but if you'e a big fan of any of the bands, it'd worth the trip to Luzern.  Both venues are very small and you get right up close to the band.
		 
			
			Soccer world cup? I know what id rather do..... Anything. But then again I'll watch anything when im loaded   
Anyone going to this M4 music thingo tomorrow? Keen to see Jose Gonzalez again. Last time I saw him the sound was awful and it was a horrible setup
		    Jeff Beck!
		    yeah but in support of ZZ Top? ewww....      
but i will say tho that Jeff Beck was amazing at Montreux Jazz Festival a couple years ago. probably my favorite guitarist evah!    
			
			FYI Paleo Festival has announced their lineup....meh           
besides Iggy & the Stooges & Indochine... meh indeed
		    Two Door Cinema Club and We Have Band are worth seeing.   
Foals are very definitely worth seeing . . . amazing live performers.  Klaxons too.   
I'll happily dance to Vitalic and Yuksek.   
N*E*R*D pretty good live too.
		    So I can see what snazzy dressers they are? Sorry, generic ""indie"" music bores me nowadays. Good point about N.E.R.D. & Vitalic though.
		    There's a big difference between TDCC and something like Coldplay or the Kooks.  There's electronica and afro-pop in there.  Yes, they're snappy dressers, but that's part of the deal if you sign to Kitsuné.  Not sure how they'd come across on a festival stage though.
		     
Which they stole from Vampire Weekend, who stole it from Paul Simon, who stole it from Fela Kuti. Shame he's dead now...
		    . . .  who stole it from someone else in Africa . . . etc etc blah blah blah   
You think there's a chance of completely ahistoric music with no antecedents?  And that bands shouldn't use some of the same sounds and influences?  TTCM fall some way in between Vampire Weekend and Foals, but have their own sound.  Vampire Weekend are more preppy/New England.  Foals miss out the Afro-pop, but have some of the same kind of indie-dance and free range guitar.
		    meh indeed
		   26.05.2010: Foals @ Abart, Zurich  
Tickets are available from    
			
			Port O'Brien playing in Zurich, Basel and Luzern this weekend. I have seen them in Dublin before and they were great live! Recommend.   
Hopefully they will still make it despite volcano issues!
		 
			
			Stevie Wonder at Moon and Stars on 7th July.
		 
			
			Crystal Castles at rohstofflager, Zürich on the 27th April, might try and make that.
		    play the Idaplatzfest in Zurich, 21st August, showcasing their second album      Perhaps      playing this Friday night at 8pm at Kaufleuten Zurich.
		 
			
			Not sure if it's already pegged in here, but The Eels are playing in Winterthur on August 28th, supported by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  Tix are 54 CHF from Starticket.   
Also the night before, Paolo Nutini is playing the same spot.   
Looks like an open air music week in old town Winterthur, should be cool. (Events already created for both in the Concerts calendar)
		 
			
			I've created a social event in the calendar for the Tunng gig on Wednesday.
		 
			
			this looks promising:        
at least for friday night.       What is it about the Swiss and Skunk Ananse?? 
Every other country got tired of them in weeks!   
The Eels looks promising!
		     
When you figure that out please explain to me their fascination with Amy Macdonald.   
It's just Eels btw, no ""the""
		     Cool, miss living there.
		    Anyone fancy it, or already going?
		    Er . . . that was last night wasn't it?
		    May, no?   
(too short)
		    Ooops . . .  I am living in the future!     (Yes . . . there are flying cars here and everything)   
			
			This looks good, an open-air festival for Zurich at long last.  i'll be there for Underworld and Booka Shade.  I'll try for Placebo but tradition dictates I turn up right at the end of their encore...          I've posted an event for this:       
			
			Bump for the Tindersticks playing at Kaufleuten tonight. Anyone else in?
		 
			
			Jimi Tenor and Tony Allen at the Kaserne tonight (8/5/10). Tony Allen was the band leader for Fela Kuti, but his solo stuff since then is less of the traditional afrobeat. Fans of experimental rock and jazz should check it out!
		 
			
			They obviously like it here     
mo. 29.11. -  - abart
		   Mike Patton's Mondo Cane   Thursday , 29.07.2010   20h00  Luzern (CH)  KKL Luzern - Konzertsaal    
			
			A.R Rahman concert 
Hallenstadion Zurich 
16 July        thanks for posting. that would be a VERY interesting show to see.    
but it seems like most concert announcements just make me realize i'm on the wrong side of switzerland.       Foals were amazing last night.  Tracks from the second album are generally more contemplative than those from the first and therefore less appropriate for a live performance.  The old/new split was about 70/30.  It's just incredible the way the band plays together . . . precise but intensely passionate.  Many times throughout the gig I just went 'wow'.  The final song, 'One Step, Two Step' left the crowd on a high.
		 
			
			not sure if anyone has posted it yet, but Slash is touring his new album in June. He's playing X-tra on the 16th of June. Miles Kennedy is on vocal duties.   
from what i've read they are playing a healthy mix of tracks from Slashs' back catalogue and the new stuff.  i'm really looking forward to this one.           
			
			Another overlooked festival, just saw a poster for it...Neuchatel Open Air.   
Cypress Hill! Looks like a nice location too.        
			
			What about the   in Lucerne   
Shame about the name.... I think its for the sexually frustrated
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this but....      - Abart, Monday 5th July, CHF35   
Fo sho!
		    Oh how gutted i was to hear this was on the 5th July, the day i go on holiday! VERY gutted
		    damn have my mother here from Oz that week. Might take her with us    
			
			Almost missed this one, John Garcia plays Kyuss at Schuur tonight (2nd June), Luzern.
		 
			
			i'm going to see them tomorrow in lausanne. i didn't bother posting coz i really didn't think there was anyone here interested.   
should i also mention baroness is playing in fribourg in july? my new favorite band.    
			
			A band I know will be playing Thu, June 10 in Stall 6. 
African Percussions and a singer from Gambia. 
P-Train & Lamine Jobarteh.   
CHF 10.-            
			
			The Kissaway Trail the highlight (for me) of this year's For Noise festival in Pully (near Lausanne).       
			
			I'm surprised no one has mentioned Prince in Geneva on 12 July.        
			
			Not sure if this has already been mentioned   
29th Sept Hallenstadion    
I am so there!   
Tickets for ticket corner members went on sale today, general public tomorrow I think, many pre sales tickets already sold out so get up early tomorrow folks    
			
			Say what now? I thought I knew you! interwebz-wise.       stick with me Debz and i'll show you the way    
come on who can not be a Peter Gabriel fan?
		             
anyone born after 1980       Phil Collins fans?
		 
			
			anyone coming to Bsides festival today?
		 
			
			Possibly, keeping an eye on the weather.
		    Damn . . . didn't spot that.  Not sure if I can come now.   
Three Trapped Tigers are excellent.
		 
			
			Hmmmm . . . Crystal Fighters are playing at the Imagine Festival in Basel tomorrow.       
Am I right in thinking this is free?   
Anyone else going?
		     
it is free, might be going.
		 
			
			I've already booked and paid for my Guns n Roses tickets.   
Geneva, 16th September at the Arena (beside the Airport)
		 
			
			I'm probably a bit slow off the mark, but Mumford and Sons are playing (with Sophie Hunger) the Montreux JF on 14th July. Tickets are note available on the ticketcorner site but, unlike other, it is not marked as sold out on the Montreux site.   
I'm also very tempted by Julian Casablancas with Vampire Weekend but at 80.- it's a bit steep. There are tickets available for that though.   
Does anyone know where else I might be able to get tickets? I can get to Montreux to buy them next week if this is necessary...   
Merci d'avance!
		 
			
			More rock at Sedel, Luzern.   
July 2nd 
Yawning Man   
July 4th 
Mondo Generator   
July 8th 
Valient Thorr
		 
			
			Devendra Banhart is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, Tuesday July 13th. Tickets from        
			
			Its not a Swiss gig so please don't shoot me down but we are off Wed to Belgium to what I reckon is the BEST open air festival in the world.....   
Werchter Festival is so damn well organised and has a solid line up every year. Just 8 hours drive. You can't beat it peoples.   
ROCKONAUSTRALIA !!!        decent festival but Primavera destroys all
		 
			
			careful with your ears, folks.    
my last concert, john garcia plays kyuss, might be my last concert.    
since then, i have tinnitus. BAD. this sucks.    
i will post up some tinnitus info at some point but please take care of your ears.   
/sweet blog
		    Nice!  I may have to think about this... haven't had my fill of weird yet this year.    One of my all-time favorites:   
[maybe this should be in song of the day...]   
But on a Tuesday?!? Come on!   
EDIT: Anyone here planning to go?  I am so up for it but pretty sure my roomie wouldn't be interested...
		 
			
			Baby was a black sheep, baby was a whore. Baby got big but she's gonna get bigger..... Anyone going to see Patti Smith in the Rote Fabrik on Wednesday? 
I really hope she only plays old songs, but it's not too far to walk home if she does.
		 
			
			here's an 'under-the-radar' festival...in grandson VD...          Oh man, missed that and probably can't go now.   
Love this song:       
			
			It'll be outside, on the lakeside, so you could in theory, come watch the football, outside, and listen to her in the background. It's going to be quite a night! I'll be up on the roof!        I really should be but the devil on my left shoulder told me to go watch football instead.
		 
			
			Rodney Branigan at the Cava.....     
			
			anyone interested in Baroness at Bad Bonn (Düdingen), 13 July? I got some super dooper expensive earplugs to try out.        
			
			Patti was legendary. The lake was magnificent, and Germany lost. Was that the perfect night?        crap i just saw this! i love patti smith- seen her a ton of times and poetry stuff too... wish i knew i'd have definitely gone...   
i've even got a gorgeous photo of her holding my then 6month old son at a poetry event in nyc... wah. a bit sad now i need to keep up on these things...   
			
			I want to be half that cool when I'm 62!       I would have loved to have gone , but I got the feeling that you would have got the weird Patti doing performance art versions of stuff, rather than the angry Horses version ... 
If it was the later then I wish I had gone !
		    was incredible.                
			
			T'was the latter. I expected a post-menapausal, I know it all and I'm gonna pass on the word Patti, but she rocked! Right up til her final song, which was rock and roll nigga. Having said that, she didn't actually do horses.     
			
			The Coral are playing Abart on November 2nd   
Should be a really good gig and tickets are only 35CHF       
			
			Mike Patton fans- Mondo Cane will be in Lucerne the 29th at the  .

          30.11.             (usa) &    (uk)   
sif you would go to Helmet. ffs its HELMET!!!!
		     
almost word for word what a friend said to me when he saw that    
Xiu Xiu in St Gallen in November..
		 
			
			ooh, i'd like to see those Drums in action.  (is the day before my birthday too, sounds like a good excuse for a big friday night)   
i'd be interested in seeing kate nash covered in whipped cream and lip-synching too, but only for laughs             A very good excuse indeed! It would be nice to see you there ... I've got my ticket ...      Yep, I agree, only for laughs, but as I do not like the location, I most probably skip that one.
		 
			
			i have just been informed that the Scissor Sisters are playing the on the 15th of November.          HELL YEAH!    
but that's a looong drive for a tuesday night.      
holy crap! after a quick search they are playing in Yverdon on Dec 1st. STOKED!
		    hope they are better than when they were at hallenstadion, worst gig in my history of gigs and i only had to endure half of it
		    I'll buy ya a beer, so take the train    
			
			02.12.2010 gossip @ x-tra, zurich 
info:   (german)
		 
			
			I see Booker T is playing  tomorrow (21st July). Rather peeved to only spot this now, plus to have to miss it due to soccerball.
		    wish i could. you're very lucky to have the abart. when i lived in zurich, i only saw 3 concerts there (in 3 years) due to working so much and just being out of the loop. recently i went and looked at the history of who has been there since i left in 2001 and thought i was gonna be sick.    
king's x at the abart was one of my favoritist shows ever.    
			
			Here's a few gigs that might be of interest in the ""near"" future:   
Pendulum 30/09 Xtra CHF45   
Goldfrapp 05/10 Xtra CHF60   
The Coral 02/11 Abart CH37

			Pendulum, oh boy, might have to get in early on that one..
		 
			
			Kap Bambino at X-Tra in Zürich this Friday!       
(not sure that's the best of venues though)
		 
			
			It's notable how many bands return to Zürich soon after playing here.  Dan mentioned Blood Red Shoes above, Beach House too.  Do they think it's cool here or is it the strong CHF?   
Here's another returner . . . Au Revoir Simone at Abart on August 23rd, they were good at Stall 6 last September.   
Other acts that may or not be returning:   
Mystery Jets at Abart on 11th October

Eintritt Frei!
		    Paging Gastro Gnome...that thoroughly nice chap is playing for free    
Sadly I'll be somewhere else...   
Oh, and I assume you mean September instead of October       Funnily enough I've met Gilles a couple of times through a friend.  She was visiting London from Estonia and was a big fan of worldwide.  She went to his club and got chatting to him.  He invited her to his house the next day and sent her off with a load of vinyl . . . she went back to Tallinn and became a DJ.  Nice chap.   
Have I already told you that story before?
		     
nice lil' story which doesn't amaze me all that much. Peterson seems like such a nice bloke at least on the radio show    
I might make the drive out ... Zükunft is such a great little club with an awesome vibe and the woodblock prints for announcing the nights
		    I'm not sure you got to the vinyl bit as those pesky Foals were a playing there thingys awfully loud    
*worldwide worldwide worldwide*
		    Ah yes . . . it's all coming back to me . . .
		 
			
			Is anybody heading to Rote Fabrik on Saturday to see The Maccabees?   
It's free from what i can understand of this-        
I might be if I can get out of prior arrangements
		 
			
			Pink Floyd fans should be headed to Dietikon, ZH Saturday evening 9-18-10:          Brilliant!  Yeah . . . I'd like to go and see them.

support is the fantastic Sheila She Loves You from Basel
		 
			
			I can't believe I just read about Maccabees now it now. 
They are pretty cool!
		    It was an excellent gig, more so for being free.  We should lobby them to return.
		 
			
			The brilliant band The Wedding Present are playing on the 31 october in the Mariaberg in Rorschach:     
...why Rorschach       And they're playing Bizarro!?!?!?!?!   
Hmmm . . . might have to look at a hotel there . . .
		    Yes might be an option.    
Not doable on public transport as the last train departing towards Zurich leaves at 22.40.   
Why don't they play at the Volkshaus in Zurich like normal bands do?  
Don't get their marketing strategy?!   But then if they ever had a marketing strategy they'd be a world famous band by now.
		    Their biggest marketing push, as far as I remember, was quite perverse and involved releasing a seven inch single for every month of 1992.  I had 'em all, but have somehow lost track of them.       too much apple pie, Tubbs           
I just checked them out - thanks for the tip - I love them!!  Shame they don't have more dates up on their calendar but I will keep an eye out.  Hope there are more bands like them around - gives me hope    
			
			Nothing beats   for finding out what's on. 
You filter by date, price, distance willing to travel, can link to other social sites etc..
		    How do I see everything in Zürich.   
It just came back with this limited selection:        Hmmm . . . I tried registering.   
Does it only show you bands you track?      I've just spent ten minutes getting nothing but frustrated with that site.  I simply want to see what's on in Zürich.  Instead it seems I have to track a load of bands.  Can't I just track Zürich?
		    Don't know if you meant Sheila she loves you or the morning benders but if it was the first they are playing in La Catrina in Zürich tmw evening for   good idea to get there a bit early though as it fills up quickly.
		    They usually play at least 3 times a year in Switz anyhow..
		    Who told you that? The Wedding Present have hardly ever played 3 times a year in Switzerland (if ever).
		    Yes - Shelia she loves you - I won't be in Switzerland until the 11th October but will checking out all the bands and venues.  Do the gigs usually finish in time to catch the last train back from Zurich to Basel?  Here in scotland there are some venues that run 7 to 10 pm and last train is about 11pm but most venues run to midnight or later.
		    Well if you're moving to Basel I'm sure you'll have plenty of chances to see them. Most venues try to finish in time for the last train but it doesn't always work out.
		    Perhaps slightly exaggerated but they do come through quite often. I know for sure they've played Sommercasino in Basel several times.
		     
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finntroll @ Konzertfabrik Z7 - Dec 12!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't know that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank the holy lord that I was browsing this thread!!!!! One of my current favorite Bands of all time... Slightly strange coincidence too.   
So um, anybody else going?    
			
			Black Rebel Motorcycle Club @ Zurich Volkshaus November 14th   
Can find it listed everywhere but can't find tickets yet...
		   , Luzern on the 15th of October, unfortunately I'll miss it as I'm DJ at Bar 59 the same night.

Shellac is playing in Bern on the same day , a bit torn between the two.If he would be singing bad seeds songs it would be easier.
		 
			
			Tell me about it! I'm immersing myself in Grinderman, to get used to it so I won't be too confused on the day. Having said that, they may do a couple of their badseed songs.       
			
			Dollhouse (SWE) play mascotte today (tuesday)- starts around 20h and some norwegian band will open for them.

Fribourg   
Bandsintown.com is pretty cool but has some limitations. I'd like to be able to opt out specific locations (like Zurich and anything in France) and it would be cool if you could feed it a list of bands from your music collection. Aside from that a nice utility. A friend told me about something similar that works with your itunes collections, feeds your band names into a database and returns upcoming concerts for bands in your collection plus similar bands.
		    How was the show?      Thank you!   
27th October @            
			
			Not sure if its been mentioned but a band from my home town in Australia are playing on Nov 5. Really Psychedelic but pretty decent the only time ive seen them    
Tame Impala 
Nov 5 @ Mascotte, Zurich
		 
			
			Club night rather than gig: Nu:Tone (Hospital Records)* & Stamina MC are playing at Kaserne, Basel on Sat 23rd Oct:    
Will be heading over from Zurich, anyone else going?   
* UK Drum and Bass producer and DJ
		 
			
			A bit disapointing to be honest. Maybe it was just too early in the tour. Some of it worked, some of it was a disaster. Nick was looking alot like Bunny Munroe.        Hmm. I saw him in Liverpool once; someone shouted ""C'mon Phil Collins"" and he never recovered. To think he let Kylie slip from his arms...
		 
			
			I don't want to talk about         I've met stamina at a house party once. Hes a cool dude. I could make it out for this one. I love hospital artists
		 
			
			Anyone going to see Santana tonight? My old man (who is a good laugh) is going by himself and he probaly wouldn't mind meeting up with some fellow old skool fans.       Anyone going to the Deftones show in Fribourg?  Has anyone been to that venu; is it large, small etc?  Thanks!
		    depending on which hall they use it can hold anywhere from 300 to about 3000 people. Considering it's the Deftones I'd imagine it would be the larger one. Frison is one of the best concert venues in Switz imo. One drawback to it though is that if you're in Basel or ZH it's often difficult to get back home with the train if you wanna stay till the end of the concert.
		    i'm going!    
i saw mastodon there last spring and i enjoyed it but have to say the acoustics there are pretty bad. there are certain spots where the reverberations from the big walls will turn the music into a horrible constant roar. a few feet to the left or right and it's ok again. also, there are no elevated viewing areas (all just a big floor) so if you are on the short side it might not be ideal. otherwise, i like the old warehouse style of venue.
		    Hmm, well i'd be comming from Basel so i guess i should start to look for someone with a car (if anyone is going anway?) or try and find a place to stay.  I wish there were better concert venues in Basel!  Thanks for the info!
		     
a friend of mine might be going with a car. Ask me when the time comes.
		    Cool, I'll prob catch the train over in the eve, let me know if you want to meet up.
		 
			
			Saw sharon jones and the dap kings last night @ kaufleuten and they were amazing. Invited two of my mates and they also raved about the show.   
First time ive been to kaufleuten too. Really cool venue. Might be a little posh for me though    
			
			Anyone going to see   on Friday?  Let me know, I'm going with another lady friend by train from Zurich hb.
		 
			
			The excellent Bonobo is playing a few dates in Switzerland

		    Ooh! Ooh!  I would totally join for Seu Jorge! But I'll be out of town.  
Ah well, next time. 
Let me know how the show is; never seen him live and most of the albums I love of his are *quite* a few years old.
		    Check out his  stuff!  
If you haven't already seen the LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU you must.
		    Balls. Im back home for Xmas. Bonobo is dooooooope
		 
			
			is there anyone interested in two free tickets to KARMA TO BURN playing in Martigny on Nov 3rd? i can't go now due to other plans. i hate to see good tickets go to waste...PM me if interested.
		     
Decent band and nice guys. I would take those tickets off you if only 1) I knew where Martigny was, and 2) David Max and the Sons of Void weren't playing in Basel and Spectrum weren't playing in Basel on the same night.
		 
			
			i was all set to drive an hour to martigny to see them, bought 2 tickets for me and a friend, then later discovered that i had mistaken the date and have another concert (public enemy) on the same night. then to top it off, they booked another show in yverdon on the next night, which is even closer than martigny. i'm planning to go to that one.        
Thank you so much for your post!   
I am definitely going to Seu Jorge's concert! 
Is anyone from Basel joining too?!
		 
			
			Moorcheeba with Skye (26th) in Zurich

Sweet    
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned   as a gig guide/general stuff to do resource...just happened to see a copy of it on the tram this morning and it's a pretty comprehensive       Indeed.  I'm not sure if it's entirely comprehensive though.   
The @zueritipp Twitter feed is laughable.
		 
			
			ooooooH!!!!

			Went there for the first time last night to see Caribou and Shy Child - what a fantastic dive it is ! I miss the toilet venues in London (Dublin Castle, Windmill, Notting Hill Arts Club and so on) and this place would not look out of place if it was in a side street off Oxford Street.   
Recommended if you like down and dirty venues and interesting up and coming bands.   
Shy Child totally kicked bottom. I enjoyed Caribou but after half an hour felt I had enjoyed them sufficiently.   
Coming up - Beach House, The Swans, A Place To Bury Strangers and in January The Fall   
Pay on the door, no advance booking, no credit cards. Like stepping back to the seventies but in a GOOD way.           
Ive been hearing her songs in the local Migros a lot actually. Maybe they have her album or that she's gaining a little notoriety in Switzerland?
		 
			
			of course, in response to this....  i have to offer up the original.  I was never a massive Chisel fan, before my time, but I know every word to this one.                     Only the two in Zurich...but at the Xavier Rudd on 21st and Panteon Rococo on 24th (also in abart)

		    Strangely at the same address as Dollhouse  . Could make for some interesting shows.
		    So I look on their website and pop up a post. And then the next day I get a newsletter saying that it's not Zurich but Luzern.

			If any of youse are keen on your blues, C.W. Stoneking is playing @ El Lokal, Zurich on the 27th Feb.    
His version of seven nation army on TripleJ a few years ago was a think of beauty. Id post it but its block out of Australia    
			
			Ah, I can't believe I missed Lambchop. And Mark Lanegan, that hurts. And Einsturz. And New Model Army, they are still playing? Wowsies...I should really watch this thread.
		 
			
			Also I saw K&D are playing at Volkshaus on Jan 29th. Im super double mega pumped to see this if anyone's keen for a catch up
		    just got informed that johen arbeit will not be be playing after all      UPDATE VOM 07.01.2011: Leider musste Jochen  Arbeit die Tour aus familiären Gründen absagen. Brian Mitchell wird aber  im Café Kairo eine Solo-Show spielen.      Love love love C.W. Stoneking!   He will also be playing at ISC in Bern on 17th of Feb - this has just made my day.

			<3 the Cold War Kids! Thanks for the heads up on this show!      I've been living in Boston for two years now, and will be moving to Basel in a couple of months. The Dropkick Murphys put on a great show!
		 
			
			Thanks for the heads up...I saw them in Manchester many moons ago, and unfortunately they really did come off as a two/three song band. Still might be worth a watch in a small venue like the Abart.          When will you be in Basel?  If you want to meet up and have a chat or see a show drop me a line    Always nice to meet someone comming from Boston.
		    Sounds like a good show.  I will probably join.  Anyone else going?  Is this venu easy to get to from the main station?
		    Hi JustRose,       (from the Bahnhofquai/HB tramstop)  direction Albisgütli and get off at the Sihlcity Nord stop or you can catch the S4 Train (from track 1 at the Zürich HB) and get off at the Gieshubel stop. Both stops are walking distance.       Looks like the Black Keys have cancelled    
On the plus side Mogwai will play Rote Fabrik on Friday 11th March, tickets CHF35.    
			
			Some others I have seen on Zueritipp:

			I'm definitely going to catch the Foo Fighters at Greenfield this year. The teaser for new sound songs great (well at least the first 30 seconds). Sounds more like their older stuff.     
			
			my favourite song of the foo fighters is "" my hero"", followed by ""the pretender"" and ""wheels"". 
Looking forward to the festival........
		 
			
			I can't make it to Greenfield this year as ill be away so am planning to go to Southside festival (in southern germany) instead.  Anyone been to southside in past years?  It looks like a really great lineup this year:

		    I saw 'Does it Offend you , Yeah?' in London a couple of years ago.  Quite underwhelming though.    
I'm not a huge Streets fan, but this is a must see as it will be the final tour ever.
		    I'll be there! Anyone else?

			Ever since we moved to basel in October we have been on the hunt for local unsigned indie bands in cool small venues.  So far we have been to 2 gigs - both great but we are used to 2 or 3 a week!!!  Seems the venues are here but not always our genre of music (too heavy or hip-hop etc..)  so after waiting patiently - we have 2 gigs next weekend!! And all Swiss bands!!   
Friday the 25th at Kuppel for the Choo Choo's of Bern and the Kapoolas from Basel   
Saturday the 26th for Basel's own: Shelia She Loves You and the Oh' No's (two of the bands we've already seen) at the Union Kultur Club.   
Along with seeing the Charivari on Monday night (to see the Top Secret Drummers) its gonna be a good week!!!!
		 
			
			^ Sheila She Loves You are fab - their last gig at la Catrina in ZH last year was my fave gig of the whole year. I hope they make it back to ZH sometime soon!
		 
			
			Queens of the Stone Age   
At Komplex 457   
on 11th May
		     YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!                Gimme....where?
		 
			
			In basel try out 
Nordstern 
Hirshnek 
NT areal
		    Cheers for the heads up. Just bagged me some tickets      The one venue we really liked was Sommer Casino - they do a lot of rock, metal as well as hip/hop.  Only a couple indie nights over the last few months.  Also look at the Kaserne - this is right near us and looks fab from the outside but nothing on their calendar really appeals to us.
		    I have to yet find heavy and actually interesting here, but it is not like I venture out much for this, we live in a tiny place...so gota give it real chance. The stuff I have heard was either to eager to be heavy, leaving everything else behind, or noise for the sake of noise, but I am sure there is something worth listening.
		 
			
			queens of the stone age will also be at this year's kilby at bad bonn!!!! can't wait to find out the rest of the lineup!           Just some info on tix: tickets go on sale this  , limited to 4 per person, from either        
or        
Tix are expected to sell out fast, so get in quick!
		 
			
			After lots of wondering why there had been no news, I was sad to hear today that there will be no Zurich Open Air Festival this year   - last year's line-up was so awesome.   
BUT   
it is confirmed for 2012. Yay!       
			
			Bad Kilbi Bonn's a great festival, great atmosphere and generally good bands there. I saw the legendary Sunn o))) there a couple of years ago.
		     :d
		    And they are now sold out.
		 
			
			The Sadies @ El Lokal May 29 ... Also playing the Stolze Open Air Festival Zurich on May 28th     
cheers, 
Sue
		    ahem      
Anyway. She was fantastic.   
It was my first time at Komplex. And it's tiny. I was expecting somewhere a bit bigger than abart but I think it's actually smaller. Although it does have a higher ceiling which helps with the sound.
		    Smaller than Abart?!  Mmkay, explains why QOTSA sold out so quickly.
		    I'm sad that I missed her      
The Komplex venue can be rearranged for bigger shows. The walls are all moveable - actually it's a huge space. That's why it can accommodate bigger acts like QOTSA, My Chemical Romance, Interpol etc etc as well as the smaller ones (Phoenix Foundation, Caitlin Rose) I think the capacity is up to 5000.
		 
			
			Looks like British Sea Power have cancelled their March European tour,  including the Abart gig on the 09.03.11.    
Not sure why....but Noble cracked a rib at the last gig. Bummer!   
Gigs will hopefuly be re-scheduled for later in 2011.
		    Yep, it is planned to be re-scheduled ... or at least that is the plan so far. Fingers crossed!       I used to love Belle and Sebastian until I saw them at Open Air last year, they were pretty lame.    
			
			Haha, got sucked in and forgot what I came on here originally to post    
Anyone else going to Roger Waters this summer? I am already looking forward to it!! I just can't wait haha    
			
			I am going! can't wait       I bought The Boy With The Arab Strap when it first came out on vinyl but never really got into it. Then late last year I bought the latest and love it. Since then I have bought all of the CD's so I hope I'm not disappointed but I think they will be better indoors than out. And it should have a totally different vibe to a festival.

José is a world renowned guitarist, born in Brazil but living in Nyon. He used to teach at the Geneva conservatoire, and has appeared many times at The Paleo and Montreux Jazz festivals. A brilliant artist.
		    When you think they started as a college project, they've come far from the days of playing King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow.   
I've seen them a few times and they always deliver, but can get a little twee. At one show at the Rote Fabrik they covered Dire Straits' Romeo and Juliet. Hmm. Since Isobel Campbell left, so did the darker elements. Still worth seeing though    
			
			Atari Teenage Riot are playing @ Salzhaus, Winterthur 21.05.2011:

Ohhh! ... and Beady Eye are playing at Gurten Festival. Excellent!  
(Other annoucements for Gurten: The Ting Tings, Kate Nash & Royal Republic)
		 
			
			Noise fans,  is playing tomorrow (sun March 6th, 9pm), in Geneva, at  .    
I was curious myself, saw this performer from New Zeland 3 days ago in Prague and he blew my mind. Plus, he is a really cool dude, high school prof on his sabatical touring the world with his musical mission. He is quite big in his field, so far on this tour he has played in UK, Scandinavia, CZ, FR, after CH he is going to Japan. Just a note for the gentle souls amongst us, bring ear plugs (just in case the sound guy sucks  ).    
It's short and sweet, very intense and a ton of dizzy fun. We are going.
		     
Wow...just checked out the Gurtenfestival...many bands I like! 
I think I'll go to see The Sctrip and PLan B on July 16th.

Shoegaze-y, girl-group-y pop, garage rock-y, grunge-y goodness.
		 
			
			Yes please.           that sounds really good, shame I missed it.
		 
			
			Lloyd Cole small ensemble 13th April at Restaurant Viadukt.
		    Actually, it was awesome....The Geneva performance better than in Prague, then, Cave 12 threw a gig yesterday -  and  also quite obscure noise, I am sorry I have missed those 2.    
But, were very lucky to have Campbell Kneale of  on our couch past few days, weeheee...a lot of interesting talk.    
Check out Cave12 in Geneva, it's a fantastic project, loads of gigs are in  , an experimental culture place, I think it used to be a squat, unsurprisingly. I love the venue, nice people, guests and staff. Cave12 are great, too. Very approachable, I want to gig with them, when we finally put sh...t together.

2 Day music festival in Basel - April 1st and 2nd. Figures we are in scotland that weekend for a 2 day music festival in Edinburgh but anyone else looking for live music (indie, etc...) in little venues should consider going!!   
I've been to a couple of the venues and they were great (summer casino, kaserne) and have seen The Kapoolas and really liked them.   
Oh and Shelia she loves you!!  Very good local Basel band!
		 
			
			I've got the following gigs lined up: the human league, swans and qotsa at the bad kilbi bonn festival, earth, cyndi lauper, marianne faithful, belle and sebastian but I'm most looking forward to seeing Earth

jun 24th 
3 doors down will play at jun 14th at the volkshaus zurich
		 
			
			lyle Lovett plays at kaufleuten jul 17th, good charlotte plays at komplex 457 
aug 04th
		 
			
			Flexing my urban muscle, Frauenfeld 2011:   
Snoop Dogg, Lil Wayne, Cypress Hill, Wyclef Jean, The Roots, Taio Cruz, Ice Cube, Black Star (Mos Def and Talib Kweli), M.O.P, Public Enemy....to name a few.   
Sounds like a hot ticket
		 
			
			for the same customers(frauenfeld) is the festival in wohlen (Touch the air), june 23th to 26th with timabland, akon, ludacris, busta rhymes to name a few     
			
			British band The Brew playing the Galery Music Bar near Z7 in Pratteln tomorrow night        Yes that looks a great line-up. Underworld are amazing live, and been wanting to see 2ManyDJs live for a long time. 
I'll hopefully be able to spend the whole weekend there.     
And for this weekend (Sat 2nd April): Kings Of The Jungle @ Komplex Zürich:        
			
			Another reminder for my mates awesome Rock'nRoll April events at Sedel, Luzern, stoner/pysch/desert/doom rock.   Different concerts on the 3rd, 8th, 21st(22nd is a holiday btw, so you can stay out late) and the 23rd of April, see   for details.       
Sedel is a great venue for these bands, I just wish it was a little closer to town.  Shuttle busses do run every half hour I think and only cost a tip for the driver.
		 
			
			Also, just seen   and   are playing Stall 6 in Zurich on the 2nd of April.  Loving whatever that scene is, electronic hip hop beats, monster bass and synths.  Their albums are well worth a listen if you don't mind a bit of the electronic).   
Edit : FFS, Young Gods play Sedel on the same night, and it's a friends birthday, damn.
		 
			
			The line-up for the Palèo Festival has just been announced - The National, PJ Harvey, Portishead, Beirut, The Strokes, Anna Calvi, The Chemical Brothers and more...               
			
			Filter at Abart on 22 June       there are some fine acts playing there but mainly during the week and I've got to work!    
			
			Best thing about Paleo, for me, has always been the discovery of acts I would've never seen otherwise...  &   come to mind in recent memory
		 
			
			Don't forget! Belle and Sebastian @ X-Tra ZH next Wednesday 13.04.11 Perfect indie pop - herbaceous borders, foxes, cups of tea etc etc            
Filter are phenomenal live, I saw them at a festival when Richard Patrick got nailed in the head with waterbottle. Didn't miss a beat right at the corus of 'Hey Man Nice Shot'.   
Crowd went berzerk! Sick mosh pit. I never knew 'Take a Picture' could be such a heavy song.   
Gonna hit up this show up for sure.
		 
			
			José González & The Göteborg String Theory are playing tomorrow (Friday 8th April) at Salzhaus Winterthur.       
Anyone else going as well?
		   Ben Howard is playing at the Caribana Festival in Crans-près-Céligny on 11th June:           Has anyone been to this small Festival?   
			
			Just got an e-mail with the BlueBalls Luzern lineups;

I feel like some music        
Concert is tonight. Should be really good       
			
			Dirty Dozen Brass Band from New Orleans plays at Moods tomorrow.  I'll be there.
		 
			
			Tuesday July 5th    - X-tra     
			
			I heard that next thursday Beardyman is playing @ Stall6 for around 20CHF. If you get the chance check out his essential mix from this year (or last..... can't remember...). Basically beat-box's the entire thing while looping over himself beat-boxing.    
Its like the musical form of Inception
		 
			
			Slash plays JUL 13th at the KOmplex 
Rise Against plays Aug 23rd at the xtra 
Josh Groban plays at the KKL Luzern Oct 06 th
		   , Luzern, doors open at 22:00 tonight. 4 bands, no work tomorrow.

			Architecture in Helsinki playing Kaserne in Basel on Easter Sunday night.

Already have my tickets for friday.             How was it? I wanted to go but didn't want to put up with the pain of getting back to Zürich - I had things to do on Saturday.
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this before but Raul Midon will be playing in Zurich at Moods on 10th May. Tickets available   priced at CHF38.   
This guy is brilliant        
			
			Atari Teenage Riot are playing at Salzhaus, Winterthur, 21.05.11           
Minus a member, right?
		    Yeah there's just 3 of them on tour - Alec Empire, Nic Endo, and MC CX KiDTRONiK, I think. Carl Crack OD'd in 2001.
		 
			
			Sheffield band   are playing @ Stall 6, ZH next Wednesday 18.05.11         (ps. I've got some free tix if anyone wants them, check the 'Free Stuff' section)   
			
			Holy Sh!t!   
Wilco are coming to Basel on 7th November - playing the Kaserne   
Also the Wild Beasts are playing on the river in Basel on 11th August.   
Awesome!!!
		 
			
			Cat's Eyes (Faris Badwan of The Horrors, and Canadian opera singer Rachel Zeffira) are playing at Hafenkneipe, ZH, on Thursday 26.05.11, kind of dark girl group pop with goth undertones. Watch their debut performance at the Vatican (of all places!):       
			
			anyone else going to einstürzende neubauten tomorrow and on thursday in lausanne? i'm SO looking forward to it! if i manage to get there in time that is...   
			
			A while away yet, but awesome Kiwi band   are playing at Abart, ZH, Thurs. 08 September 2011. I saw them at the m4m festival this year and they almost blew the roof off Exil.
		 
			
			Cut Copy + Architecture in Helsinki @ Stall 6, ZH, 28.06.11 - so I will get to see AiH this year after all    
			
			Grandmaster Flash at Stall 6, Zürich, Saturday May 28, 22.00
		    Getting back home was the expected long, drawn-out, sleepy saga, but it was worth it. Cinema-gig with the band sitting on stage in front of the screen, ripping into their instruments, while videos played behind, it was pretty unique. The band hung around before and after and had beers with the masses too, nice blokes.
		 
			
			DJ Shadow at Komplex Zurich on 04.06   
and Arcade Fire at Montreux Jazz Festival on 10th July!!          I try and go every year, will be there all 4 days this time. If you like old school 90s hip hop they usually have a big name one evening or another. The rest is either French Pop / Reggae (so many hippies in NE) / usually decent electro and some kids singer on the Sunday afternoon which is when the families are there.    
  It was really crowded last year, I hope it'll be better organised (more bars, less VIP space) so getting drinks doesn't take half an hour. There's load of benches and what not so sit down on and it's by the lakeside so you can smoke by the rocks if you want. Thing of it as a Fete Des Vendanges you have to pay an entrance to and that has decent music. Well worth it... so long as it doesn't rain too much, but most of the place is covered by tents anyway.
		 
			
			Too bad I am not here!  
The  in Winterthur (15 min by train from Zürich!) is on in June, they have concerts from June 10-12th.               
ENJOY         playing Zürich 30th June
		 
			
			Anyone wanna join me in the Rote Fabrik to see Slim Cessna's Auto Club. Some band members from 16 Horsepower, in the theme of American folkrock, kinda.       
			
			Simian Mobile Disco playing Nordstern in Basel on Friday night and Cut Copy playing Hinterhof on 29th. Really looking forward to both.
		 
			
			CEREMONY is playing on the 28th of july in Dynamo in Zürich:       
Together with: 
LA DISPUTE 
TOUCHE AMORE 
DEATH IS NOT GLAMOROUS
		 
			
			...and still far ahead, but KVELERTAK is playing in the Abart in Zürich on the 1st of december:       
Together with:   
TOXIC HOLOCAUST 
TRAP THEM 
WOLVES LIKE US
		 
			
			Destroyer is playing Rote Fabrik on the 24th of June. His last album out-80s the 80s, and if the live show is anywhere near as batshit-bizarre as this video, it should be interesting.       
			
			Lenny Kravitz  at the Hallenstadion Nov.26 th  
Flogging Molly at the Komplex 457 Nov.17 th 
The Kooks at Komplex 457 Oct.26 th
		 
			
			the Cat Empire are playing at Komplex on the 12th November (tix on sale on the 29th June)
		    Yes - did I miss it?     
Can't believe I've only just found this thread    
			
			Just got back from seeing Filter at Abart. It was AWESOME! It's quite surreal seeing bands that I grew up listening to.  Back in the Republic of South Africa, it's a dream come true to see bands like this.  I'm very grateful to be able to have these experiences and see these band that I admire and really love.
		 
			
			Sebadoh at Abart in Zürich on August the 15th. Grungey!       
			
			Just happened to notice Fleet Foxes are playing at Komplex 457 on 21.11...some way off yet I know! As much as I like their albums I'm not sure about seeing them live - anyone seen them before?
		 
			
			^ I haven't seen Fleet Foxes before, but I'll be there.   
also, awesome aussies cloud control are playing at hafenkneipe 19.09.11. great band, lovely people.
		    Not quite my thing but very good live, I've heard.
		 
			
			Switzerland has its fair share of good gigs!!!      always has a good line up.   
And the Red Hot Chili Peppers are playing in Zurich before they even come to the UK!!!! Dec 13th at Hallenstadion!
		 
			
			The Dub Pistols are playing in Fribourg tomorrow night, 2nd July, as part of Fribourg Jazz Parade. Don't really know much about them, but sound right up my street.          Generally regarded as having given a very weak performance at Glasto last weekend.
		 
			
			Manic Street Preachers are playing at the Winterthurer Musikfestwochen on Sunday 28.08.11:          @ Plaza, ZH, 01.11.11. Tickets  .
		 
			
			11.10.2011 - Beady Eye @ Volkshaus, Zurich 
Tickets are going on sale tomorrow ( )
		 
			
			Not Zürich but definately worth the trip - The Antlers play St. Gallen 3rd December.
		 
			
			Some bands work much better in a venue then at a festival. Actually most bands do.       
			
			Hi we're just moving down from Lux in Sept and in the past few weeks have seen Foals, PJ Harvey - Prince played here etc etc. There is a good music scene here and it's advertised of 2 main websites, is that the case in Zurich or Switz as a rule? 
Thanks
		    Arse - back in the UK then. The last album was a corker .... back to the old form
		    Sunday August 14 - Zofingen - Heitere Open Air Festival
		    It's ok. There's a lot of bands that don't come. As Far as I'm aware PJ and Foals have never been.
		    PJ plays Paleo I believe, this weekend. And I'll miss her       Tickets available on ricardo if you want them.    
I'm just going to pretend that I meant Zürich.
		    Nope ... Foals played at Abart last year. Zurich is not that bad after all       I didn't say i was bad, just ok! I'll revise my opinion when Radiohead come and play on their next tour.
		    damn, only one Swiss date??    
Will you be seeing them on the UK leg of their tour DP?
		    I am going to see them in Hastings.  Just a few minutes walk from my house

			aug 9 - dillinger escape plan at bad bonn (dudingen) 
aug 12 - meshuggah, the ocean, +more at rock altitude festival (le locle)         
			
			Zurich: Wednesday 17th August   
PRINCE!!       
There are no more standing tickets left from ^ that ticket link, but I found mine from a UK website
		 
			
			The concert from prince in cologne arena was absolut rubbish, he played 
one song, left the stage for 50 mins, returned for anonther 65 mins and left 
early after a total of 75 mins played, some people payed about 150 euros for a seat.         That's a shame. He's usually one of the best live acts out there (imo) 
I hope he'll not be doing the same in Zurich
		 
			
			Friendly Fires will definitely be worth a look....   
Sadly I won't be able to make it - but I recommend   (Abart, 8th Sept)

			Great baltimore duo Wye oak are playing at Fri-Son, Fribourg 10.11.11 (sadly no ZH show   )              they're playing geneva too on the 7th. thanks for the heads up.
		     
Saw them a couple of years ago at that very spot.  Was very, very loud, we got very drunk, one mate got into a fight in the mosh pit and was almost thrown out, another ended up sleeping under a mattress in a squat somewhere in Zurich.
		 
			
			I'd like to recommend the songkick.com website, it's brilliant. 
It scans your iTunes library or you can quickly and easily choose the interests that interest you as well as the cities and you have a personalized calendar and receive emails when concerts of interest are announced.
		 
			
			Brilliant !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		     
This is spam but the songkick iOS app is pretty good.
		                i'll be there! in lausanne as well!  )

 Tickets went on sale this morning...I got mine at starticket      
V excited...though I might get over that by January       I've heard the Spice Girls are reforming, maybe that's more to your tastes?
		    Oh and you sadly missed Biebef by a couple of weeks, I'm afraid.

			Not so much a Heads-up, more of an ""Oh Bollocks"", but did anyone catch the Buzzcocks in Aarau last Saturday? Any good? I missed it as I was in the UK.        Saw them last year when the played Zug OpenAir (free festival) it was nice to say I'd seen them but tbh they were nothing special at all.

			For all you Vaud jazzers,   is coming to Chorus, Lausanne, 15 October 201, with his Migration band.  This is a musician/drummer not to be missed if you can make the gig.  Reservations will be necessary, I am sure.   
Antonio has many projects, but those of you in the know will recognize him as Pat Metheny's drummer in his PMG (Pat Metheny Group), the drummer since 2003.       
This is a big musician coming to Lausanne.

I'll be going there from Basel, so it would be great to have some company on the train there (and back).
		    Too bad Trap Them was cancelled for this show   They now got replaced by The Secret
		 
			
			Blue October are coming to Z-7 in Pratteln BL on 19 November.  I saw them once in Boston and it was a good show.  Too bad i am not in Basel then to see them again.

BLUE OCTOBER - Golden Ticket (64.50 CHF)

			Brit Bobby Long is playing on October 16 at Laborbar in Zurich at 20:00.  It will be a great show by a super talented artist!  If anyone's interested in going, let me know!   is his website if you want to check out his music....
		 
			
			Perhaps this could be interesting for some people: the people from the Kilbi festival in Düdingen/Bad Bonn will launch something like a   in winter - 9th/10th December in Exil (and Moods) Zurich.   
Particularly looking forward to Glenn Branca Ensemble and Thurston Moore. It's a little pricey (85.- for both days), though it's worth it for me.
		    presents  .   
The concert will be held on  at  , at   in Burgweg 7, 4058 Basel.   
You can buy tickets for 24 CHF through  ,  , at SBB and Post. Or you can buy it at the venue for 26 CHF from 21h on the night of the gig.   
The concert itself starts at 22h, but there will be a party at around midnight with DJ Edin and DJ Bob Rock playing Balkan/electro music.   
Kultur Shock plays some sort of Balkan music/rock/metal/punk fusion, and they are particularly good live. Well see for yourselves:       
and the same track live at exitfest 2010 in Novi Sad, Serbia:       
Great huh?! }:-) 
See you there!
		 
			
			Don't forget: British Sea Power are playing at the Abart, ZH this Wednesday 12.10.11. They had to cancel their ZH show twice before, so fingers crossed they'll make it this time!           
			
			pretty much my reaction too, with an few choice expletives thrown in though. I did regain my composure long enough to selflessly post it here, thinking it might help some deserving music fan out that way catch them.          Good concert, though I was pretty drunk. Place seemed to empty by the end of the gig, shame really, but as their last album was their worst so far then I'm not surprised.
		 
			
			Just got my Tickets for   at Stall 6, 6th November.   
For techno heads, Richie Hawtin is playing as  , Komplex 457, 22nd October.   
Probably also going to see   on 21st November.

			Saharan blues from Tinariwen at Kaufleuten in Zurich on Saturday 15th October. If you've not heard them live and like riddim then it's the concert for you. A major influence on so many records recently.   
I happen to have two tickets for this show for sale at cost price  .       
			
			Has it sold out? I was considering it but won't decide until Saturday. I'll post again on sat just in case you haven't sold them.
		 
			
			Glasgow-based band   are playing at Papiersaal, ZH, on Wednesday 19.10.11. I'm liking them a lot lately, and I reckon they'll be great:         (I've also got some free tix if anyone wants them: http://wp.me/pLHpb-1i4)   
			
			The Italian electro-rock band   is visiting Basel.   
The gig is starting at 21h on 30th of October in Grenzwert bar (Rheingasse 3, in Kleinbasel).      to their profile with more of their work.   
And a small glimpse on what you might expecting a few weeks:     
So if you feel like changing your Swiss routine, you can start by going out on Sunday evenings as well. }:-)   
See you there!
		 
			
			Not my kind of music - normally, but they have some catchy pop songs which put you in a good mood. Swiss - German music   - in English.

		    We rarely read reviews after the event on this thread, so I'll keep it brief: It was very good   Support act François & The Atlas Mountains had some interesting beats but strange, Eno-esque dance moves, which were a bit theatrical, but in all very West Coast French dance melancholia. Anna Calvi's voice is a joy to hear. Nuff said.   
Oh Hai GastroGnome! I tried to grab ya but you had more beauties surrounding you than I did, so I didn't want to steal your thunder       I was there too! I'll be writing a review soon (on my blog, though, will post a link), just haven't had a moment. We should do a meet up at the next suitable gig, what do you think?

Stephen Malkmus and The Jicks on Friday at Abart.     
*bows*
		    not my alltime favorite but on my must-see list for a long time.    
might be worth a drive from lausanne but the tuesday night thing is a killer.
		 
			
			A bumper week for music in ZH next week! Obviously getting to all of them may involve some kind of cloning technology   but here are my tips:       
			
			I'd love to say The Kills were great last night, but due to the   sound at X-tra, it's hard to say.    
Not the first time either - I'm not going to waste my hard earned on that venue anymore.
		     Were you upstairs or downstairs?   
I find if you are right in the middle upstairs the sound is not so bad.

			Sisters of mercy (chf 55) and its at xtra in zurich. Date 23rd November 2011   
I've got a spare ticket for the above   
If you're interested please pm me
		 
			
			looking forward for the sisters of mercy tomorrow and on thursday! can't believe i have never seen them before!    
next days' schedule:     
tomorrow: work, drive to zürich, gig, drive back 
thursday: train to lausanne, work, gig, sleep 
friday: drive back, work 
saturday: drive to zürich, vive la fete gig 
sunday: drive back, probably spend day on sofa 
monday: work, drive to zürich, fakir's gig, drive back ?   
why do all the bands chose to play at the same time and almost never in bern??
		    I was bang in the middle, about a foot behind the sound desk. Logically I would have thought the best place for sound in the venue...       yes,that is normally the best spot  . Try upstairs next time if you can.
		    price negotiable, if anyone is interested
		    mhm, the last time when there was paul kalkbrenner, sound was fine?!  
same with belle & sebastian and morcheeba.
		 
			
			sisters of mercy gig at the xtra was pretty good but the sound quality was terrible, more due to xtra than the sisters. not the first time a gig has been ruined for me at the xtra due to useless sound quality
		 
			
			Right, don0t know what the problem there is. The second half of the gig was much better.          Skindred are an awesome band - saw them at Download a couple of years back.  DK Murphies are a must see too - saw them in boston last year.
		 
			
			anyone going to any of these?   
the horrors - tomorrow night 
smashing pumpkins - next fri 2nd dec 
dEUS - next sat 3rd dec 
thurston moore - sat after 10th dec   
im new to town (zurich) but will be headinbg to these gigs, so feel free to say hi!   
(especially if you know where i can buy vimto...)
		 
			
			I'll be at the Horrors tonight, gimme a shout if you want to meet up. I know of a few Asian stores in Oerlikon which sell Vimeo that I can give you directions for ^^
		 
			
			sounds good       i'll most probably be at the dEUS one! and also at dEUS in neuchatel on the 6th     
thurston moore, i thought i was going but it's on the same date as FAQ's gig in Aarau   
and i think i'm probably going there, as the partying will surely be better!    
i had some friends seeing smashing pumpkins in london a few weeks ago and they were very disappointed (and they are pretty big fans). so i'm not going (to be fair, i wouldn't go anyway as i'm not crazy about them)   
we seem to like similar music, so feel free to come and say hi tomorrow at Fakir's show in kaffi für dich (details a few posts above).
		 
			
			Hi Crimson, I'll see I will see about monday night, tho i tend to work late at the moment. I'll def be at dEUS tho, my fav band! That should be ace. it woul dbe good to go to the show on the 6th as well but, work!   
Shame to hear your friends didnt like the pumpkins recently, i had friends at copenhagen, manchester and london gigs and they were nothing but loving the shows. they are the band that usually suprise me most at shows with how amazing they are, but i shall see!
		 
			
			i hope you will enjoy the sp show! let us know!    
dEUS are perfect. every time i see them i can't get over how great they are. and they are not even my favourite band! (but amongst the top ones anyway)

The Musical Box is a highly professional canadian Genesis tribute band. They bring the early Genesis years - when Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett were still in the band - back to life. They recreate their vintage shows as original as possible. The sounds, the sights, the costumes, the lights, the everything. They are very approved by the original band. Phil Collins even played a show or two with them. This time they will play the ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"" show in its entirety. It's rumoured that original Genesis guitarist   will join them for the encores!

			Hi Everyone,     
while I had my head in the books studying for exams I forgot to do something very important (buy Noel Gallagher tickets at Komplex 457). Now they have sold out and I am kicking myself(!). If anyone has 2 spare tickets that they would like to sell or knows of a way that I can legally acquire said tickets, I would be most appreciative    
cheers

			woo.     play Zurich's Volkshaus 7th March. From CHF55.-     play 13th March in Zurich's Kaufleuten. From CHF50.-      play 16th March in Zurich's Kaufleuten. From CHF50.-     
hoo.   
CHF300.- gone. just. like. that.                  I've got tickets for wilco, earth, bruce springsteen and mastodon. I am thinking of seeing the tindersticks (brilliant in geneva in 2010, good in zurich in 2011) and lambchop. I saw lambchop a few years ago in the rote fabrik and they were dreadful, the band was sloppy, the crowd got bored and people started to go home. they must have had a fight because there was lots of banter between them which didn't involve the audience. this was promoting the damaged album.
		    I was at that gig: it was US Independence Day. Talking backstage with them during the interval Kurt and MacManus were talking about being TourBlind: it was getting tired and no longer personal. They wanted to be with their families, especially on that night. After a peace pipe, they came back on and played some haunting stuff, which many didn't enjoy, as you note. The banter was down to, er, the pipe, me thinks.   
Crap jokes were still crap, though. Can't wait to see them again.
		 
			
			for any Radiohead fans out there..    
I just got an alert on Facebook saying Radiohead tickets go on sale tomorrow  (31january) for a performance at Montreux 09 July
		 
			
			I got mine   who else will be there?          thanks that explains it, I have been thinking about that gig for years wondering why such a fine band had such a night
		    Gah! Thanksgiving. It was November. Don't know my foreign national holidays.

Glass Swords is one of the best albums of last year, though TBH, the appeal may not be immediately obvious.
		    Thanks for this old advice Jimmy Bee! I did not make the concert last year but went tonight to see him at Moods, he was playing with his Primitive Horn Orchestra...       Yes, brilliant music. But their concerts should be black and white.
		    Haha! So true....      - are you sure you are ""working"" out of the country for three months? Pretty sure me and Prof T saw you playing the drums last night in the Primitive Orchestra!

			Hi everyone, I'm new to this forum, so please bear with me, at least for a while. I was thinking to create a group on Meetup for people that go to concerts in Zurich, and perhaps want to go with someone else or bigger crowd.Would anyone be interested to join?    
I'm thinking (next few months) :   
26.03 Damien Jurado (el Local) 
31.03 Olafur Arnalds (moods) 
02.04 Veronica Falls (Mascotte) 
28.04 Bowerbirds (el Local) 
29.04 Laura Gibson (el Local) 
06.06 Tortoise (moods)   
If sth like that already exist let me know of course, i might have missed it.

Headliners on August 24th:     Franz Ferdinand   
Headliners on August 26th:     Flogging Molly     
			
			The   lineup is pretty damn good, especially the Saturday: Afghan Whigs, Mudhoney, and Lee Ranaldo.      Canadians Unit!      is playing at Parterre in Basel on April 7th!   
For anyone who hasn't heard this Canadian gem, they are highly acclaimed and having seen them in concert back in Manitoba, they are amazing live.           Hello and welcome to the Forum. You can post concert events on the mysteriously invisible*   or under   ( if you're a promoter or financially involved).   
Putting a concert / event on the calendar gives it greater exposure and allows for some 'buzz' (is this what the kids call it these days?).   
Also, you can set up a  . This particular thread can be hard work to get overview, so lead from the front!   
*Must look into why it doesn't show under the Events icon    
			
			this is a 'wee bit early but if there are any Diana Krall fans out there she will be playing Lucerne in November ( she just sent me an email to let me know )    
and hopefully there will be a couple more Swiss dates showing up.       
			
			AND.............   
any Pink Martini fans... ??    
they  (+/- China Forbes ? ) will be performing at the Verbier Festival 01August    
( tickets for this and all Verbier festival events just went on sale at noontime today )

Reggae...   
			
			The Concerts calendar is now added to the Events menu - thanks Editor Bob.    
As it's tricky getting overview of posts made in this thread perhaps consider adding a concert to the concerts calendar if you intend going as this may encourage others and it'll build our social opportunities.    
Lambchop play Kaufleuten in Zurich tonight. As I'm not attending - sad - I won't post it on the calendar, but were I to be going...   
Keep on rockin' in the free world.

where do i get the permission ?

			MAZZY STAR is playing in the Rote Fabrik in Zürich on the 18th of July         MOD EDIT: Nickelback thread merged   
I have never met an actual fan of this band.   
I'm sure they have some, but are probably too embarrassed to admit it. I don't blame them.
		   They've sold over 50 million albums, allegedly
		 
			
			I've been wanting to see Mazzy Star for years but alas I'm on holiday that day!
		 
			
			the song about the panties down by the ankles is cringeworthy
		    The same fans that think Bon Jovi are a great ""heavy metal band"" or ""Survivor"" and ""Europe"" kick ass.*           (*Um, they don't ....)   
			
			here's a great video with all the wikipedia 'updates' on Nickelback over the years.     
Some are very informative and amusing            
I guess I'll be dancing alone then           Canada has enough awesome music.    
Nickelback is just the Canadian reaction to Creed.

( I'm not overwhelmed personally )
		 
			
			Looking forward to RPWL at the Galery Music Bar in Pratteln this evening:       
Although the Z-7 crew are promoting and selling tickets, the venue is the Galery just down the road, not the Z-7 black hall.   
RPWL started life as a Pink Floyd covers band, but they've had their own progressive style for more than a decade now, their latest CD ""Beyond Man and Time"" is very good melodic rock.
		    I'd go just to see Janelle Monae. She's amazing
		    I like the line-up but can't understand why it's called Montreux ""Jazz"". Been to Cully last weekend, much jazzier there and a fantastic atmosphere.
		 
			
			Would love to see Tony Bennett but tickets are very expensive
		    I guess it's kind of hard to change the name midride.... and much of nowadays music is influenced by jazz (the good stuff at least)
		 
			
			Eagles of Death Metal are playing in Solothurn on the 21st of June.           
Nothing remarkably new or mindblowingly good, but never fail to entertain live. I'd go just to see Jesse Hughes do his little dance.

Saw him a few years ago at the wonderful bastion of downtown bohemia El Lokal, but almost fell asleep. He has a massive following but somehow he's lost his bite.    
Chicks dig him though, so see you there.
		    Definitely a victim of his own prolificacy.   
He is my beard mentor though, I'll be heading along for some ad hoc trimming tips.
		    MOLOTOV will also play in Winterthur, Salzhaus,

Tickets are on sale at   for a WHOPPING 78,60 plus the print at home fee makes it an 80 CHF ticket... I don't get why they charge us to print out the ticket at home.. that should be free right?   
			
			Quite a treat: starting on Friday, 16th November at the Reitschule in Bern is the   festival, celebrating 15 years of Constellation Records. Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Do Make Say Think, and A Silver Mt. Zion, amongst others.       Godspeed also in Zürich's Rote Fabrik for 35chf    
Can't wait! Although I've never seen them live so I have no idea what to expect...

			The Tindersticks ( ) and the Maccabees ( ) are playing in Fri-Son in November. Don't realy know a great deal about either band, but will have a butchers at YouTube and might pop along to one or the other.   
Edit: Sorry, had wrong dates.
		          The Tindersticks are a brilliant band, check out their second album with this cover (   and Curtains:   
The music is melancholic, moody, orchestral   
They can be brilliant live especially when they have their string and horn sections in tow.   
I fully recommmend them and good luck!
		    Thanks for the heads-up on this @Crumbs.  Can't wait!    
			
			What is it with the XTRA venue in Zürich?The sound quality is truly dreadful. I have seen several live bands there and I have always noticed the poor sound quality. Only the supremely organized or very loud acts seem to be able to overcome the poor sound quality of this venue.
		 
			
			Thanks PaddyG, I've been wanting to see the Maccabees for years :-). Seen Tindersticks, not really my bag.       
			
			I'll be going to:

			I've got tickets for Fleetwood Mac on 13-10-2013 at the (wretched) Hallenstadion in Zurich and I'm really excited about seeing Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie and the two lucky guys
		    There have been rumours about (no pun intended  ) that Christine McVie may also appear on the tour
		    I'm glad to hear it but I thought she'd retired completely, she really has to sing her songs, Stevie Nicks has too country a voice to sing Christine's songs imho. I'm also really looking forward to seeing Buckingham, a seriously underrated guitarist, play

They are appearing at Z7 in Pratteln on May 9th.     
This as a trailer to their debut album 'Dimensionaut'.  It should appeal to all prog. rock fans.          Thanks for the heads up. Saw them last night at the Stadthalle in Sursee. It was just like it would be to see the real Pink Floyd playing in a high school basketball gym. Fantastic!

I'm finally going to get to see one of my favourite bands!    
			
			Nouvelle Vague play Kaserne in Basel on 2nd October. I have my tickets :-)           
btw what did you think of the gig? I wasn't impressed, I saw her last year in Geneva and she way way better
		    strange, i was also last year in geneva and did not enjoy it very much. i thought she was in a bad mood, whereas in zürich she was in a good mood   
i really liked the one in zürich and the one in montreux a couple of weeks later. still have the songs in my head. gotta love her.
		    i'm going as well! and to another place they're playing, could it be geneva? (yes too lazy to check)    
i've seen them live a few times already and i'm always impressed by the energy they bring on stage. much better than the cds in my opinion. you will love it!
		    Oh! I thought I might be the only one from here that would be interested. Maybe with the exception of Prof T.   
I saw Red Sky Coven a few years ago, but haven't managed NMA yet. Really looking forward to it.
		    exciting, isn't it?   see you there!    
			
			Fat Freddy's Drop, in Zurich 21st October       
will buy tix soon
		    god they were incredibily shit live 3 years ago at the kaufleuten. they sound like a local schoolband doing covers, far from their fab CD productions.

			For country fans, Band Perry will be in concert in Zurich at   on the 23rd of November.  Warm-up acts (not listed here) are:  Easton Corbin and a a dynamite guitar player from Canada, Lindsay Ell (her mentor was Randy Bachman of BTO).
		 
			
			I don't get the nouvelle vague love, for me its money for old rope.
		    well, some versions have a bit of fresh new paint to it or sound interesting though i am not a big fan. just got a ticket from a friend, so i just 'been there'. what i like about them is the nice singing voice of the girl that wasnt there at kaufleuten and therefor (sorry, lou) were rather like a fly buzzing around my head...
		 
			
			vive la fete are playing in bern this coming saturday. woop!        
			
			Hi guys, been lucky enough to follow some of the greatest bands around just before they ""made it"" (luck and friends, not me). Went to see this Swiss band absolutely amazing and a brilliant punctuation to my move to Sydney. I think Domi should be big and I mean BIG       This got good around the five minute mark.  Sounds like what would happen if you put Thom Yorke and the XX in the same room.
		    Really cool music but my god what a shocking voice. They really need a new singer...        You have a good point...Not everyone can be this guy:       
			
			Anyone going to see Lucero on September 18?
		    I gotta see her live one of these days, can't believe I have missed her so many times. Did she do Nude on the News?
		    nope, unfortunately! according to my catpower expert boyfriend (and kind of friend of hers) she refuses to play it
		    I can't have too much of her all the time, a bit too dramatic but Nude on the News is one of my all time favs, really. She is so spontaneous and talented. I hung with folks who went to see her a lot in Atlanta.
		    i cannot have too much of her at once as well. but i like her more and more as the years go by
		 
			
			So I went to see Nouvelle Vague on Wednesday night, the sound quality of the band was not so good but the singing was perfectly fine and the entertainment factor was excellent. Over all a great night out and a lot of fun; I would go and see them again.           maybe because her song is called Nude as the News... see! Catpower loves me more than you!    
			
			After skipping out on most of the festival scene this summer, I'm excited to see The Dirty Head and the iconic Sublime (with Rome) on Nov. 12 at Haerterei. Great show for those who enjoy the punk/ska/reggae cali scene.           
			
			Rude Zone Festival at Dynamo, Zurich, November 1st:     
with BAD MANNERS and RED SOUL COMMUNITY, ++support           
			
			Sea Sick Steve @ Komplex on the 2nd Nov. is gonna be great.    
			
			Has a spare ticket for Sea Sick on Saturday, worth 38.- will sell for 30.- send me a PM.
		 
			
			I'm going to the following shows in Zurich; if anyone wants to join on the end then you're more than welcome to get the first beers in.     play the Viadukt Bogen F; Thursday 7th November, 21:00, CHF35.-          (Sold Out but worth a visit for the Abend Kasse option) @ Rote Fabrik Friday 8th November, supported by Zurich group  ; well worth an early arrival. CHF28.-          plays Exil, Thurs. 14th Nov, CHF25.-         play the Rote Fabrik, 20:30, Thurs 21st Nov. CHF30.-        play the Rote Fabrik, Weds 20th Nov. 20:30 CHF25.- - an absolute snip!          plays the Rote Fabrik, Thurs. 5th. Dec 20:30 CHF25.-

		    Bad bonn kilbi is the best featival ever! In the middle of nowhere....highly recommended! I cannot go this year (getting married that weekend) but i cannot stress enough what a cool festival it is! 
Ps: if you go make sure to walk to the nearby lake and enjoy the beauty of thr scenery
		     
oh wow The Black Angels too! AND Mac Demarco!
		 
			
			Just seen the line up for Monteux Jazz 2015 and I don't think there is any artist that particularly stands out.  Perhaps they are keeping the best for next year as it will be the 50th one       
			
			thanks for the heads up, some good acts playing like Ibeyi, Foxygen, The Staves, Portishead, Sophie Hunger, Lionel Richie, Kronos Quartet, James Blake, Sly and Robbie, Anna Calvi, Alt J, Santana, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, George Benson,  etc etc   
but some serious crap as well, there is very little quality control going on these days
		 
			
			i'd also recommend dEUS and asaf avidan
		    I missed this, I love the Sleaford Mods!   
Otherwise a weak line up. I saw Thurston Moore with Sonic Youth at BKB a few years ago and they were lame. Highlight were the mighty Sunn O)))   
@crimson, I fully agree BKB is a great festival with a great vibe
		 
			
			Thurston Moore solo, I would go see. It is different, especially if he is in the mood.    
dEus is amazing. And James Blake.    
I want to see all that       Thurston Moore has different moods? How can one tell?
		    The left corner of his lips is about 2mm above the right one?   
I know    
But I do like drony stuff that washes over. There's certain poetry in a wall of noise.    
Which reminds me, completely unrelated, I gotta wish for a uke for my bday that is coming up

Nada Surf 22.04.2016 Dynamo 
We plan to be around ..just wondering
		    No idea but its May now, so you're most likely a little late.   
			
			recommended gigs in the VERY NEAR future (May) for Zurich:   
16.05: Dandy Warhols, Plaza (think of White Stripes with more fun)     
27.05: Porches, Klaus (from NYC - great fun)     
28.05: Dead Meadow, Club Zukunft (superb psych/garage band)     
29.05: Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Mascotte (surely no need to introduce them?)        anyway, they are a good band - very indie, if they come round again worth the trip.
		 
			
			Ezra Furman plays in Zurich tonight at Bogen F, 21:00.
		   play in Zurich at the  , 8th February.        
			
			I love them. ""Up with People"".   
Ezra Furman and his ""My Zero"" is MiniMC's ultimately fav song.
		    Doh! its the Missus's Birthday, oh well, I will just say its a surprise       Lambchop play Geneva the night before the Zurich gig; they play Luzern the night after.    
Ezra was ok the other night but the crowd seemed more happy to be there than enjoy being there, but that's the Swiss concert experience. He seemed tired.
		    I find that infuriating, in Zürich its about being seen at a concert but with absolutely no interest in the music! I am always telling people to stfu especially during quieter songs, when it seems the gig becomes a social gathering. The amount of times I have heard performers saying something about that during a performance, I don't think the Zürich audience gets it!    
			
			sooooo true....
		 
			
			Great thread. Any hint of U2 coming back...sadly passed us by last time (from a fans point of view that is).
		    It will be better when people start caring more for content than form. Being seen may also translate as liking the music, privately, you cannot expect a discrete culture all of a sudden show authentic affection in a prestigeous environment. The fact that the musicians and loads of listeners do not consider it prestigeous (the partisan opposite) is irrelevant.    
Les Grottes are great; in GE. Anti prestigeous. Weird enough stuff.
		    Lead from the front: dancing and enjoying yourself is the perfect way to get your square metre of space and will encourage the others. I was, however, told off by a woman once at a Nicolas Jaar gig for dancing. I apologised and told her next time I wanted to have fun I'd stay at home and listen on my headphones. Some just can't abide happiness in others.
		     
Hahahah. I am used to lead from the stage   , the best kind of hedonistic leadership.    
Well - I agree with you. There are places that support actual fun. And I also think that people do not dance for the same reason other stuff doesn't get done here, worried about spontaneity/authenticity being perceived as impolite, rude.    
I dance when I feel like it. Gigs, classrooms, balet halls, tents. I think the stiffness will change. A buddy of mine went to headphones party (4 diff music channels), she had to look for somebody dancing to the same stuff. Fun. And some rooms had no light. Gasp! Puritanism is on its way out of life.

		    well, if you enjoy watching 2 people get killed and 3 seriously injured, be my guest 
I personally find it disgusting to post a link to something like that on ""Jokes/Funnies"" 
I don't think that's funny and I frankly can't believe the admins haven't taken out the link.
		    An admin/mod posted it    
			
			I'm sure it wasn't glorifying the injuries and death.  You'll want no links to the crashes in the icy tunnel then        
			
			I did not say ""glorify"" anywhere - but to post a tram accident where people actually got killed (and you can SEE it on the video) does not belong in the ""Jokes/Funnies"" section in my opinion (or really anywhere else in a forum - I am surprised youtube hasn't pulled it, considering they pulled a few people dressed up as chipmunks/mickey mouse dry humping)   
But I'm just a humble new member and if the admins and mods of this forum think that this is quite okay, then maybe I am just in the wrong forum.
		 
			
			Whilst the tone of this thread was originally humour, perhaps you can consider the tram video to be something to remember when you're stood at a tram stop.   
It was not clear to me that people died but it does not surprise me.  It's an  -cum-  video - but I would not say that it warrants another thread.   
Prehaps common sense should prevail and those posting something that might upset should remark that it's of that nature?
		     Quote:        ""Two killed, three injured in tram accident in Prague  
(Updated at 1820 PST) <FONT face=Verdana size=2><SPAN style=""mso-fareast-font-family: Courier New; mso-bidi-font-family: Courier New"">    : A     killed at least two people and injured three others when it derailed early Wednesday and slammed into a group of people waiting to head to work at one of the Czech capital's busiest stops.
		 
			
			I can't edit my post for some reason and it took out all my links?    
The source was:                If this appeared on the news, it wouldn't even deserve a ""viewer discretion"" warning. It doesn't even warrant a Youtube ""viewer discretion"" warning. The quality of the picture is poor and there consequences of the accident are not distinguishable on the video.    
If people were killed or injured in this accident, it is unfortunate and sad. But that does not make this video distasteful IMHO. But in future, I will include a warning when linking to anything that would even remotely offend.

			Well some people like the Swiss TV ad, but the   ad is very amusing.
		    It's the jaunty music in the background that makes it        
An ad for Southwest Airlines from the 70s. Rather her than me, she nearly gets a haircut.      Ahh, yes, those 727 water-burners that spat out more noise and smoke than a steam train.       Surfing on snow is for wimps. Try   The guy died of leukemia, but I am sure if that hadn't gotten him he would have come ""unstuck"" one day.

			I don't think anyone has yet mentioned  :        
If you don't value your life very much, then it could be perfect for you. The video starts quite tame, but gets more and more wild.  Unfortunately, the YouTube version has lame music that doesn't nearly do it justice compared to the awesome music that accompanies the original version of the video available for download from   (download the video marked ""Drag Race NYC"", then turn up your speakers  ).

			This is a reply to Spanky's video about the cop doing the drink driving test. Amazing. But it begs the question - why haven't the cops in the US heard of a breath test? Blow in the bag or count to 10 and you are on your way. INstead they make people do dances and walk lines. Unbelieveable.   
By the way guys - if you post a youtube vid just give us a little bit of text about what it is and why you liked it, otherwise we might as well just go to the youtube site and browse ourselves.       Often because people challenge the results of those breathalyzer tests, but of course they still use them. It is typically necessary to produce video evidence of them being idiots to substantiate things in court if the citation is challenged. This is just my guess, as one always hears about challenges made against the breathalyzer test. However, I really do not think this whole dancing thing is typically -- could very well be faked, or just one of those rare cops being an idiot.
		    A breathtest is just a general indicator. Because it doesn't stand up in court they are then taken to the station for a blood test which does stand up in court. At least that's how it works elsewhere and much less time consuming than walking lines, filming idiots or repeating the alphabet backwards. I'm sure there's a blood test in the US as well and the strength of their case rests on more than videos like that...
		 
			
			I believe it has a lot to do with US law. I believe in many states a breath test can only be administered after someone fails a sobriety test.   
			
			Something you would never see on Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse...          NO, WAIT             I would say walking lines is less time consuming and less expensive than a blood test, especially if you are stopped on a stretch of interstate highway (i.e. motorway). This video, and the drunk man in it, look rather rural, so I would presume it would have taken quite some time to get to a station if it is real.

			The TGV is definitely living up to its name, setting a new speed record of 574.8km/h... or Mach 4.7 as a more relevant measure. Video commentary is french, but not important to the video.   
Video around the 3.30min is awesome....some serious vortexes streaming of this rocket. Although my tributes go to the track builders... only perfect permanent way and superelevation can allow this sort of speed on two rails.           
This is so funny and so typical.Jay Leno does the same sort of thing.But is it real....? The mind boggles.
		    Just now saw this. I've truly now given up all hope...   
It reminds me of how my father's wife once asked me how I was going to travel to Europe, when I was coming here for a visit. Uh, swim?
		 
			
			I just watched the video, and I agree it's pretty awesome. I'll just clarify a small point here:      The train is travelling at Mach 0.48, not 4.7. Normal airplanes, which travel at more than 800 km/h, don't even break the sound barrier. If Mach 4.7 was 574 km/h, you'd hit Mach 1 in your car at 122 km/h.

Uhm it's not really funny but here's how stupid some car drivers are when immersible metal poles come into play...          The one with the kid in the back could have been nasty....   
Reminds me of a football ""tour"" (one match weekend) I was once on. One of the guys, Steve, hired a minibus and drove us all up to South Shields. Having driven himself most of the way (four hour trip), we stopped off for some fuel and a change of driver. I'd be drinking in the back and volunteered to fill it up as everyone else went off to stretch their legs . Just following instructions I loaded it with diesel. We didn't get far! Steve was mortified with the spare driver and me.  
The AA came along and carted everyone off to the destination leaving me and the driver to wait in the car for four long hours on a friday night awaiting another AA van to come along drain the engine and get us going again.  
By the time we got there Steve was in a better mood, knowing the vehicle was unharmed by the experience. The next day we drove to the playing fields we were due to play out. Steve was back driving and saw a chance to get nearer the actual changing rooms by driving over one of these metal poles in its dormant position. True it did fick up as he did so, but we hardly noticed the noise and he pulled up drectly outside the changing rooms.   
Five minutes later we started to smell petrol. It didn't take much to discover that the minibus was the culprit, and it transpired that while the metal pole flicking back up had failed to stop us, it had succeeded in puncturing the petrol tank!   
Steve sunk back into his depressed state, with this time no one to blame but himself.   
But at least the same AA guys who had attended to us the previous night and found themselves attending to us yet again were able to see the funny side of it

			I'm talking Zits here. What do you do with yours....squeeze them, treat them or leave them.   
I'm a squeezer myself. I like to build the idea up in my head that that they are the precursors of cancer and if I do not expel them from my body they will integrate with my body and work on turning cells within in cancerous.    
Crazy I know, but it just adds that little bit of satisfaction to the successful squeeze   Mind you, the ones that don't come out easily, that just inflame the more you squeeze, are right pains.    
At the moment I've got one in the small of my back, an occasional itcher, which I can only just about reach with a fingertip myself but have no hope of getting enough hand on to facilitate a good squeeze. So I've told the wife to be on zit squeeze alert when I get back to the UK tonight. I'm hoping for a result like this....

		    German quote below from    
The guy's gonna be a millionaire. The World ain't just...   
""Paul Potts gewann die TV-Show «Britain's Got Talent» - und das, obwohl der Handyverkäufer eigentlich ein von Luciano Pavarotti persönlich ausgebildeter Opernsänger ist (20minuten.ch berichtete).    
Auch die britische Boulevardzeitung «Sun» berichtete am nächsten Tag über das Verschweigen von Pauls Vergangenheit - doch der Sänger war nicht mehr zu stoppen. In der heutigen Ausgabe der «Sun» heisst es denn auch: «Einige Zuschauer waren empört. Viele waren wütend, weil ihnen nie gesagt wurde, dass er ein professioneller Sänger ist, der von Pavarotti ausgebildet worden war...». ""
		 
			
			Lots of folk seem to be of the opinion that paul Potts is a professional singer.   
I found out that he appeared on a previous British talent show and although didn't come first, he used his £8000 winnings to travel to Italy and study further at one of the major opera schools. He was deemed to be good enough to sing in front of Pavarotti,   
He has sung in many amateur operatic productions but these have all been unpaid.   
As his income is derived from his day job in a mobile phone shop, he can be considered to be amateur.

			3 way animal encounter in South Africa's Kruger National Park. This has had over 10 million hits in 3 months. I've posted the BBC story about it first - then follow the Battle at Kruger link.    
It's quite amazing, but if you like baby animals and nature at its rawest is too much for you, you might find it distressing.          I'm sure you have heard the term, ""INDEPENDENT FRONT SUSPENSION,"" but many do not know exactly what it means. 
When one front wheel of a vehicle hits a bump or pothole, it will move up or down to compensate while the other wheel remains steady. Both wheels are independent of each other, hence that expression. 
Watch the attached video, a German commercial for the Nissan Pathfinder, to find out exactly how this works. This gives a moving experience which should benefit your understanding of this piece of engineering.

Here's an American (Texan) comedian who I really like. For my fellow brits, he's not very PC (but I've chosen a mild one here). Ron White talking about being ""Drunk In PubliKK - I had the right to remain silent. But I didn't have the ability""       
			
			Arright - here's one a little less PC (but still clean).           
how on earth can she do that?
		 
			
			Steroids and betablockers       Oh, c'mon...we've got to find a youtube of the ""cheese wheel"".  That one cracks me up.      I've got that one on Audio but I don't think it's on vid anywhere. What about ""Squirrel man""?        
Ouch! Let's not think about the scratches!       Yes, yes, ""squirrel man"" is fantastic.  I found some full-length videos in  .
		    ...
		    Before last night I'd never heard of Ron White. I listened to his stuff last night on Youtube. He mentions the ""Cheesewheel"" in the clip entitled ""You can't fix stupid part one"".       The squirrel man is given a mention in part four!!
		    Really? That's sad if true...  But, if you wanted to avoid prosecution, you could put anything at the end of your video, no?   
Well, while I'm here, I should contribute.  Sorry if someone's already posted these - some of my favs:   JT on SNL    Charlie Murphy!    Mario GTA

			Verana, the game is to find the longest   word from the 9 letters available.

		    That's cool. One mistake though and he's dead    
Too bad they didn't post the facial expression of the motorcyclists he passed lol
		    OK what about PULSANT? I just woke up. Satisfy my curiosity does the ballet dancer go anti clockwise for you?

		    A few weeks ago he was talking about selling suits. That was before his web site ( ) was turned into a Flash-based piece of junk where I now can't find diddly-squat.   
Note that each run down (should you make it that far) uses up a set of chest wheels because they're used for the braking.   
Another useless fact - the soundtrack is Muse's ""Map of the Problematique"".
		    I reckon those preparing the letters knew who the contestants would be and placed them in the right consonant and vowel order.   
Great hack!

			here's a clip from Rainbow (a popular UK kids TV programme from the 70's and 80's for those that don't know)    
Inuendo after inuendo, the script writers surely knew what they were writing.... but all the innocent kiddlywinks like myself never knew back then - very funny....       
			
			IIRC, this was produced for a laugh and not an actually broadcast episode. 
Still very funny  .          That was the story I heard too. Still funny of course.
		    Oh   spoilt my fun now, thought it was real.... ah well
		    Google can't see anything but videos there. I don't think there is anything else there.
		    Pulsant at 7 letters is fine (and matches Terry's FLAUNTS).   
Ah, the ballet dancer was wierd for me. It started out clockwise, but when I started concentrating on the text, it switched to anti-clockwise, and then back, once I switched my attention, and back again.   
I think that's saying I switch between both sides of the brain, which is in fact consistent with me being a bit of an all rounder - if I could have done, I would have chosen Maths, Physics and, er, French in my last 2 years at school.
		    Flaunts is better pulsant is a cheat. I've posted on the ballet dancer thread.

Not to ruin your diatribe against Hilary, who's a talentless hack and deserves your scorn, but that's not her singing. That version is by the pseduo-lesbo ruskie group TATU.       
And the only reason I know that is because   did an inventory of the worst remakes. If you're a glutton for punishment go check it out. I'd post the link here, but their search function seems to be broken.

Ok, it's not worst remakes, it's songs that shouldn't be remade. I personally think Hendrix's version of ""Watchtower"" is 100x better than Dylan's.

Reminds me once when flying Crossair to London City as well, we did a touch-and-go, then came around for a second try at a landing..!!! I've never had wetter palms in my life as on that second try..       
note: in case you haven't figured it out on your own, we landed safely on that second try       One time flying into Schippol I could have sworn we   landing at 45°.    
			
			Dont race with Lithuanian police   ...
		    Thanks for clearing that up. Reminds me of one day I was working the other side of the Thames under the flightpath (in lovely Thamesmead  ) on a really windy day. I swear the planes were coming in at almost 45º sideways and a number of them had to make at least 2 attempts. Maybe it was the same day!   
I has sweaty palms from all the muggers around.
		 
			
			This is bizarre..... there is a   showing the maturing of a 44 lb Cheddar Cheese in Somerset. They have made this You Tube time lapse video of the last 12 months.          
			
			Out of interest, how long does a medium or extra maturecheddar take to mature?
		    A good Farmhouse cheddar should mature for at least a year, the one I recently had was nearly 2 years old, not as ripe or powerful as you might think, it was dry but still had a very creamy flavour with some natural blue veins.   
Polorise has just been sent the last bit!
		 
			
			Mmmm Thanks for that info. When I am here full time I WILL be in touch for you to send me some....

			This is actually a copy/paste of an email I recieved from my brother, but I thought I would stick it up here in the interest of promoting their music....   
I'm not into Christian music myself, but in case you are you can download my Sister in laws' album for free from      Hello to Our Friends - Most of you are aware that Jan was recording a CD over the last few months and now it is ready for release along with her website - go to her web site at www.janlawton.com and have a look. For some of you the music may not be your thing, that's OK but I'll still show you what we've been up to anway.      In fact the CD is available for free download in HIGH QUALITY MP3 (scanned at 300kb - you can't get any better) - and we are giving away 10,000 free downloads via our website. Go and have a look and if you'd like a listen download a copy - if you'd like a real CD just email me and I'll mail you one when they come in in about 2 weeks.      What you can do to help us though if you're so inclined is to tell all your friends about the free download offer - in order to get record companies interested in offering Jan a contract we need to demonstrate an interest in her music. 10,000 downlaods achieved will go along way towards that - but I need you tell all your friends about the free CD to help us out.      The other nice thing here is that I can stick it to all the CD pirates out there because everyone can just go and download it for free they don't have to burn pirate copies!! And unfortunately Christians are some of the worst CD pirates out there beleive it or not, but that's another story.....but I've fixed them - right! :-)     The other way you can help us is to go to Jan's MySpace site at www.myspace.com/janlawton1 - if you have a myspace account add Jan as a friend - what this does is starts to put the web page up the music chart ranking within MySpace and it can potentially be featured artist links and searches in MySpace which then directs more people to her website and so on.      Helping out won't cost you anything other than a few minutes to hit those sites for us and then email all your friends who'd like a FREE CD download.     If you have any feedback of course we would be interested in your comments.     Best Wishes      You're not the only one who            
			
			One of my foolish friends sent me this link and now I can't get the tune out of my head!!!           HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  
Today is the third birthday of You Tube    
""It is the birthday of the popular Internet Web site YouTube (the domain name was registered on February 15, 2005). In its few short years in existence, YouTube has become a cultural phenomenon. It is the Internet's fourth most popular Web site, and it receives millions of visitors a day. One of the results of YouTube is that ordinary people now have a chance at fame (or infamy). Time magazine's 2006 Person of the Year was You, partly due to the rise of YouTube.""

			yet another spoof on the Tom Cruise interview             
Wow. This video has legs. A colleague showed it to me a couple of weeks ago. My wife is Czech and knows the song. She even sings along with it. My 2-year-old is now obsessed with the song and sings it too.   
The english translation of the lyrics can be found  .
		 
			
			I received a new PC recently and reinstalled all software.  
When I watch youtube videos from the EnglishForum website, they stop after about 2 seconds and only resume if I click them in the right place, then they stop after another 2 seconds.   
When I watch embedded animations (even the exact same you tube video) from other web sites, they play normally. EDIT : No they don't - just tried again and the videos on you tube also stop after a short time. Must be the plugin then.   
Can anyone tell me if there is something different about EF. I am using XP with firefox 2.0.0.12 and the main (significant) software differences between this PC and my old one, is that I installed realplayer 11 instead of 10 and adobe professional 8 instead of 7. Are there any plugin related strangenesses that would cause EF to behave differently from other web sites? Either way, should I uninstall whatever plugin is playing youtube videos and install a different one.   
TIA

			Don't mess with the cows round here...        Typical gratis newspaper... It wouldn't surprise me if none of these were censored anywhere on the world... They are English so obviously they weren't made for the Swiss market and a couple of these are as old as the internet!         I don't have to say that Felix is BSing you don't I? The first translation actually is ""I prefer my beer lukewarm""... moderately funny, or fit for Swiss TV, if you want.    
And now, another commercial:          Nooooooooo........ really...?

			This video is from a 419 Scam Baiter, one of those guys who replies to Nigerian 419 Scams e-mails with a better offer for the Scammer. In this case he replied saying he was a Hollywood stunt man and needed to recruit new stunt men, of course offering loads of money. The scammer sent in these video clips of him auditioning for the part.   
It is very easy to feel sorry for this guy (he clearly hurt himself a few times here) but remember that he was trying to steal money from innocent people, and has most likely succeeded in the past.

			What starts off as a very innocent In-Cab-Video footage from an American freight train in signalled territory. I am wondering when the crew knew the opposing train had  cocked it all up. Was it when?   
1. The home signal prematurely reverses from Red-over-Orange to Red-over-Red? (indicating the opposing train had passed its red signal) (00:38)   
2. They noticed clouds of brake dust streaming out from under the opposing train?    
3. The driver of the opposing train jumps belly first onto the ballast? (00:42)   
If they waited until Nr.3, they had about 2 seconds to say ""WTF!!!"" No fatalities apparently. Driver at fault was stoned...       
And of course then there is non-signalled tracks, also known as ""dark"" territory, because its the blind leading the blind. This is what happens when the previous crew ""forget"" to re-align the points for the mainline:          Made me something...

			Blonde Swedish Twin Girls Go Wild in the Fast Lane.... 
Saw this on tonight's BBC news and was shocked.       
""On no account miss this documentary, which was originally scheduled for last week. 
It opens with what is perhaps the most extraordinary footage I've seen on TV - although it's not cars or juggernauts that led to the M6 being closed in both directions back in May this year. 
The culprits were two pedestrians - Swedish sisters, walking alongside the motorway.   
Although this is an offence, it's not unusual. But their reaction when officers Paul Finlayson and Tracey Cope stopped to have a word with them defies belief. 
As the girls decide to make a run for it, what happens next might just remind anyone who watched Heroes of a certain shatter-proof cheerleader...""  
(   )   
Not on Youtube yet and not fuuny but newsworthy (4 months later)
		    I saw this as well and it defied belief. I could not comprehend what the girls must have been thinking of.   
The strength of the one who got up after being hit by a car on the motorway was unbelievable. It took 6 officers to restrain her when she got up and ran away across the motorway for the second time. They showed remarkable restraint.

			I like the lyrics!      Thunder Road Lyrics      The screen door slams
Mary' dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch
As the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again
I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside
Darling you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking
That maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but hey you're alright
Oh and that's alright with me 
You can hide 'neath your covers
And study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers
Throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a saviour to rise from these streets
Well now I'm no hero
That's understood
All the redemption I can offer girl
Is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey what else can we do now ?
Except roll down the window
And let the wind blow
Back your hair
Well the night's busting open
These two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back
Heaven's waiting on down the tracks
Oh-oh come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh-oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run
Oh Thunder Road sit tight take hold
Thunder Road 
Well I got this guitar
And I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back
If you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride it ain't free
And I know you're lonely
For words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free
All the promises'll be broken
There were ghosts in the eyes
Of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines roaring on
But when you get to the porch they're gone
On the wind so Mary climb in
It's town full of losers
And I'm pulling out of here to win

I'm guessing it's something light like foam with velcro on the side of it as it obviously is just sticking to the catcher's outfit.
		 
			
			More than the technique employed to produce the video, I find that the most striking aspect is that apparently the market segment of homosexual laptop users is worth targeting with a dedicated publicity campaign.
		     
If they're foam, they wouldn't fly so fast, would they?

ps: please pardon if posted before          Ha Bloody Ha!     Just watched this 1978 classic again and feel like these alien life forms must have managed to settle pretty well here and get everyone to adapt to the zombie like way of being and living and behaving 'normally':          Either that or the director, Philip Kaufman, must have some experience of the Swiss mentality... well, blow me! Wikipedia mentions the following:   
""After spending some time backpacking in Europe with his wife, Kaufman relocated back to the United States. His time in Europe heavily influenced Kaufman's decision to become a filmmaker...""     I feel a bit like Donald Sutherland at the mo'.. best not get too complacent and nod off!

			This is a great, feel-good   video made by 172 students at l'Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) -- their music video of   by The Black Eyed Peas.   
This was posted on YouTube on 11 September this year and has garnered over 1 million views already!       
			
			Wow...that looked like all one long take, no cuts. Amazing planning.
		    It was indeed one take and believe it or not, they only shot the video twice -- first time was rehearsal, second time was ""it"".  The whole process only took 2 1/4 hours!   
The organisers spent a month planning the shoot, but the 172 students who took part in the video only met that morning!  (The video was shot at the university's orientation day for new students.)
		 
			
			At about the 2 minute mark it gets really good.                   Love the Kai Tak approach -- I remember landing in Hong Kong a few times in 1998, with the plane banking steeply to get around a mountain, then descending on final approach well below the tops of residential apartment buildings on both sides.  I could clearly see the residents on their balconies at the same level as my cabin window.   
There were relatively few accidents at Kai Tak, and none in living memory due to the difficult approach, as far as I know.

			These people were always finding water all over their pool deck and furniture, every time they came home, after being away for a few hours. They thought the neighbourhood kids were watching for them to leave, and using the pool. However, they could never catch them doing it. So they set up their video cam and watched the pool area. This is what they recorded.......                   Hilarious!- whenever I feel I behaved like a prat, I will play this to remind myself that everyone is a prat at some time.

			This was funny to watch yesterday. 
Two cheeky chappies from Barnsley ran onto the pitch in the second half, got the ball from the Manchester United keeper (Ben Foster - what a surprise) and set up their own little goal and did a diving celebration.   
No one stopped them. They were running around the pitch for a good while.   
The TV cameras obviously didn't continue to show the guys larking around so you saw players on opposite sides (marking each other) watching on smirkiing and chatting to each other. 
A nice moment. 
Here's the two fans goal and celebration.

			Definitely not PC with objectionable language- but what else can one expect from South Park.  When I first saw it I thougth they were sinking Somali pirates.

This reminds me of the shoe throwing incident at Hyde Park in 2006. Texas were playing while the England v Portugal World Cup semi-final was at the penalty shootout stage on a big screen at the back of the arena. Some people thought that they should have stopped playing until after the match.

			I don't know if I like this, I like the sound but I just don't understand the purpose- just that someone (probably students) had a lot of time on their hands. Can it play different tunes- if so themI am impressed but to play the same thing over and over?          Cool video, but obviously an animation... so I do not believe the story of the students building it up - unless they build it in their computers        That's what I thought but this is the story..... apparently?        
			
			Not actually on youtube, but funny anyways.          Just because someone writes it on Youtube, it does not really need to e true, does it?       A fake, but a nice animation.

I've never seen them used in a commercial like that! I like it!        LOL! Okay hahha!       Oh that's interesting. Yeah I don't mind good people having guns because the criminals will get them no matter what laws are in place so any gun laws only keep the good people unarmed and make them more of a victim to the criminals. Criminals who break the law to rob & kill will not hesitate to break gun laws, only   citizenss would honor any gun laws thereby leaving the good people undefensive to an intruder or robber. Interesting video.

Here's another funny commercial, remember the Big Red chewing gum commercial from the 80's & 90's? I used to love those commercials. Now look at this one from Verizon. hahahah! Too funny!       LOL! That is too funny!    
Here's the Big Red Chewing gum commercial from the 80's that this one is using. LOL!

		    Aaawww that is so sweet and amazing! Bless his little heart!   Yeah I saw something like that on a show called Life's Little Miracles, it used to come on the health channel and one episode was where a 3 year old who was deaf from birth got the implant and they showed the moment when she heard her first sound which was her mom's voice talking to her. It was so cute and funny she was playing with blocks or something and they turned it on and the mom spoke to her and she dropped the blocks and looked up at her mom in amazement. LOL! That was too cute her eyes were big and she was looking around at the different sounds she was hearing for the first time.  It is so cute. I love videos like this this one, just amazing!   Very good post!
		    Thanks- I used to work in diagnostic audiology, it alleviated some of the painfull memories of mother's realizing the extent of their child's deafness while carryig out tests. Thank goodness for modern medicine-although cochlear implants are not a cure-all.

			Funniest thing I've seen in ages.               
Its a great clip yet won't be aired due to many negative comments.   
Sesame Street got many angry emails when this was aired on the net, saying it was not appropriate to show and now suitable for kids eyes.   
A shame as its funny, what could people have against Elmo and Katy    
No one seems to care Elmo runs around naked on tv, so why would Katy not be dressed appropriate ?   
Enjoy the clip , as i have a feeling it will be offline soon.
		 
			
			I'm both shocked and disgusted. My life will never be the same again...
		               
While I don't think it is quite a situation of ""much ado about nothing""... the dress IS a bit more revealing than typical for Sesame Street after all, I think the flap has caused it to be seen by more children than would have actually watched it on Sesame Street in the first place.   
Aside from that though... my hubby sure likes it.    I think the problem isn't even necessarily simply the dress and cleavage but rather the Baywatch-esque running in said low-cut dress.  (**catty**As ""Baywatch"" as Katy's B+ can be anyhow **catty**)

			I don't know if there are any Agatha Christie fans, but one of my favourite books since my adolescence was  . It's been made into several films, most with the title  . (I think the 1965 version may have been filmed in Switzerland.) In my opinion, all of these version have been ruined by an unwillingness to use the original ending in the book. However, in 1987 Stanislav Govorukhin filmed a version that is remarkably faithful to the book. It's a great film, but if you get the DVD the English subtitles are HORRIBLE. If you know the book, you can correctly guess the dialogue, but it's still a huge distraction.   
Anyway, somebody finally wrote English subtitles that make sense and you can see the whole thing on YouTube. If you like this part, you can see the rest on-line:

			Time Travel ?   
A Belfast film-maker has posted a video on the internet showing what he says could be evidence of time travelling. 
George Clarke from east Belfast has been puzzled for more than a year by a scene in a film which appears to show a woman talking on a mobile phone.  
The unusual thing is that the movie was made by Charlie Chaplin in 1928 - long before mobile phones were invented.                    
Why would she have a mobile phone if she was deaf ???             ...and long before the mobile network that phone uses was invented.
		     
If she travelled in time, I think whenever she came from in the future would have something better than GSM, sub-space communicators :-)
		    sighh...

			With all due respect to Adam Sandler, this is THE [American] Thanksgiving song. I hope you like it!       
			
			So this is what Thanksgiving is all about- the pilgrims were feeling socialism, this is the ideal that the US was built on, no mention of the Native Americans.

Crows are vicious bar stewards. Once my cat playfully chased one as it was wandering around on the sun terrace. Within a couple of minutes there were about 5 of them circling overhead, squawking at the top of their lungs and swooping dangerously low. Had I not scooped him up and taken him indoors I'm sure he would have been attacked.

			WiFi signals made visible           DP, that was like...er...yeah man, far out dude.  .  The accompanying ""music"" alone was enough to put me off.  Almost went cross-eyed with all the white light laser imagery.               I have to admit that the 'music' is a bit way-out.  You can watch it with the mute on.  The 'techie' side of it is quite fun. I find that kind of art fascinating.        Like so many Dads at wedding receptions etc. after a few drinks        Forgot about the mute option ( ) but then the music did fit the subject matter.  From a techie-artistic viewpoint, it's interesting I agree.         The only time I ever go cross-eyed when watching videos on the Internet is when... No. Let's not go there.
		    I guess you're not talking about   videos ?        is coming around again soon in the UK. This is from the stage show in 1986, before it became a regular televised event.   
At that time all the performers were comedians and known celebrities, not newsreaders and the like.  This is one of my favourites, not only because it features Kate Bush.           The mind boggles!         A classic. Thanks.  Loved it.  Am a Kate Bush fan too.    
As Google is everyone's friend I will check and see what she's up to these days.  I feel another all our yesterdays music download session coming on very soon...
		 
			
			Quite a funny one          Nothing since her album 'Aerial' in 2005.  There are rumours of something later this year.  She only produces something if the mood takes her, rather than responding to commercial pressure.
		    Thanks DP    
Good for Ms Bush on not allowing commercial pressures to dictate her output as this can be a creativity killer.  Then again, not all artistes have that luxury of being able to wait until what they ""feel"" is the right time for them to produce.

		    I had given my tickets a way at the Globe London, so was waiting for those I had given the tickets to in the lobby area, when Rowan Atkinson walked in, obviously in a hurry. I asked him for his autograph. He, said ""Certainly!"" then he asked if I had a pen or something to write on, I said ""No"", he did a quick search, then said ""neither do I"". I asked him to wait, he waited until I got a pen from the booking office- he was so polite and patient!

			The Lamborghini Gallardo L140 luxury sports car - worth the equivalent of £465,000 in China - had recurring problems after the owner purchased it in October last year, it was claimed, But far from fixing the problem, the dealership managed to mess up the bumper and chassis when it was in their care, according to reports in China. So the Chinese entrepreneur decided to pummel his pride and joy on World Consumer Rights Day by hiring a group of workers, giving them sledgehammers and letting them do the rest.       
I'm sure it'll T-cut out       Pfft, watched the first bit and none of them are really putting their backs into it! Give a bunch of Aussies sledgehammers, and that car would've been destroyed before the beer got warm ...

What would the Swiss think ?        
First of all, I hope it was understood, that it was a joke idea, I have no intentions of following through. As lame as the dance is, I do not possess the skills nor the confidence to present it.   
Although, if it was done, I don't see how any random Swiss wouldn't break out into hysterical laughter, if not, the Swiss truely have no sense of humour.

It reminded me of this nice video about Zurich. With most of the places featured in it, I carry memories, and I'm glad someone made the effort to create this vid. Not being in Zurich anymore, it makes me pretty nostalgic too.   
I hope you enjoy it as well!

			I'm from the North of England, Lancashire to be precise. 
Here goes...               
My claim to fame - I went to the same school as Victoria Wood.       Nice thread Nil... I'm a bit of a sucker for the Celine Dion (specially the French songs)    
The other by Omar Faruk is great, didn't know who he is, but it's got all the good oriental beats and sounds. Good start to the week

			Why was Nil's thread about music representing your culture merged with this pretty much any-Youtube-will-do thread?
		    They're of equal value as YouTube clips.
		    But the threads served completely different purposes.
		    Ok so since bananas and apples are both fruits, it must taste the same thing, right?    
My thread is to share your culture by music, which can come in form of mp3, videos (YouTube or google videos or name it)   
If I wanted to share youtubes of the day, I would have post them here, I wanted to create a cultural experience shared between EF members through music.
		    Two similar threads have been merged. The content is still there. /dramathx      Bananas are not fruit.
		    Seriously, that's the best you can come up with?
		    No, but it's all I can be bothered about in the face of teh drama.

A handcuffed man who managed to steal the Texas police car he was being transported in has been re-caught and arrested. 
         Darren Douglas Porter was originally arrested for attempting to break into an antique shop.  
         He escaped on Friday and was at large for several days but is now in custody. 
         The incident was caught on camera by a nearby police car.

My cousin used to have a collie sized dog who was known for chasing any cat in the neighbourhood foolish enough to wander into his garden.  But when they went to visit his parents the dog would be cowering under a chair, afraid of the parents' cat.  Used to have to put the cat outside when it was time for them to go home because the dog wouldn't come out from under the chair while the cat was in the house.

		    Two Russians just shipped my second car across the US, through blizzards, and icy passes, they do a great job. The first time I met them they turned up during an historic snowstorm and as they were checking the car told me a joke in heavy accents-""What does the border guard say to two men he finds have a dead body and  (then he reeled off a list of weaponry I didn't recognize) in the trunk?""  I said "" I don't know""  they answered ""He says have a nice day!""  and left.  I'd just given them my car, full payment cashier's check and left my full length beaver coat on the back seat.  Both cars were delivered as they left and the second time they reminded me that I hang onto the cash until they deliver.

			I'm sure most of you have seen the sketch where two Scots are trapped in an elevator (or lift) with voice recognition technology that won't recognize their Scottish accents. Now there's a Chinese version. This poor guy is trying to use On-Star to dial a number while he is driving. You don't need to be able to read the Chinese subtitles to understand what's going on.   
(In case you're wondering, there are Chinese subtitles on this clip for the same reason Germany puts German subtitles on Swiss films.)          I'm assuming that was shot by a Swiss soldier. It's a fun video and I hope he didn't get reprimanded for it. Great acting from the other members of his unit.

Just for background, the bride used to sit next to me at work and is one of those rare people who is as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside... She does a lot of charity work but also has a really dry, wicked sense of humour, so to see her cry happy tears at this surprise always makes me cry too.    Her brother posted this dance on youtube with the sole intention of making it available to their family members in NYC and Dubai, but it got picked up by a U.S. tv programme and had over a million hits within a few weeks.

Can't wait to see this band for the 10th time this summer.          I guess that's what happened to it.
		 
			
			I ended up in the strange part of the internet again.           Hardly. Radiohead broke new ground and really made a fantastic, positive impact on music -- and they did all that nearly 25 years ago. But they aren't ""what happened to the music industry"". They're more the poster children for the music anti-industry, despite their commercial success.   
""What happened to the music industry"" is exemplified by       
and       
and       
and even       
(I'm really sorry for that last one.)   
Pretty, aren't they? It's all about the director now. And how many naughty words they can throw in. Sad, really.

			I am trying to find out where I could go to listen live music (guitar, drums, etc.) I am not considering concerts.   
Thanks
		 
			
			Bars with live music are a bit few and far between to be honest. For geetar stuff i'd recommend El Lokal or Hafenkneipe. 
I'd be very intersted to hear of more places of their ilk.   
Otherwise there are a few smaller concert venues which are pretty good for seeing live acts:   
Abart 
Kaufleuten (there's 2 smaller rooms which are good). 
Volkshaus 
Dynamo 
Rote Fabrik   
I'm going to see The Do at Mascotte on Sunday. It's more of a club so I don't know what it'll be like for live stuff.   
p.s Avoid the ubiquitous Sasunnach Rat Club. The bouncers are a bunch of officious morons.
		 
			
			Sorry, but I only know of concerts.  
You can find venues on zuertipp.ch or ronorp.net   
Tested and recommended: 
Abart (Which will close down soon)   
Heard of: 
Maaghalle, Helsinki   
Zurich West: 
Chollerhalle (If you consider going to Zug) 
  Bierhuebeli (If you consider going to Bern)

			Just a heads-up that Steel Panther will be playing the Plaza on March 24 as part of their European tour.   
If you like your hair metal, great tunes and a large dose of profane and ironic hilariousness thrown in, this is your band.    
I saw them most recently support Def Leppard and Motley Crue in London and they stole the show.           
			
			I cannot see any announcement on the Plaza website. Is this gig definitely taking place?
		 
			
			Gig is taking place in komplex, Hohlstrasse 457 in Zürich
		 
			
			Suzy's right. They changed the venue from the Plaza to Komplex a couple of weeks back. I bought some more tickets for friends the other week and it's still taking place.

			Snow Patrol are playing in Basel on March 5th 2012 at St Jakobshalle.  Tickets on sale now:       
I believe it is standing/unreserved so if anyone else is going and wants to meet up let me know.
		 
			
			They are also playing at the NRJ Stars For Free concert in Zurich at the Hallenstadion on 25 November...(if you can stand the hordes of screaming teenagers  )
		 
			
			If you get your tickets from   they cost 65 francs instead of Ticketcorner's CHF 69.50, plus you can print your tickets at home so you don't have to pay Ticketcorner's additional (ridiculous) CHF 9.80 shipping charge ....
		    Thanks for the info - saved me a bit of cash.    
Does anyone know how many people fit in the arena? Saw it officially holds around 9,000 but I just wondered if this the same for a concert.   
I will only get there quite late and don't want to stand at the back without any view!!
		 
			
			thanks for the heads up on the gig. i will definatley try to get some tiks. the star ticket looks the best option
		 
			
			Help! I was going to book tickets a couple of days ago but didn't, now I can't book any. Has anyone got 2 spare tickets they are willing to sell?      No way!!!   
I got 2 of the last 20    
			
			I have also just seen 2 tickets for sale on their Facebook site.

			Mine are sold now. Sorry for the late reply.
		 
			
			For those of you who didn't manage to get tickets for this, Snow Patrol have just confirmed they're to be main act at this year's   near Bern, mid July. Yippeee.   
So if Monday's gig is going to be as good as expected, then I'll be going there too.    
			
			If they are available i will have them. I guess i should ask you to PM me, whatever that means.

			Well, its got to be said again -   IS part of the royalty of real jazz festivals in Europe.   
This is not Montreux Jazz festival's little cousin; this is   on the Lac Leman.   
Cully Jazz Fest still has a heart and soul and vibe, unlike, IMHO, its bigger cousin/cousine east of it on the lake.   
Check out the program. Absolutely outstanding.   
This Jazz festival is going from strength to strength, year by year.       
And probably on the finest location of Lake Geneva too.   
Plenty of ""Off"" gigs in about 12-ish wine caves dotted around the wine village, besides the more head line gigs by some real jazz monsters.

			For more than thirty years Anne Clark has held a unique place in contemporary music.   
  Combining literary, socially engaged texts with innovative and  genre-breaking music, she has covered every kind of style, while at the  same time maintaining her own identity on each and every recording,  whether it be the samples (before sampling became a concept) and  electronically treated acoustics of The Sitting Room (1982), to the  ground-breaking analogue synth classics of Sleeper In Metropolis (1983) and Our Darkness (1984).   
  In 2011 Anne Clark and her long time pianist Murat Parkal contributed  an arrangement of the Charles Baudelaire poem Enivrez-Vous (Be Drunk) to  the audio book and radio play Die Künstlichen Paradiese, (Hörbuch  Hamburg/Radio Bremen). The project was further developed into a “live”  concept with a performance at the Volksbühne in Berlin.    
 After  public and critical acclaim the “duo” are now taking the project  further, collaborating with LordMasters artists collective in Zurich.   
  LordMasters is an independent collective of artists and performers who  have stepped out of the main stream to follow their own personal path,  and whose artistry comes from a keen observation of the world.   Consisting of artists coming from all parts of the world, dance, music,  film, visual arts or literature, each medium is an equally important  part of a more global work.    
  After responding to the worlds  system overload, the constant bombardment of information and societies  over consumption of everything… “Enough” is an intimate concert  stripping back to the raw elements of music, words and movement.

			Well here goes....    
For chitter and chatter about gigs up and coming to run along side the wonderfully implemented calendar events and for the numpty simpletons like me who prefer the old fashioned way      
hopefully this will replace Jot's great 'Zurich Gig Guide' from the past - but will please all the unfortunate bumpkins that live outside the canton of Zurich    
			
			Why is it that some people have so much difficulty dealing with change?   
IMO This thread is pointless and selfish.
		 
			
			I was sure I was going to get groans for that and they will all be from people living in or around Zürich...   
When in real life a small group of people sharing the same interests (for example Zürich inhabitants, blondes, Audi TT owners, whatever...) joins up with a bigger group (for example Switzerland inhabitants, ladies who like to dye their hair, Audi owners...), you can then tell them a 1000 times that it doesn't make sense them staying together in their small group, that they should open up to the other people...If they don't want to change they won't.
		    well then go to this   instead? we cater for all    
			
			Primal Scream Xtra 16 th August.
		    Are you going Annie and Nicky? We may have to re-arrange my schedule a bit so we can go because they are good live.
		 
			
			We are Nigel, booked our tickets today.
		    Not sure yet - not listened to any of their recent stuff
		 
			
			The latest album is really good. Check out the website    
We now have tickets as well.       
I am also wondering about the Delilahs at Kaufleuten on 13th August.
		    Don't you think that there are Primal Scream fans living outside of Zurich?
		    Primal Scream are playing in Zurich therefore it is a 'Zurich Gig' - I created another thread to post gigs in Switzerland should anyone wish to....
		    Grrr.... 
Zurich is in Switzerland.
		    Why don't we have ""Yawn"" button as well as Thanks & Groan?
		 
			
			Well you all found this thread about Primal Scream playing in Zurich so whats the fuss.      PS I dont live in Zurich Kanton.      I found it because I actually live in Zurich and am registered to this thread.   
But why should a Primal Scream fan who does not live in Zurich have to wade through 10 pages of Zurich concerts to discover that his favourite band is going to play in Switzerland?   
If you want to keep this thread fair enough but please also add the events to the Concerts Calendar!
		    Who let you in? Anyways, this thread is far more pointless and selfish, it's only for Zurich Stadt       True but we should also have a ""This poster is being selfish"" button that would be worth 10 groans.
		    Why register to something that seems to cause you so much angst    
Anyone only using this ""Heads Up"" thread or the EF concert guide is going to miss out on plenty of things they might like anyway. It contains a mere fraction of what is going on. Compare it to a comprehensive gig guide eg   ,   etc   
Real gig guides exists elsewhere, so I certainly can't be bothered replicating them on EF. Call me selfish if you must, but it only caters for those who like to be.....       
			
			We have the Concert Calendar, we also have the Zurich Gig Guide thread and the Switzerland Gig Guide thread - is this not enough?    
Martin if you want to add Primal Scream into the calendar then go ahead - Mannie Organ decided to post it here and that is entirely her choice but it does not stop you creating an event   
After the demise of the Zurich gig guide some people (me included) missed having a general thread to chat about and mention up and coming gigs.   
I am sure people living elsewhere can still look at at this thread if they see a new post added to it - especially if they are interested in music and are willing to travel - if someone decided to create a Basel Gig Guide I would follow it, just because i Live in Zurich doesn't mean i wouldn't be interested in gigs in other cities   
where's the flogging a dead horse icon for this bleedin topic......
		 
			
			Martin - you groaned Mannie Organ for merely posting a gig that is happening in Zurich in the Zurich Gigs ""heads Up"" thread, do you really believe that deserves a groan? as far as she is aware she is posting in the right place... really some people.....
		    The difference between the EF concerts calendar and a general events website is that the concerts mentioned on here are focused towards the expat community.    
According to your reasoning if information that was already available on the Internet should not be added to the EF then there wouldn't be much content on the EF.   
What I don't understand is why you can't create a Primal Scream Concert thread on the calendar for the 16th August and then have your discussion there: ""Are you going?"", ""No I am going on holiday"", ""Pity because Primal Scream are good"" etc... ?
		    Go for it Martin, very happy for you to go and post the event in the calendar, jeeze I'll do it if it will make you happy?
		    No I groaned at her because she knows of a good concert that could interest other expats but decided not to add it to the Calendar.
		    everytime this thread gets bumped to the top, i think there's a new concert...       I posted it in the Zurich thread because the bloody concert is in Zurich,end of story.          Most of the gigs I go to are with Swiss people. They have remarkably the same taste in music as ""expats"". EF is intended to be a ""Community portal for English-speaking people in Switzerland"", not an expat ghetto.      People do often refer to outside web sources. The real value of EF is in the info that isn't so easy to find, and peoples experience and opinions.      I've not been overwhelmed by the volume of your contributions to this calendar (was it zero or nil?). It's a bit rich to be handing out tit-for-tat groans to contributors and using that as an excuse.
		    That is the whole point of my groan. If you post your comments and information somewhere in the middle of a gigantic Zurich Concerts thread it will not be easy to find.
		     gigantic one and a bit pages.
		    Exactly the problem, and not exactly unexpected.  That is why I wonder why there are mutliple gig threads.  It serves no purpose other than to keep those in Zurich happy and the rest of the board uninformed.
		 
			
			I give up.      see everyone uses things differently, I prefer this way rather than the concerts calendar, the gig is posted and then if no one adds a comment to that event then it gets lost in the pile - whereas I see a new gig added to this and it appears in 'new posts', if i decide i want to go to the event mentioned I put it in my own calendar, I find this solution easier, however i appreciate that you don't, we can't please everyone and I think it will just have to be give and take   
If in the future you see a gig mentioned on this or the other thread and you want to create an event in the concerts calendar then go ahead but don't groan at people if they have chosen this method if that's what THEY prefer   
Nicky
		    For the moment but by August it would theoretically be longer.
		    It's a conspiracy for sure.

		    And why not post it to the general concerts thread?  Do you specificaly not want others to know about it?  Or do you feel too many concerts go on in the rest of the country that it would be lost?
		    Cyrus I didn't post it in here but I actually advised Mannie Organ to post it in here so yes slapped wrist - but it is actually a Zurich concert, not exclusive to Zurichers but it is happening in Zurich - the thread exists and it seemed a suitable place   
I think you are being a bit pedantic over this... is it really all that important? a gig is happening in Zurich and it was posted in the Zurich Gigs 'Heads Up' thread       It is pedantic, but it's not just me being pedantic is it?  I just feel everyone is better of with a general concert thread, but those from Zurich can't seem to post their concerts to a thread that doesn't have the word ""Zurich"" in it.
		    I think 'those' from Zurich can (if they want) Mannie Organ isn't even bloody from Zurich she posted it here because the event is IN Zurich, quite a logical decision do you not think, when confronted with 2 threads, one called Switzerland Gig Guide and the other Zurich Gigs ""heads up""    
Basically don't blame the messenger, it's the mods decision what to do with the two threads and so far they have been left as they are, so...... a user comes along and posts a zurich gig in the zurich gig thread and she gets groaned and hassled about it       
			
			Ok, to summarise:   
There was a Zurich Concerts thread, people weren't happy and made a General concerts thread. Then people weren't happy because gigs in their area were getting lost in the big General concerts thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... People still weren't happy so there was a Concerts forum created.    
People still weren't happy because they could only discuss a particular concert in a thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... then the non Zurich people got pissed off...     
FFS people, no one is going to be happy all the time. Its not the end of the world, get off your high horses (Did Hsiang ever find out where to procure one?) and go to whatever concerts you want to. If a gig is in Zurich why can't the people that live in Zurich discuss it in a Zurich based thread. If they were going to go to a gig in Luzern I'm sure they wouldn't object to it being in a Luzern gigs thread.    
I think a certain amount of ""cop the f**K on"" is needed here.
		    Actually the old Zurich concert threads served well for all concerts in the country, because most concerts happen in Zurich, there were no other threads.  I thought a title change would be appropriate to reflect the actual content of the thread, but obviously, that was just too much.
		    Well then you should have left well enough alone and not tried to fix what was not broken.       But why on earth do you guys have to have these general threads why not simply create an individual thread for each concert and discuss the specifics there.   
That was Nathu's aim when he created the Concerts calendar.   
This reminds of procedural language programmers who couldn't understand object-oriented programming: Now every concert is one object.
		    Because maybe they don't want to!   
You are still perfectly entitled to post the concert in the concerts thread should you so desire.
		 
			
			It's annoying me now how I bang on about it, I understand how some people prefer a single thread and some like the events, but I simply cannot understand why we have 2 seperate stickies simply confusing the issue.     
All gigs posted here will be in Switzerland, most will be in Zurich, why is it so hard to not have a single thread with a title that accurately reflects the contents ""Upcoming Concerts"" or some such, then acts will be picked up by all who might not otherwise consider a trip out of town.  Instead we have 2 threads, or one thread with an inaccurate title.
		 
			
			Now that 50% of the dissenters have annoyed themselves, can we move to the next part of this thread cycle please?   
Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism -> thread users discuss thread -> long period of silence -> thread users think it safe -> Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism ->
		 
			
			Er, I support the use of the Concerts Calendar - which should be merged with the main calendar IMO; let's have a huge 'What's On' section with overview - rather than having lots of different threads.   
There was some arcane rule about not posting an event on the calendar if you weren't intending to attend; surely that's not necessary? Should there be a concert, is it not easier to have it on the calendar? One concert has no relevence to any other and threads like this spin outta control... although something is better than nothing.   
And it's Zürchers, not Zürichers       Oh yes, above it all aren't we? but can't possibly post to a concerts thread without Zurich being in the title.
		 
			
			right i have to dash off to catch a flight very shortly but as an interim would it make everyone happy if I merge this thread with the Switzerland Gig Guide thread and just have the one thread from now on    
The Zurich guide i really don't think was created intentionally to p!ss off Cyrus and Martin but it seems to have done anyway and I think they'll be banging on about it until the cows come home, so I'll merge and we'll just have one generic thread - which will eliminate their the 'them and us' belief   
Agreed?
		 
			
			Right threads merged - it's all a bit of a jumble - i will attempt to edit it when i get chance
		 
			
			I was going to post earlier, but it felt a little childish   
For fans of electro pop, the excellent   are coming to CH   
Stall 6, Zurich, 2/6 and 
Volkshaus, Basel on 3/6
		    Can I now be picky and ask for it to be renamed ""Switzerland Gigs ""Heads Up"" or ""Switzerland Gigs Discussion"" or ""Switzerland Rough Gig Guide""? Cos it aint a gig guide.
		    ah it could have gone in the other thread    
			
			eskimo joe(super aussie band) are playing Bier Huebli in Bern on the 27th October.             
I'm going. anyone from Zurich feel like grabbing a train to Bern check them out?   
(to avoid a sh!t fight based re: the usual argument: Zurich vs rest of the known universe, if someone feels like popping this on the gig-calendar please feel free. i don't know how. :-) )   
they will also be at Gurten for those who are going   
cheers

			thanks UM.

			Heard a rumour the amazing Not The Sensational Alex Harvey Band will play in ETH StuZ this September. Not to be missed!
		 
			
			MUSE playing the Hallenstadion in Zurich - Nov 18th... 
Tickets on sale as of today       You've made my day!
		 
			
			B*llocks only seating left!!
		 
			
			Yeah, I think that its because you were only allowed to buy the tickets when they were released if you were a VIP member of ticketcorner.com. Totally sucks as now all the 'ticket dregs' are left. Anyhow, I managed to buy 2 tickets for the UK so will be seeing them there.    
			
			Someone wants to come?           
Thats gonna be my first concert here! Great start    
			
			I wouldn't mind going to see Gossip tonight at Kaufleuten, but they sold out at starticket, does anyone know if they sell tickets on the door?   
I don't want to travel all the way to Zurich and find I can't get in.
		 
			
			A bit short notice but, tonight I can completely recommend both of the bands that will be playing in the restaurant, if it rains, or just outside on the terrace if it doesn't, at the Rote Fabrik. The bands are, in no particular order, Sein and Attwenga. 
Thankyou for your time.

			Wilco play the Volkshaus on November 11th, tickets from CHF55.-   
Peaches plays 8th September, from CHF55.-   
Goran Bregovic also plays there 23rd April, 2010 ( ) from CHF65.-
		    play the Club at the Theater Spektakel in Zürich Tuesday 18th August, bringing some spooky Ethiopean jazz grooves to the shores of the lake of Zurich. If you weren't in Addis Ababa before 1974, you'll know their music from the Jim Jarmusch film 'Broken Flowers'    
Fire        
			
			This used to work much better when it was a single thread called Zurich Gig Guide 2009 in social events.                      play the Mascotte in Zurich again on December 5th. They're also supporting Muse at the Hallenstadion on November 18th. A good show       It doesn't work because you aren't using the system correctly.
		 
			
			Martin he is using the system how he would like to use it - please quit with groans because someone disagrees with you.   
There are many who no longer benefit from the new system me included - I know a lot of time and effort went into creating the concerts calendar but i feel it is not as effective as the handy gig guide thread we had before. I am finding out about less gigs now because people are just not posting them. It's quick and easy to post on here and many people are short of time and don't wish to create an event.   
So please, we know you don't like this method, but we don't like the other method so can we be grown up and not groan the users who would like to carry on down this route?   
Bannahead thanks for those 3 updates - I am sure in the old system these would have been announced sooner so I hope there are still tickets left for Temper Trap   
Cheers  
Nicky
		    ...It's not that we don't wish to creat an event, but we're following previous rules asking us not to create events if we don't intend / sure if we're going. This is a ""Heads Up"" thread.   
On that note, the rather loud and rocking  play the Rote Fabrik this coming Sunday 20th. Last time they played there were about 7 people in the Ziegel; one was a waiter, one at the bar, two groupies and me and my two mates   A private party!    
There're really quite good, despite the crowds...
		    I agree UM this is why i don't use this calendar event because a) I am unsociable and don't want a crowd tagging along with me at a gig   and b) sometimes I find out about a gig want to tell others but may not be going myself   
I just don't want to get into the whole gigs head up guide v concerts calendar debate again - there was no happy outcome the last time so why can't each person just do as they wish and post a gig ho they want?    
I like this method and it worked for many years and was updated regularly - at least 2 to 3 times a week a new gig would be posted on here and it was always my most favourote thread, it's now died a death and it's a shame    
			
			I haven't posted because I haven't seen anything I liked, it's been quiet over summer.   
Here's a couple to get the thread started again.   
25.10 Micachu and the Shapes / The Invisibles, Zukunft, Zurich   
12.11 Passion Pit, Alte Borse, Zurich   
20.11 The Field, Palace, St. Gallen   
25.11 Massive Attack, Eishalle Deutweg Winterthur   
3.12 Punks Jump Up, Hive, Zurich   
5.12 The Heavy, Palace, St. Gallen
		 
			
			Massive Attack, even antisocial me might be interested in that.       And where do I fit in to that description? I'm still fearful of crossing paths with the FOTL boys after the death look they gave me for buying a bottle of wine at the counter, it was for DaveA I tells ya! Don't think we'll see the likes of a FOTL & Black Mountain ""restaurant"" gig again soon   
Anyways here is my heads up, El Lokal to the rescue in October with varying shades of classy Americana in one hell of a week:   
Oct 18 - Mark Eitzel (American Music Club) 
Oct 22 - Joseph Arthur (last time I saw him was supporting R.E.M.) 
Oct 25 - Richmond Fontaine (Uncut Magazine's favourite story tellers)
		    Oh boy oh boy, Good work, El Lokal       Palace in St Gallen is a very good venue. Dont be scared to stand in front of the ""seat"" people though.        This is your opinion. And you are wrong.   
Along with Nicky, I do not want to reopen the whole Zurich Gig Guide versus Calendar discussion because it got boring very quickly. However, I will not be posting any events         
Sadly I won't be able to attend The XX gig and I am mightily disappointed.
		     
I like the recent albums but I'm not sure how it will work live.
		 
			
			Camera Obscura - 13th Oct - Abart, Zurich   
White Lies - 14th Nov - Kaufleuten, Zurich
		 
			
			Someone here on EF is nutty for them if remember correctly....   
Ultravox - Volkshaus Zurich - 15 April 2010   
with Midge Ure back up front.
		 
			
			It's a good week for indie music in Zürich with Au Revoir Simone on Tuesday and Yacht last night (which was great!).   
This evening Girls are playing at Exil.   
They have an interesting personal history, having grown up in the Children of God cult, being heavily involved with drugs and being adopted by a billionaire . . . or something.   
The music is psychedelic, influenced by the Beach Boys and shoegaze.
		 
			
			Who are the ""Girls"" ?     
as you can imagine, googling is pointless ... what do I google? Girls in Zurich, Girls group, Girls music ...
		 
			
			Anyone interested in seeing Alice In Chains in Fribourg start of december?   
A bit of a different band from their Grunge days, could be interesting
		    Well I did explain a little bit in my original post . . .   
More here:          If only I noticed earlier      
The debut album - imaginatively titled Album - is in the post   
Did you go? Were they good?       
And now for a plug          Unfortunately they started at 11.30 which was a bit late for a school night, so I decided against it.   
In other news . . . Patrick Wolf is playing at Mascotte on Wednesday. Anyone going? Or want to go? If you are it would be nice to meet up . . . PM me.       
			
			FYI - for any Aussies out there Eskimo Joe is playing tonight in Bern at the Bier Huebli           
cheers

			It would seem that The Joy Formidable are supporting The Temper Trap.   
Check out the video here      
How can you not love this band.
		 
			
			for the U2 fans out there, heard that they'll be playing in zurich next summer... can anyone confirm?
		   I'm looking forward to see KING AUTOMATIC at the longstreet bar 4.11.09 @2100h
Now that is something worth going to see..       I watched their video, what a bunch of w@nkers!
		    Not definitively but I can say the stage diagrams /architect plans have been drawn up (see  ), permission for a concert at Dubendorf Airfield has been granted, and I would expect a concert date sometime in the first half of September 2010 to be announced in the next week or two.
		 
			
			...are playing at the Volkhaus on 28.01.10...(I know I know, that's ages away, but being in CH...)   
I think tickets are around CHF50 , but you'll get excellent riffage for your frank, and the support is sure to be good....       
You know it makes sense!
		 
			
			Looking forward to the Temper trap in a few weeks. Got a few mates coming. Anyone interested in meeting up, PM me
		 
			
			Ian Brown is playing at Abart in Zurich on the 18th January. Tickets are now available.   
Should be a great gig if he manages to keep out of trouble with the dibble between now and then.
		 
			
			I just hope that he doesn't get bottled like  the last time he played Rohstofflager.   
Ian went offstage for a break, the roadies were switching out the Fender guitars and bringing the Gretsches onstage. This suggests the likelihood of an encore filled with Stone Roses songs. He wasn't offstage for more than 3 minutes and the idiots behind started throwing filled cups of beer towards the stage, coating us in the front row and the instruments on stage. They were asked to stop, but the continued. The lights came on the, the roadies got all the gear off stage and the Ian didn't come back on to play an encore that would have included a bunch of Roses tracks   , (as indicated on the setlist i collected)   
I really hope the Abart crowd are a bit more sensible.               is playing at the Salzhaus in Winterthur on Sunday, 22 Nov 2009   
And me sadly up in Germany...
		 
			
			The Living End - Aussie pub rock   
Monday 23 Nov Abart Zurich.   
Any interest?             
			
			Scout Niblett's at Abart on at Exil on December 3rd.   
Dinosaur Egg!
		    will be there with the missus and some mates   
went to high school with these guys       At Abart or Exil?   Put the gin bottle down, man.
		    Naughty Hendricks!   
It'sh Exil . . .       
			
			for those going to Temper Trap on the 2nd Dec - the venue has been changed to the Abart
		 
			
			Living End - what a gig man!!!    
AWESOME !!
		    YEA - it was an amazing show!!! And I liked how the venue was really stretched to it's limit, with a crowd surfer almost kicking down a ceiling-mounted stage light and with the bass literally lifting the roof      
best CHF36 I ever spent in Switzerland    
			
			A great venue for a great Band:   
Stereophonics.  
09.02.2010.  
Palais Xtra. ZH
		 
			
			The Temper Trap is playing at Abart Zurich on 2nd. December. 
Is anyone going as well?
		 
			
			Wow just listened to some Youtube vids (Science of Fear, Sweet Disposition and Fader) and they are pretty damn awesome, in fact very awesome, I really like the sound.   
Abart is 50m from my apartment too. Very tempted, will talk to my friend and look at tickets tommorrow. Thanks for the heads-up man.    
			
			You're welcome. Love Abart as it's a smaller venue AND it has a Bar    
			
			got the tickets as soon as i saw they are in CH. really looking forward to seeing them..
		 
			
			Also already secured my tickets for Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten on 22. February. He's amazing live and it will sell-out really fast. Just to give everyone the head's up.      Same here. Should be rad.    
And yep Xaiver Rudd is a go-a in December. Will bet tickets asap
		 
			
			I'll be there at Temper trap - looking forward to it - shame they changed the venue though
		    Thanks for the heads up...I would've turned up at hafenkneipe blissfully unaware that they had changed the venue otherwise. Oh well, bang goes my 3 minute walk...   
Should be an awesome gig though, can't wait to see them live.
		    ...and bang it goes to Richdog. Abarte is at the end of my street.    
Really looking forward to the gig, booking tickets tommorrow.       But Xavier Rudd is in February next year not December?
		 
			
			oops my bad. May miss it cause i'll be in Australia either feb or march
		 
			
			Biffy Clyro is playing at Mascotte in Zurich this Saturday. 
Also for those who have missed it, Editors are playing at X-tra in Zurich with support by the Maccabees! Should be a great gig.
		    Its annoying that one,we are booked for the editors,but would have really liked to see Biffy Clyro.
		 
			
			Same here. Difficult choices      me too - they supported Muse but really we were so far away and as usual the sound is rubbish in Hallenstadion and especially for the support acts. Would have been good to see them in a smaller venue   
see you Sat Mrs O
		 
			
			see you in the bar.
		 
			
			Just seen Filastine is playing at exil in Zurich tomorrow (Friday).  Think that might be mighty interesting.
		     
4th February   at abart   
10th March   at rohstofflager
		    She must have liked it here last time!
		 
			
			David Grey for anyone interested

		    Cool i might be keen for that
		 
			
			Gentleman & the Evolution are playing at Maag Event Hall in Zurich on 20th April 2010. Bit far off but tickets will sell fast.

			Jase you just made my day!   
I love John Butler Trio, saw them live at Gurten Festival.  
Will get my tickets asap     
Another heads up:   
RJD2 is playing in Bern in May.       
			
			12 March, Zurich, Volkshaus -    bringing his upcoming   work.   
Brothers and sisters in true music, this gig is a keeper of keepers.  I have heard some tasters from the CD, read reviews from in the know people who I trust with their musical opinions, and it promises to be a deep human  , esp. in these obtuse times on the planet earth.  And believe me I have seen Pat Metheny many times (more than any other artist perhaps including Joe Zawinul in the same company) since 1978, so this is full-hearted endorsement.   
If you saw   tour of 1992, and   in 2005, then this tour has the potential to outpass these two extra dimensional gigs.  Metheny is a musician/composer/human being for our times and for all times.   
Here's a neat interview with Metheny       Is RJD2 playing his low tech hip hop stuff (ie. since we last spoke/Dead ringer) or his indie singer-songwriter stuff? cause im not so found of his new direction.   
Edit: Also keen to check out DJ Vadim on Feb 5th if anyones going

Would love to see her... too bad that it's so far and on a Tuesday       will take place from the 7th to the 10th of April in Crans Montana (Valais).   
The program is available here:       
I've never been so far but I might go there on the Friday evening.   and   should be interesting.       I love air but not sure how much tickets are. I thought theyd be expensive because they're crazy popular in Australia
		 
			
			Btw: Does anyone know where I can get tickets to the Stall6 gigs? Im trying to find DJ Vadim tickets online but it seems to be the biggest run around

			The Blood Arm are playing in Albani Club, Winterthur on 23rd Feb and Bar 59, Luzern 24th. I have seen this band twice in London, and they put on the most entertaining shows of any band I have ever seen.    
Go see them!   
(And if anybody is going to be driving to either one from the Grindelwald area, please let me know...)       Great!!! I'll be there...  Tickets available at:    
(40chf  )
		    Bar 59 is a cool little spot, might go check them out.     
La Roux is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, on the 7th March.
		    Damn, apparently it's sold out.  Anyone want rid of their tickets?
		    Do Kaufleuten normally have additional tickets on the door?
		    Don't know, but would like to find out.

Hockey 16 Feb 10 Abart     
Vampire Weekend, May 28 2008   Zurich <-- so errr ignore that, as it's way out of date (Thanks bananahead for spotting!)
		     
Hey Kirsty, you do realise that it is 2010 this year?                 
But they were good    
			
			hmm thanks for pointing out my stupidity... but I would have liked to go! This was my vain search for bands I really like playing in Switzerland, and I turned up... 2   And one of those was 2 years ago! (It said past performances in teeny tiny writing - you can't blame me for getting over excited and missing that!)   
Harumph, so just hockey then...
		     
Hi there, 
You can buy them in Ticket corner,  they are 60.60 CHF general entrance, 
it is not that expensive. 
Are you going? 
Alex
		    The missus might be sorting tickets atm. Will let you know if we are
		    Hockey is ausverkauf.   
I'm not sure if they will have tickets on the door at Abart.

I thought he went by the name of Senanda Maitreye these days?   
P.S to save others searching the D Club location as I just did   it's in Lausanne
		 
			
			As a heads up, we actually have a concerts calendar as an option on the main forum calendar. It's somewhat lost because one has to scroll down and change the options to see it - we're working on simplifying this - but  anyway. As these lists get longer and longer, perhaps it'd be useful for others to know from the calendar if you're intending to go. It'll allow a bit of buzz for the event and let others know who's attending.
		     
Nicky, he sure has but thought to put his former name out to those who remember him from 1987 when he came out with  rby album, and several others after until he changed his name to Sananda Maitreya in 2001.   
My bad, I put Lausanne in the Title block but not in the main text!   
Anybody been to the D! Club in, of course, Lausanne?   
			
			Terrence Trent Darby used to be on my wall as a teenager, would love to see him if he did his hold stuff, alas Lausanne a bit too far..
		 
			
			I think I might go to this.    
Will just have to stay up all night and get the first train home  .
		 
			
			Nicky n Natasha   
I think he will play some of the older charts and newer ones too.   
Maybe he is on tour and coming to your area?  I had no idea about this Lausanne gig until I read it in   this Saturday morning.   
Or if you would like a very nice youth hostel near the lake in Lausanne here it is.  Highly recommended and very reasonably priced.  Think 39 chf room with breakfast       
			
			Recently discovered  covering concerts in Switzerland (landlockedblues). May be of interest to see who's around and get the er, skinny. (Is that right? Skinny? Is that still in?)
		 
			
			Deep Purple have you seen this?

			Just seen Trentemoeller is at Hive club tomorrow night (13th)
		 
			
			New Young Pony Club at Hive club on 26th April.       
			
			Woot woot!  Hockey at Abart tomorrow.   
It's total ausverkauf, but it might be worth turning up to get tickets on the door.
		 
			
			Tindersticks are playing Kaufleuten, Zurich on May 5th.   
Miserable feckers. Great live.
		 
			
			It looks like tickets are available on the door for Hockey.   
Doors open at 7.30 . . .
		 
			
			There's a free gig tonight at   by  .   
It starts at 22.00       
			
			The White Lies gig for tonight has been cancelled.   
""Dearest fans. Charles from White Lies here. Im am so so sorry to say that we have to cancel tomorrows show in Munich and the following day in Zurich because Harry has picked up a very nasty viral infection which has destroyed his voice. He's seen doctors from various parts of Europe over the last few days and overdosed on every steroid/anti-inflamatory and pain-killer we could get hold of. But it hasn't worked and today we had to come off stage in Vienna after only 3 songs. We're so sad to have to re-schedule these two shows once again. We had been looking forward to them since December. Please be assured that we will still play these shows for you as soon as we finish the next album and by then have exclusive new songs for you. Love from us all. C W/L""       
(Credit to Dan for spotting this!)
		   are playing at Moods in Zürich as part of the M4Music festival. Saturday, 27th March at 23.00   
Goody goody
		 
			
			anyone going to Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten tonight?
		    A definite Yes!!!       Me, too, me too!
		    Hadouken are a good live act. Noisy fun.   
Very polite young chaps too.   
Here are some photos I took when I saw them in London in 2008:           
			
			Eminem, Jay-Z, Fantastischen Vier, Jan Delay, Stress,...whole bunch others:   
Frauenfeld-weekend of the 9th July.
		 
			
			Gogol Bordello on May 26th in Zurich:       
I unfortunately will be out of town.  
I've seen them once before in concert and they are absolutely amazing....
		 
			
			Faithless are coming to Zurich!    
April 27th at Vilkshaus       
			
			R Kelly will be in Basel the 3rd of April:          Lock up your 15 year old daughters!    
			
			Right, bought my John Butler Trio Tickets for 25th April. 
Can't wait!! Anyone know who support band is?
		 
			
			Benga comes to Bern on the 3rd of April at Reitschule.   
Haven't yet been to a pure dubstep night, this seems like one to go for.  Might be my first night out in Bern too.
		 
			
			Mos Def 24th April at Rote Fabrik. Have put an event in the  .
		 
			
			The Reverend Horton Heat (USA),  Fr 02.04.2010, Zurich       
highly recommended. i've seen them 3 times and if it were not for the concert being in zurich, i'd be there again.    
			
			Damn, sometime I miss living in Zurich...Les Claypool at the Abart club on 10 March.        
			
			Pink Martini a the Kaufleuten 15th July     
			
			and Cat Empire at Schutzenhaus Uetliberg, Zürich           
I guess the title of his tour (""Ladies make some noise"") tells it all    
			
			An hip hop event during Easter in Zurich. It will be the fisrt edition.   
Method Man, The Beatnuts, De la Soul, IAM, Diam's, Hocus Pocus and more performing between the 2nd of April and the 4th of April.             
Imogen Heap is playing tommorow night at Abart, I think tickets are still available.   
			
			I almost bought tickets for      =   
but I'm not sure.    
Opinion anyone?
		 
			
			Posting on behalf of a friend of mine, he organises Stoner rock bands to come over here.  Rock isn't normally my thing but I've hugely enjoyed every concert he put on.   
Locations are either Sedel or the Blues Bar, both in Luzern.  Sedel is the old womens prison, just outside of town, Blues Bar is a tiny room at the back of a latin nightclub, just past schuur.               
			
			Ash are playing Abart on 25th May     
Last time I went to see them was at the University of London Union...seem to remember the night ended up with me drinking Snakebite and Blacks, whilst arm wrestling students...not quite had a similar experience in Switzerland so far...
		 
			
			The Strokes, Stone Temple Pilots, Billy Talent, LCD Soundsystem, NOFX, Wolfmother, 30 Seconds to Mars, White Lies, Kasabian:   
24-27 June, St Gallen.   
Gonna be a rough weekend!
		    Yeah . . . especially without any decent bands        
*GROAN*   
sorry DJ Bobo wasn't available, he's kinda hard to get a hold of this time of the year
		    Well, I'd probably give LCD Soundsystem the time of day . . .   
And I note that The Strokes have a new album out in 2010.   
Not the freshest line up though, is it?
		 
			
			Yeah, I'm really going for the Strokes and STP (and I have a gulity pleasure for Billy Talent too, but I'm in therapy for it).   
The rest will just be cool filler, perhaps some surprises.
		 
			
			Huge Euro festivals suck. Small festivals suck harder. It's all a big con to get us to consume more product. Bring back touring.
		    What you want is small 'conference' festivals in towns:  SXSW, Stag and Dagger, The Great Escape
		    What I want is a seven foot blond chick with natural curves and green eyes who'll turn into a pizza at 3am, but I appreciate your sentiment.
		    Certain to be available at all the above events, if you do them right.
		    Ahhh I saw Ash at the Astoria last year. It was great. I will try and get along to this one. It's a school night though    
Happy memories of ULU... They used to do the best nachos to go with your snakebite!
		 
			
			I've seen Ash 3 or 4 times at various stages of their career and they have yet to be less than awesome   Best time was in a little venue in Hastings and Silver Sun were the support.   
Ah, Silver Sun - their debut album was fantastic!!
		 
			
			Saxon - Z7 - Thursdsay night.
		 
			
			Blood Red Shoes at Abart on March 29th          Indeed           
Looking forward to it lots.
		    please tell your friend to send some of these bands to lausanne...      concert cancelled !!!
		 
			
			The Moon and Stars' festival (in Locarno) programme is available:       
Too bad that Locarno is that far!!!   
I hope that JK will give another concert elswhere in Switzerland       Would go to see LCD, STP and Wolfmo but the FREAKIN World Cup is on, priorities priorities.    
I see the Gurten has Faith No More headlining - enough said. Wont be going to see that rubbish again.
		    They'll be showing all the matches from big screens so it won't be that you'll have to miss anything....btw Mike Patton is GOD!
		    To be honest its the WorldCup, I need to be comfortable when Im watching the Greatest Show on Earth!   
Hmmm MP is a deity huh... The Real Thing is their seminal album granted, in fact I still regularly listen to it, but their material got progressively Pattonised (weird and experimental in want of actual music) culminating in the God awful Mr Bungle. Discuss...
		     
I don't know how I can discuss such ignorance politely    
Different strokes I suppose and if you prefer the Mike Patton that sings Lionel Richie covers then so be it... I guess I couldn't interest you in his work with John Zorn then       No need to be polite, we are discussing Patton after all. Angel Dust was after The Real Thing, and about the time I started to loose interest. Jizzlobber was the last straw. Terrible.
		 
			
			I for one am stoked to see FNM headlining the Gurten Festival!!!    
btw...   
epic < angel dust < king for a day < album  of the year   
tomahawk is also awesome.   
peeping tom is really good too.    
mr bungle and fantomas are acquired tastes but absolutely incredible live.
		     
what's a world cup?         
Sorry, not my thing
		    Unfortunately this world cup is not played with sticks so guess your national team didnt qualify, u could always support the USA       He does a great job, I'll post them up in events shortly, but if you'e a big fan of any of the bands, it'd worth the trip to Luzern.  Both venues are very small and you get right up close to the band.
		 
			
			Soccer world cup? I know what id rather do..... Anything. But then again I'll watch anything when im loaded   
Anyone going to this M4 music thingo tomorrow? Keen to see Jose Gonzalez again. Last time I saw him the sound was awful and it was a horrible setup
		    Jeff Beck!
		    yeah but in support of ZZ Top? ewww....      
but i will say tho that Jeff Beck was amazing at Montreux Jazz Festival a couple years ago. probably my favorite guitarist evah!    
			
			FYI Paleo Festival has announced their lineup....meh           
besides Iggy & the Stooges & Indochine... meh indeed
		    Two Door Cinema Club and We Have Band are worth seeing.   
Foals are very definitely worth seeing . . . amazing live performers.  Klaxons too.   
I'll happily dance to Vitalic and Yuksek.   
N*E*R*D pretty good live too.
		    So I can see what snazzy dressers they are? Sorry, generic ""indie"" music bores me nowadays. Good point about N.E.R.D. & Vitalic though.
		    There's a big difference between TDCC and something like Coldplay or the Kooks.  There's electronica and afro-pop in there.  Yes, they're snappy dressers, but that's part of the deal if you sign to Kitsuné.  Not sure how they'd come across on a festival stage though.
		     
Which they stole from Vampire Weekend, who stole it from Paul Simon, who stole it from Fela Kuti. Shame he's dead now...
		    . . .  who stole it from someone else in Africa . . . etc etc blah blah blah   
You think there's a chance of completely ahistoric music with no antecedents?  And that bands shouldn't use some of the same sounds and influences?  TTCM fall some way in between Vampire Weekend and Foals, but have their own sound.  Vampire Weekend are more preppy/New England.  Foals miss out the Afro-pop, but have some of the same kind of indie-dance and free range guitar.
		    meh indeed
		   26.05.2010: Foals @ Abart, Zurich  
Tickets are available from    
			
			Port O'Brien playing in Zurich, Basel and Luzern this weekend. I have seen them in Dublin before and they were great live! Recommend.   
Hopefully they will still make it despite volcano issues!
		 
			
			Stevie Wonder at Moon and Stars on 7th July.
		 
			
			Crystal Castles at rohstofflager, Zürich on the 27th April, might try and make that.
		    play the Idaplatzfest in Zurich, 21st August, showcasing their second album      Perhaps      playing this Friday night at 8pm at Kaufleuten Zurich.
		 
			
			Not sure if it's already pegged in here, but The Eels are playing in Winterthur on August 28th, supported by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  Tix are 54 CHF from Starticket.   
Also the night before, Paolo Nutini is playing the same spot.   
Looks like an open air music week in old town Winterthur, should be cool. (Events already created for both in the Concerts calendar)
		 
			
			I've created a social event in the calendar for the Tunng gig on Wednesday.
		 
			
			this looks promising:        
at least for friday night.       What is it about the Swiss and Skunk Ananse?? 
Every other country got tired of them in weeks!   
The Eels looks promising!
		     
When you figure that out please explain to me their fascination with Amy Macdonald.   
It's just Eels btw, no ""the""
		     Cool, miss living there.
		    Anyone fancy it, or already going?
		    Er . . . that was last night wasn't it?
		    May, no?   
(too short)
		    Ooops . . .  I am living in the future!     (Yes . . . there are flying cars here and everything)   
			
			This looks good, an open-air festival for Zurich at long last.  i'll be there for Underworld and Booka Shade.  I'll try for Placebo but tradition dictates I turn up right at the end of their encore...          I've posted an event for this:       
			
			Bump for the Tindersticks playing at Kaufleuten tonight. Anyone else in?
		 
			
			Jimi Tenor and Tony Allen at the Kaserne tonight (8/5/10). Tony Allen was the band leader for Fela Kuti, but his solo stuff since then is less of the traditional afrobeat. Fans of experimental rock and jazz should check it out!
		 
			
			They obviously like it here     
mo. 29.11. -  - abart
		   Mike Patton's Mondo Cane   Thursday , 29.07.2010   20h00  Luzern (CH)  KKL Luzern - Konzertsaal    
			
			A.R Rahman concert 
Hallenstadion Zurich 
16 July        thanks for posting. that would be a VERY interesting show to see.    
but it seems like most concert announcements just make me realize i'm on the wrong side of switzerland.       Foals were amazing last night.  Tracks from the second album are generally more contemplative than those from the first and therefore less appropriate for a live performance.  The old/new split was about 70/30.  It's just incredible the way the band plays together . . . precise but intensely passionate.  Many times throughout the gig I just went 'wow'.  The final song, 'One Step, Two Step' left the crowd on a high.
		 
			
			not sure if anyone has posted it yet, but Slash is touring his new album in June. He's playing X-tra on the 16th of June. Miles Kennedy is on vocal duties.   
from what i've read they are playing a healthy mix of tracks from Slashs' back catalogue and the new stuff.  i'm really looking forward to this one.           
			
			Another overlooked festival, just saw a poster for it...Neuchatel Open Air.   
Cypress Hill! Looks like a nice location too.        
			
			What about the   in Lucerne   
Shame about the name.... I think its for the sexually frustrated
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this but....      - Abart, Monday 5th July, CHF35   
Fo sho!
		    Oh how gutted i was to hear this was on the 5th July, the day i go on holiday! VERY gutted
		    damn have my mother here from Oz that week. Might take her with us    
			
			Almost missed this one, John Garcia plays Kyuss at Schuur tonight (2nd June), Luzern.
		 
			
			i'm going to see them tomorrow in lausanne. i didn't bother posting coz i really didn't think there was anyone here interested.   
should i also mention baroness is playing in fribourg in july? my new favorite band.    
			
			A band I know will be playing Thu, June 10 in Stall 6. 
African Percussions and a singer from Gambia. 
P-Train & Lamine Jobarteh.   
CHF 10.-            
			
			The Kissaway Trail the highlight (for me) of this year's For Noise festival in Pully (near Lausanne).       
			
			I'm surprised no one has mentioned Prince in Geneva on 12 July.        
			
			Not sure if this has already been mentioned   
29th Sept Hallenstadion    
I am so there!   
Tickets for ticket corner members went on sale today, general public tomorrow I think, many pre sales tickets already sold out so get up early tomorrow folks    
			
			Say what now? I thought I knew you! interwebz-wise.       stick with me Debz and i'll show you the way    
come on who can not be a Peter Gabriel fan?
		             
anyone born after 1980       Phil Collins fans?
		 
			
			anyone coming to Bsides festival today?
		 
			
			Possibly, keeping an eye on the weather.
		    Damn . . . didn't spot that.  Not sure if I can come now.   
Three Trapped Tigers are excellent.
		 
			
			Hmmmm . . . Crystal Fighters are playing at the Imagine Festival in Basel tomorrow.       
Am I right in thinking this is free?   
Anyone else going?
		     
it is free, might be going.
		 
			
			I've already booked and paid for my Guns n Roses tickets.   
Geneva, 16th September at the Arena (beside the Airport)
		 
			
			I'm probably a bit slow off the mark, but Mumford and Sons are playing (with Sophie Hunger) the Montreux JF on 14th July. Tickets are note available on the ticketcorner site but, unlike other, it is not marked as sold out on the Montreux site.   
I'm also very tempted by Julian Casablancas with Vampire Weekend but at 80.- it's a bit steep. There are tickets available for that though.   
Does anyone know where else I might be able to get tickets? I can get to Montreux to buy them next week if this is necessary...   
Merci d'avance!
		 
			
			More rock at Sedel, Luzern.   
July 2nd 
Yawning Man   
July 4th 
Mondo Generator   
July 8th 
Valient Thorr
		 
			
			Devendra Banhart is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, Tuesday July 13th. Tickets from        
			
			Its not a Swiss gig so please don't shoot me down but we are off Wed to Belgium to what I reckon is the BEST open air festival in the world.....   
Werchter Festival is so damn well organised and has a solid line up every year. Just 8 hours drive. You can't beat it peoples.   
ROCKONAUSTRALIA !!!        decent festival but Primavera destroys all
		 
			
			careful with your ears, folks.    
my last concert, john garcia plays kyuss, might be my last concert.    
since then, i have tinnitus. BAD. this sucks.    
i will post up some tinnitus info at some point but please take care of your ears.   
/sweet blog
		    Nice!  I may have to think about this... haven't had my fill of weird yet this year.    One of my all-time favorites:   
[maybe this should be in song of the day...]   
But on a Tuesday?!? Come on!   
EDIT: Anyone here planning to go?  I am so up for it but pretty sure my roomie wouldn't be interested...
		 
			
			Baby was a black sheep, baby was a whore. Baby got big but she's gonna get bigger..... Anyone going to see Patti Smith in the Rote Fabrik on Wednesday? 
I really hope she only plays old songs, but it's not too far to walk home if she does.
		 
			
			here's an 'under-the-radar' festival...in grandson VD...          Oh man, missed that and probably can't go now.   
Love this song:       
			
			It'll be outside, on the lakeside, so you could in theory, come watch the football, outside, and listen to her in the background. It's going to be quite a night! I'll be up on the roof!        I really should be but the devil on my left shoulder told me to go watch football instead.
		 
			
			Rodney Branigan at the Cava.....     
			
			anyone interested in Baroness at Bad Bonn (Düdingen), 13 July? I got some super dooper expensive earplugs to try out.        
			
			Patti was legendary. The lake was magnificent, and Germany lost. Was that the perfect night?        crap i just saw this! i love patti smith- seen her a ton of times and poetry stuff too... wish i knew i'd have definitely gone...   
i've even got a gorgeous photo of her holding my then 6month old son at a poetry event in nyc... wah. a bit sad now i need to keep up on these things...   
			
			I want to be half that cool when I'm 62!       I would have loved to have gone , but I got the feeling that you would have got the weird Patti doing performance art versions of stuff, rather than the angry Horses version ... 
If it was the later then I wish I had gone !
		    was incredible.                
			
			T'was the latter. I expected a post-menapausal, I know it all and I'm gonna pass on the word Patti, but she rocked! Right up til her final song, which was rock and roll nigga. Having said that, she didn't actually do horses.     
			
			The Coral are playing Abart on November 2nd   
Should be a really good gig and tickets are only 35CHF       
			
			Mike Patton fans- Mondo Cane will be in Lucerne the 29th at the  .

11.10 mystery jets @ abart, zurich 
19.10 the cinematics @ hafenkneipe, zurich 
19.11. the drums @ abart

          30.11.             (usa) &    (uk)   
sif you would go to Helmet. ffs its HELMET!!!!
		     
almost word for word what a friend said to me when he saw that    
Xiu Xiu in St Gallen in November..
		 
			
			ooh, i'd like to see those Drums in action.  (is the day before my birthday too, sounds like a good excuse for a big friday night)   
i'd be interested in seeing kate nash covered in whipped cream and lip-synching too, but only for laughs             A very good excuse indeed! It would be nice to see you there ... I've got my ticket ...      Yep, I agree, only for laughs, but as I do not like the location, I most probably skip that one.
		 
			
			i have just been informed that the Scissor Sisters are playing the on the 15th of November.          HELL YEAH!    
but that's a looong drive for a tuesday night.      
holy crap! after a quick search they are playing in Yverdon on Dec 1st. STOKED!
		    hope they are better than when they were at hallenstadion, worst gig in my history of gigs and i only had to endure half of it
		    I'll buy ya a beer, so take the train    
			
			02.12.2010 gossip @ x-tra, zurich 
info:   (german)
		 
			
			I see Booker T is playing  tomorrow (21st July). Rather peeved to only spot this now, plus to have to miss it due to soccerball.
		    wish i could. you're very lucky to have the abart. when i lived in zurich, i only saw 3 concerts there (in 3 years) due to working so much and just being out of the loop. recently i went and looked at the history of who has been there since i left in 2001 and thought i was gonna be sick.    
king's x at the abart was one of my favoritist shows ever.    
			
			Here's a few gigs that might be of interest in the ""near"" future:   
Pendulum 30/09 Xtra CHF45   
Goldfrapp 05/10 Xtra CHF60   
The Coral 02/11 Abart CH37   
Carl Barat (The Libertines, Dirty Pretty Things) 09/11 Mascotte CHF46   
Caribou 09/11 Abart CHF37   
Beach House 16/11 Kaufleuten CHF43   
The Drums 19/11 Abart CHF43   
Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan 26/11 Kaufleuten CHF48   
Blood Red Shoes 29/11 Abart CHF35     Sorry for any repeats!   
			
			Pendulum, oh boy, might have to get in early on that one..
		 
			
			Kap Bambino at X-Tra in Zürich this Friday!       
(not sure that's the best of venues though)
		 
			
			It's notable how many bands return to Zürich soon after playing here.  Dan mentioned Blood Red Shoes above, Beach House too.  Do they think it's cool here or is it the strong CHF?   
Here's another returner . . . Au Revoir Simone at Abart on August 23rd, they were good at Stall 6 last September.   
Other acts that may or not be returning:   
Mystery Jets at Abart on 11th October 
Yuck at Hafenkneipe on 3rd November 
Plan B at Kaufleuten on 14th November

Eintritt Frei!
		    Paging Gastro Gnome...that thoroughly nice chap is playing for free    
Sadly I'll be somewhere else...   
Oh, and I assume you mean September instead of October       Funnily enough I've met Gilles a couple of times through a friend.  She was visiting London from Estonia and was a big fan of worldwide.  She went to his club and got chatting to him.  He invited her to his house the next day and sent her off with a load of vinyl . . . she went back to Tallinn and became a DJ.  Nice chap.   
Have I already told you that story before?
		     
nice lil' story which doesn't amaze me all that much. Peterson seems like such a nice bloke at least on the radio show    
I might make the drive out ... Zükunft is such a great little club with an awesome vibe and the woodblock prints for announcing the nights
		    I'm not sure you got to the vinyl bit as those pesky Foals were a playing there thingys awfully loud    
*worldwide worldwide worldwide*
		    Ah yes . . . it's all coming back to me . . .
		 
			
			Is anybody heading to Rote Fabrik on Saturday to see The Maccabees?   
It's free from what i can understand of this-        
I might be if I can get out of prior arrangements
		 
			
			Pink Floyd fans should be headed to Dietikon, ZH Saturday evening 9-18-10:          Brilliant!  Yeah . . . I'd like to go and see them.

			The Morning Benders tonight at Salzhaus Winterthur   
support is the fantastic Sheila She Loves You from Basel
		 
			
			I can't believe I just read about Maccabees now it now. 
They are pretty cool!
		    It was an excellent gig, more so for being free.  We should lobby them to return.
		 
			
			The brilliant band The Wedding Present are playing on the 31 october in the Mariaberg in Rorschach:     
...why Rorschach       And they're playing Bizarro!?!?!?!?!   
Hmmm . . . might have to look at a hotel there . . .
		    Yes might be an option.    
Not doable on public transport as the last train departing towards Zurich leaves at 22.40.   
Why don't they play at the Volkshaus in Zurich like normal bands do?  
Don't get their marketing strategy?!   But then if they ever had a marketing strategy they'd be a world famous band by now.
		    Their biggest marketing push, as far as I remember, was quite perverse and involved releasing a seven inch single for every month of 1992.  I had 'em all, but have somehow lost track of them.       too much apple pie, Tubbs           
I just checked them out - thanks for the tip - I love them!!  Shame they don't have more dates up on their calendar but I will keep an eye out.  Hope there are more bands like them around - gives me hope    
			
			Nothing beats   for finding out what's on. 
You filter by date, price, distance willing to travel, can link to other social sites etc..
		    How do I see everything in Zürich.   
It just came back with this limited selection:        Hmmm . . . I tried registering.   
Does it only show you bands you track?      I've just spent ten minutes getting nothing but frustrated with that site.  I simply want to see what's on in Zürich.  Instead it seems I have to track a load of bands.  Can't I just track Zürich?
		    Don't know if you meant Sheila she loves you or the morning benders but if it was the first they are playing in La Catrina in Zürich tmw evening for   good idea to get there a bit early though as it fills up quickly.
		    They usually play at least 3 times a year in Switz anyhow..
		    Who told you that? The Wedding Present have hardly ever played 3 times a year in Switzerland (if ever).
		    Yes - Shelia she loves you - I won't be in Switzerland until the 11th October but will checking out all the bands and venues.  Do the gigs usually finish in time to catch the last train back from Zurich to Basel?  Here in scotland there are some venues that run 7 to 10 pm and last train is about 11pm but most venues run to midnight or later.
		    Well if you're moving to Basel I'm sure you'll have plenty of chances to see them. Most venues try to finish in time for the last train but it doesn't always work out.
		    Perhaps slightly exaggerated but they do come through quite often. I know for sure they've played Sommercasino in Basel several times.
		     
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finntroll @ Konzertfabrik Z7 - Dec 12!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't know that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank the holy lord that I was browsing this thread!!!!! One of my current favorite Bands of all time... Slightly strange coincidence too.   
So um, anybody else going?    
			
			Black Rebel Motorcycle Club @ Zurich Volkshaus November 14th   
Can find it listed everywhere but can't find tickets yet...
		   , Luzern on the 15th of October, unfortunately I'll miss it as I'm DJ at Bar 59 the same night.
		 
			
			for those in Lausanne. BRMC are also playing at a festival on the 13.11.2010       
can't find Zurich tickets yet either, but i'll be there.

there you go.
		 
			
			Nick Cave and the Grindermen will be playing at the Folkshaus next Tuesday in Zürich. Anyone else going?

Shellac is playing in Bern on the same day , a bit torn between the two.If he would be singing bad seeds songs it would be easier.
		 
			
			Tell me about it! I'm immersing myself in Grinderman, to get used to it so I won't be too confused on the day. Having said that, they may do a couple of their badseed songs.       
			
			Dollhouse (SWE) play mascotte today (tuesday)- starts around 20h and some norwegian band will open for them.

Fribourg   
Bandsintown.com is pretty cool but has some limitations. I'd like to be able to opt out specific locations (like Zurich and anything in France) and it would be cool if you could feed it a list of bands from your music collection. Aside from that a nice utility. A friend told me about something similar that works with your itunes collections, feeds your band names into a database and returns upcoming concerts for bands in your collection plus similar bands.
		    How was the show?      Thank you!   
27th October @            
			
			Not sure if its been mentioned but a band from my home town in Australia are playing on Nov 5. Really Psychedelic but pretty decent the only time ive seen them    
Tame Impala 
Nov 5 @ Mascotte, Zurich
		 
			
			Club night rather than gig: Nu:Tone (Hospital Records)* & Stamina MC are playing at Kaserne, Basel on Sat 23rd Oct:    
Will be heading over from Zurich, anyone else going?   
* UK Drum and Bass producer and DJ
		 
			
			A bit disapointing to be honest. Maybe it was just too early in the tour. Some of it worked, some of it was a disaster. Nick was looking alot like Bunny Munroe.        Hmm. I saw him in Liverpool once; someone shouted ""C'mon Phil Collins"" and he never recovered. To think he let Kylie slip from his arms...
		 
			
			I don't want to talk about         I've met stamina at a house party once. Hes a cool dude. I could make it out for this one. I love hospital artists
		 
			
			Anyone going to see Santana tonight? My old man (who is a good laugh) is going by himself and he probaly wouldn't mind meeting up with some fellow old skool fans.       Anyone going to the Deftones show in Fribourg?  Has anyone been to that venu; is it large, small etc?  Thanks!
		    depending on which hall they use it can hold anywhere from 300 to about 3000 people. Considering it's the Deftones I'd imagine it would be the larger one. Frison is one of the best concert venues in Switz imo. One drawback to it though is that if you're in Basel or ZH it's often difficult to get back home with the train if you wanna stay till the end of the concert.
		    i'm going!    
i saw mastodon there last spring and i enjoyed it but have to say the acoustics there are pretty bad. there are certain spots where the reverberations from the big walls will turn the music into a horrible constant roar. a few feet to the left or right and it's ok again. also, there are no elevated viewing areas (all just a big floor) so if you are on the short side it might not be ideal. otherwise, i like the old warehouse style of venue.
		    Hmm, well i'd be comming from Basel so i guess i should start to look for someone with a car (if anyone is going anway?) or try and find a place to stay.  I wish there were better concert venues in Basel!  Thanks for the info!
		     
a friend of mine might be going with a car. Ask me when the time comes.
		    Cool, I'll prob catch the train over in the eve, let me know if you want to meet up.
		 
			
			Saw sharon jones and the dap kings last night @ kaufleuten and they were amazing. Invited two of my mates and they also raved about the show.   
First time ive been to kaufleuten too. Really cool venue. Might be a little posh for me though    
			
			Anyone going to see   on Friday?  Let me know, I'm going with another lady friend by train from Zurich hb.
		 
			
			The excellent Bonobo is playing a few dates in Switzerland 
Les Docks, Lausanne on 8/12 
Moods, Zurich on 17/12

Or only CHF33 from Starticket
		    Ooh! Ooh!  I would totally join for Seu Jorge! But I'll be out of town.  
Ah well, next time. 
Let me know how the show is; never seen him live and most of the albums I love of his are *quite* a few years old.
		    Check out his  stuff!  
If you haven't already seen the LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU you must.
		    Balls. Im back home for Xmas. Bonobo is dooooooope
		 
			
			is there anyone interested in two free tickets to KARMA TO BURN playing in Martigny on Nov 3rd? i can't go now due to other plans. i hate to see good tickets go to waste...PM me if interested.
		     
Decent band and nice guys. I would take those tickets off you if only 1) I knew where Martigny was, and 2) David Max and the Sons of Void weren't playing in Basel and Spectrum weren't playing in Basel on the same night.
		 
			
			i was all set to drive an hour to martigny to see them, bought 2 tickets for me and a friend, then later discovered that i had mistaken the date and have another concert (public enemy) on the same night. then to top it off, they booked another show in yverdon on the next night, which is even closer than martigny. i'm planning to go to that one.        
Thank you so much for your post!   
I am definitely going to Seu Jorge's concert! 
Is anyone from Basel joining too?!
		 
			
			Moorcheeba with Skye (26th) in Zurich  
Sounds great, anyone going?
		 
			
			The Black Keys will be performing @ Rote Fabrik next March. 
Should be good!
		 
			
			Do we list club nights here or elsewhere?   
Anyway . . . looks like there's a good thing happening this weekend at Uto Kulm.  That's three legendary DJs!          Cheers for that, to confirm 24th March CHF35....Linky    
Sweet    
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned   as a gig guide/general stuff to do resource...just happened to see a copy of it on the tram this morning and it's a pretty comprehensive       Indeed.  I'm not sure if it's entirely comprehensive though.   
The @zueritipp Twitter feed is laughable.
		 
			
			ooooooH!!!! 
Coming back from the Cirque tonight I saw a poster for    for 25CHF next Thursday the 28th of October!

			Went there for the first time last night to see Caribou and Shy Child - what a fantastic dive it is ! I miss the toilet venues in London (Dublin Castle, Windmill, Notting Hill Arts Club and so on) and this place would not look out of place if it was in a side street off Oxford Street.   
Recommended if you like down and dirty venues and interesting up and coming bands.   
Shy Child totally kicked bottom. I enjoyed Caribou but after half an hour felt I had enjoyed them sufficiently.   
Coming up - Beach House, The Swans, A Place To Bury Strangers and in January The Fall   
Pay on the door, no advance booking, no credit cards. Like stepping back to the seventies but in a GOOD way.           
Ive been hearing her songs in the local Migros a lot actually. Maybe they have her album or that she's gaining a little notoriety in Switzerland?
		 
			
			of course, in response to this....  i have to offer up the original.  I was never a massive Chisel fan, before my time, but I know every word to this one.                     Only the two in Zurich...but at the Xavier Rudd on 21st and Panteon Rococo on 24th (also in abart)

		    Strangely at the same address as Dollhouse  . Could make for some interesting shows.
		    So I look on their website and pop up a post. And then the next day I get a newsletter saying that it's not Zurich but Luzern.

			If any of youse are keen on your blues, C.W. Stoneking is playing @ El Lokal, Zurich on the 27th Feb.    
His version of seven nation army on TripleJ a few years ago was a think of beauty. Id post it but its block out of Australia    
			
			Ah, I can't believe I missed Lambchop. And Mark Lanegan, that hurts. And Einsturz. And New Model Army, they are still playing? Wowsies...I should really watch this thread.
		 
			
			Also I saw K&D are playing at Volkshaus on Jan 29th. Im super double mega pumped to see this if anyone's keen for a catch up
		    just got informed that johen arbeit will not be be playing after all      UPDATE VOM 07.01.2011: Leider musste Jochen  Arbeit die Tour aus familiären Gründen absagen. Brian Mitchell wird aber  im Café Kairo eine Solo-Show spielen.      Love love love C.W. Stoneking!   He will also be playing at ISC in Bern on 17th of Feb - this has just made my day.

Hope this link works

Hang Me Out to Dry     
			
			<3 the Cold War Kids! Thanks for the heads up on this show!      I've been living in Boston for two years now, and will be moving to Basel in a couple of months. The Dropkick Murphys put on a great show!
		 
			
			Thanks for the heads up...I saw them in Manchester many moons ago, and unfortunately they really did come off as a two/three song band. Still might be worth a watch in a small venue like the Abart.          When will you be in Basel?  If you want to meet up and have a chat or see a show drop me a line    Always nice to meet someone comming from Boston.
		    Sounds like a good show.  I will probably join.  Anyone else going?  Is this venu easy to get to from the main station?
		    Hi JustRose,       (from the Bahnhofquai/HB tramstop)  direction Albisgütli and get off at the Sihlcity Nord stop or you can catch the S4 Train (from track 1 at the Zürich HB) and get off at the Gieshubel stop. Both stops are walking distance.       Looks like the Black Keys have cancelled    
On the plus side Mogwai will play Rote Fabrik on Friday 11th March, tickets CHF35.

			Thin Lizzy are playing at Z7 in Pratteln on Thursday 3rd Feb.
		 
			
			I'm definitely going to catch the Foo Fighters at Greenfield this year. The teaser for new sound songs great (well at least the first 30 seconds). Sounds more like their older stuff.     
			
			my favourite song of the foo fighters is "" my hero"", followed by ""the pretender"" and ""wheels"". 
Looking forward to the festival........
		 
			
			I can't make it to Greenfield this year as ill be away so am planning to go to Southside festival (in southern germany) instead.  Anyone been to southside in past years?  It looks like a really great lineup this year: 
Foo Fighters * Blink-182 * Arcade Fire * The Chemical Brothers *Portishead * Arctic Monkeys * Clueso * The Hives * The Subways * Gogol Bordello * Flogging Molly * Elbow * The Wombats * Sublime With Rome * Two Door Cinema Club * Boysetsfire * Selig * Band Of Horses * The Sounds * Klaxons * Eels * Sick Of It All * Parkway Drive * William Fitzsimmons * I Am Kloot * Friendly Fires * Darwin Deez * Converge * Comeback Kid * Portugal. The Man * Kvelertak * You Me At Six * Brother * Cloud Control...
		 
			
			It's a worthy line up.  . The festival will be mid June.

I'm not a huge Streets fan, but this is a must see as it will be the final tour ever.
		    I'll be there! Anyone else?

			Ever since we moved to basel in October we have been on the hunt for local unsigned indie bands in cool small venues.  So far we have been to 2 gigs - both great but we are used to 2 or 3 a week!!!  Seems the venues are here but not always our genre of music (too heavy or hip-hop etc..)  so after waiting patiently - we have 2 gigs next weekend!! And all Swiss bands!!   
Friday the 25th at Kuppel for the Choo Choo's of Bern and the Kapoolas from Basel   
Saturday the 26th for Basel's own: Shelia She Loves You and the Oh' No's (two of the bands we've already seen) at the Union Kultur Club.   
Along with seeing the Charivari on Monday night (to see the Top Secret Drummers) its gonna be a good week!!!!
		 
			
			^ Sheila She Loves You are fab - their last gig at la Catrina in ZH last year was my fave gig of the whole year. I hope they make it back to ZH sometime soon!
		 
			
			Queens of the Stone Age   
At Komplex 457   
on 11th May
		     YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!                Gimme....where?
		 
			
			In basel try out 
Nordstern 
Hirshnek 
NT areal
		    Cheers for the heads up. Just bagged me some tickets      The one venue we really liked was Sommer Casino - they do a lot of rock, metal as well as hip/hop.  Only a couple indie nights over the last few months.  Also look at the Kaserne - this is right near us and looks fab from the outside but nothing on their calendar really appeals to us.
		    I have to yet find heavy and actually interesting here, but it is not like I venture out much for this, we live in a tiny place...so gota give it real chance. The stuff I have heard was either to eager to be heavy, leaving everything else behind, or noise for the sake of noise, but I am sure there is something worth listening.
		 
			
			queens of the stone age will also be at this year's kilby at bad bonn!!!! can't wait to find out the rest of the lineup!           Just some info on tix: tickets go on sale this  , limited to 4 per person, from either        
or        
Tix are expected to sell out fast, so get in quick!
		 
			
			After lots of wondering why there had been no news, I was sad to hear today that there will be no Zurich Open Air Festival this year   - last year's line-up was so awesome.   
BUT   
it is confirmed for 2012. Yay!       
			
			Bad Kilbi Bonn's a great festival, great atmosphere and generally good bands there. I saw the legendary Sunn o))) there a couple of years ago.
		     :d
		    And they are now sold out.
		 
			
			The Sadies @ El Lokal May 29 ... Also playing the Stolze Open Air Festival Zurich on May 28th     
cheers, 
Sue
		    ahem      
Anyway. She was fantastic.   
It was my first time at Komplex. And it's tiny. I was expecting somewhere a bit bigger than abart but I think it's actually smaller. Although it does have a higher ceiling which helps with the sound.
		    Smaller than Abart?!  Mmkay, explains why QOTSA sold out so quickly.
		    I'm sad that I missed her      
The Komplex venue can be rearranged for bigger shows. The walls are all moveable - actually it's a huge space. That's why it can accommodate bigger acts like QOTSA, My Chemical Romance, Interpol etc etc as well as the smaller ones (Phoenix Foundation, Caitlin Rose) I think the capacity is up to 5000.
		 
			
			Looks like British Sea Power have cancelled their March European tour,  including the Abart gig on the 09.03.11.    
Not sure why....but Noble cracked a rib at the last gig. Bummer!   
Gigs will hopefuly be re-scheduled for later in 2011.
		    Yep, it is planned to be re-scheduled ... or at least that is the plan so far. Fingers crossed!       I used to love Belle and Sebastian until I saw them at Open Air last year, they were pretty lame.    
			
			Haha, got sucked in and forgot what I came on here originally to post    
Anyone else going to Roger Waters this summer? I am already looking forward to it!! I just can't wait haha    
			
			I am going! can't wait       I bought The Boy With The Arab Strap when it first came out on vinyl but never really got into it. Then late last year I bought the latest and love it. Since then I have bought all of the CD's so I hope I'm not disappointed but I think they will be better indoors than out. And it should have a totally different vibe to a festival.

José is a world renowned guitarist, born in Brazil but living in Nyon. He used to teach at the Geneva conservatoire, and has appeared many times at The Paleo and Montreux Jazz festivals. A brilliant artist.
		    When you think they started as a college project, they've come far from the days of playing King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow.   
I've seen them a few times and they always deliver, but can get a little twee. At one show at the Rote Fabrik they covered Dire Straits' Romeo and Juliet. Hmm. Since Isobel Campbell left, so did the darker elements. Still worth seeing though    
			
			Atari Teenage Riot are playing @ Salzhaus, Winterthur 21.05.2011:

			Noise fans,  is playing tomorrow (sun March 6th, 9pm), in Geneva, at  .    
I was curious myself, saw this performer from New Zeland 3 days ago in Prague and he blew my mind. Plus, he is a really cool dude, high school prof on his sabatical touring the world with his musical mission. He is quite big in his field, so far on this tour he has played in UK, Scandinavia, CZ, FR, after CH he is going to Japan. Just a note for the gentle souls amongst us, bring ear plugs (just in case the sound guy sucks  ).    
It's short and sweet, very intense and a ton of dizzy fun. We are going.
		     
Wow...just checked out the Gurtenfestival...many bands I like!

Shoegaze-y, girl-group-y pop, garage rock-y, grunge-y goodness.
		 
			
			Yes please.           that sounds really good, shame I missed it.
		 
			
			Lloyd Cole small ensemble 13th April at Restaurant Viadukt.
		    Actually, it was awesome....The Geneva performance better than in Prague, then, Cave 12 threw a gig yesterday -  and  also quite obscure noise, I am sorry I have missed those 2.    
But, were very lucky to have Campbell Kneale of  on our couch past few days, weeheee...a lot of interesting talk.    
Check out Cave12 in Geneva, it's a fantastic project, loads of gigs are in  , an experimental culture place, I think it used to be a squat, unsurprisingly. I love the venue, nice people, guests and staff. Cave12 are great, too. Very approachable, I want to gig with them, when we finally put sh...t together.

2 Day music festival in Basel - April 1st and 2nd. Figures we are in scotland that weekend for a 2 day music festival in Edinburgh but anyone else looking for live music (indie, etc...) in little venues should consider going!!   
I've been to a couple of the venues and they were great (summer casino, kaserne) and have seen The Kapoolas and really liked them.   
Oh and Shelia she loves you!!  Very good local Basel band!
		 
			
			I've got the following gigs lined up: the human league, swans and qotsa at the bad kilbi bonn festival, earth, cyndi lauper, marianne faithful, belle and sebastian but I'm most looking forward to seeing Earth
		 
			
			John Mellencamp will attend live at sunset jul.13 th, bob dylan will play in sursee 
jun 24th 
3 doors down will play at jun 14th at the volkshaus zurich
		 
			
			lyle Lovett plays at kaufleuten jul 17th, good charlotte plays at komplex 457 
aug 04th
		 
			
			Flexing my urban muscle, Frauenfeld 2011:   
Snoop Dogg, Lil Wayne, Cypress Hill, Wyclef Jean, The Roots, Taio Cruz, Ice Cube, Black Star (Mos Def and Talib Kweli), M.O.P, Public Enemy....to name a few.   
Sounds like a hot ticket
		 
			
			for the same customers(frauenfeld) is the festival in wohlen (Touch the air), june 23th to 26th with timabland, akon, ludacris, busta rhymes to name a few     
			
			British band The Brew playing the Galery Music Bar near Z7 in Pratteln tomorrow night        Yes that looks a great line-up. Underworld are amazing live, and been wanting to see 2ManyDJs live for a long time. 
I'll hopefully be able to spend the whole weekend there.     
And for this weekend (Sat 2nd April): Kings Of The Jungle @ Komplex Zürich:        
			
			Another reminder for my mates awesome Rock'nRoll April events at Sedel, Luzern, stoner/pysch/desert/doom rock.   Different concerts on the 3rd, 8th, 21st(22nd is a holiday btw, so you can stay out late) and the 23rd of April, see   for details.       
Sedel is a great venue for these bands, I just wish it was a little closer to town.  Shuttle busses do run every half hour I think and only cost a tip for the driver.
		 
			
			Also, just seen   and   are playing Stall 6 in Zurich on the 2nd of April.  Loving whatever that scene is, electronic hip hop beats, monster bass and synths.  Their albums are well worth a listen if you don't mind a bit of the electronic).   
Edit : FFS, Young Gods play Sedel on the same night, and it's a friends birthday, damn.
		 
			
			The line-up for the Palèo Festival has just been announced - The National, PJ Harvey, Portishead, Beirut, The Strokes, Anna Calvi, The Chemical Brothers and more...               
			
			Filter at Abart on 22 June       there are some fine acts playing there but mainly during the week and I've got to work!    
			
			Best thing about Paleo, for me, has always been the discovery of acts I would've never seen otherwise...  &   come to mind in recent memory
		 
			
			Don't forget! Belle and Sebastian @ X-Tra ZH next Wednesday 13.04.11 Perfect indie pop - herbaceous borders, foxes, cups of tea etc etc            
Filter are phenomenal live, I saw them at a festival when Richard Patrick got nailed in the head with waterbottle. Didn't miss a beat right at the corus of 'Hey Man Nice Shot'.   
Crowd went berzerk! Sick mosh pit. I never knew 'Take a Picture' could be such a heavy song.   
Gonna hit up this show up for sure.
		 
			
			José González & The Göteborg String Theory are playing tomorrow (Friday 8th April) at Salzhaus Winterthur.       
Anyone else going as well?
		   Ben Howard is playing at the Caribana Festival in Crans-près-Céligny on 11th June:           Has anyone been to this small Festival?

I feel like some music        
Concert is tonight. Should be really good

			Tuesday July 5th    - X-tra     
			
			I heard that next thursday Beardyman is playing @ Stall6 for around 20CHF. If you get the chance check out his essential mix from this year (or last..... can't remember...). Basically beat-box's the entire thing while looping over himself beat-boxing.    
Its like the musical form of Inception
		 
			
			Slash plays JUL 13th at the KOmplex 
Rise Against plays Aug 23rd at the xtra 
Josh Groban plays at the KKL Luzern Oct 06 th

			Owen Pallett's playing in Fribourg this evening.
		    This looks quite interesting indeed, thanks for that.

			Sonisphere 2011 / 23 - 24 June, 2011 / Basel St. Jakob       
Line Up Thursday:               
Line Up Friday:                                                             
Already have my tickets for friday.             How was it? I wanted to go but didn't want to put up with the pain of getting back to Zürich - I had things to do on Saturday.
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this before but Raul Midon will be playing in Zurich at Moods on 10th May. Tickets available   priced at CHF38.   
This guy is brilliant        
			
			Atari Teenage Riot are playing at Salzhaus, Winterthur, 21.05.11           
Minus a member, right?
		    Yeah there's just 3 of them on tour - Alec Empire, Nic Endo, and MC CX KiDTRONiK, I think. Carl Crack OD'd in 2001.
		 
			
			Sheffield band   are playing @ Stall 6, ZH next Wednesday 18.05.11         (ps. I've got some free tix if anyone wants them, check the 'Free Stuff' section)   
			
			Holy Sh!t!   
Wilco are coming to Basel on 7th November - playing the Kaserne   
Also the Wild Beasts are playing on the river in Basel on 11th August.   
Awesome!!!
		 
			
			Cat's Eyes (Faris Badwan of The Horrors, and Canadian opera singer Rachel Zeffira) are playing at Hafenkneipe, ZH, on Thursday 26.05.11, kind of dark girl group pop with goth undertones. Watch their debut performance at the Vatican (of all places!):       
			
			anyone else going to einstürzende neubauten tomorrow and on thursday in lausanne? i'm SO looking forward to it! if i manage to get there in time that is...   
			
			A while away yet, but awesome Kiwi band   are playing at Abart, ZH, Thurs. 08 September 2011. I saw them at the m4m festival this year and they almost blew the roof off Exil.
		 
			
			Cut Copy + Architecture in Helsinki @ Stall 6, ZH, 28.06.11 - so I will get to see AiH this year after all    
			
			Grandmaster Flash at Stall 6, Zürich, Saturday May 28, 22.00
		    Getting back home was the expected long, drawn-out, sleepy saga, but it was worth it. Cinema-gig with the band sitting on stage in front of the screen, ripping into their instruments, while videos played behind, it was pretty unique. The band hung around before and after and had beers with the masses too, nice blokes.
		 
			
			DJ Shadow at Komplex Zurich on 04.06   
and Arcade Fire at Montreux Jazz Festival on 10th July!!          I try and go every year, will be there all 4 days this time. If you like old school 90s hip hop they usually have a big name one evening or another. The rest is either French Pop / Reggae (so many hippies in NE) / usually decent electro and some kids singer on the Sunday afternoon which is when the families are there.    
  It was really crowded last year, I hope it'll be better organised (more bars, less VIP space) so getting drinks doesn't take half an hour. There's load of benches and what not so sit down on and it's by the lakeside so you can smoke by the rocks if you want. Thing of it as a Fete Des Vendanges you have to pay an entrance to and that has decent music. Well worth it... so long as it doesn't rain too much, but most of the place is covered by tents anyway.
		 
			
			Too bad I am not here!  
The  in Winterthur (15 min by train from Zürich!) is on in June, they have concerts from June 10-12th.               
ENJOY         playing Zürich 30th June
		 
			
			Anyone wanna join me in the Rote Fabrik to see Slim Cessna's Auto Club. Some band members from 16 Horsepower, in the theme of American folkrock, kinda.       
			
			Simian Mobile Disco playing Nordstern in Basel on Friday night and Cut Copy playing Hinterhof on 29th. Really looking forward to both.
		 
			
			CEREMONY is playing on the 28th of july in Dynamo in Zürich:

Together with:   
TOXIC HOLOCAUST 
TRAP THEM 
WOLVES LIKE US
		 
			
			Destroyer is playing Rote Fabrik on the 24th of June. His last album out-80s the 80s, and if the live show is anywhere near as batshit-bizarre as this video, it should be interesting.       
			
			Lenny Kravitz  at the Hallenstadion Nov.26 th  
Flogging Molly at the Komplex 457 Nov.17 th 
The Kooks at Komplex 457 Oct.26 th
		 
			
			the Cat Empire are playing at Komplex on the 12th November (tix on sale on the 29th June)
		    Yes - did I miss it?     
Can't believe I've only just found this thread    
			
			Just got back from seeing Filter at Abart. It was AWESOME! It's quite surreal seeing bands that I grew up listening to.  Back in the Republic of South Africa, it's a dream come true to see bands like this.  I'm very grateful to be able to have these experiences and see these band that I admire and really love.
		 
			
			Sebadoh at Abart in Zürich on August the 15th. Grungey!       
			
			Just happened to notice Fleet Foxes are playing at Komplex 457 on 21.11...some way off yet I know! As much as I like their albums I'm not sure about seeing them live - anyone seen them before?
		 
			
			^ I haven't seen Fleet Foxes before, but I'll be there.   
also, awesome aussies cloud control are playing at hafenkneipe 19.09.11. great band, lovely people.
		    Not quite my thing but very good live, I've heard.
		 
			
			Switzerland has its fair share of good gigs!!!      always has a good line up.   
And the Red Hot Chili Peppers are playing in Zurich before they even come to the UK!!!! Dec 13th at Hallenstadion!
		 
			
			The Dub Pistols are playing in Fribourg tomorrow night, 2nd July, as part of Fribourg Jazz Parade. Don't really know much about them, but sound right up my street.          Generally regarded as having given a very weak performance at Glasto last weekend.
		 
			
			Manic Street Preachers are playing at the Winterthurer Musikfestwochen on Sunday 28.08.11:          @ Plaza, ZH, 01.11.11. Tickets  .
		 
			
			11.10.2011 - Beady Eye @ Volkshaus, Zurich 
Tickets are going on sale tomorrow ( )
		 
			
			Not Zürich but definately worth the trip - The Antlers play St. Gallen 3rd December.
		 
			
			Some bands work much better in a venue then at a festival. Actually most bands do.       
			
			Hi we're just moving down from Lux in Sept and in the past few weeks have seen Foals, PJ Harvey - Prince played here etc etc. There is a good music scene here and it's advertised of 2 main websites, is that the case in Zurich or Switz as a rule? 
Thanks
		    Arse - back in the UK then. The last album was a corker .... back to the old form
		    Sunday August 14 - Zofingen - Heitere Open Air Festival
		    It's ok. There's a lot of bands that don't come. As Far as I'm aware PJ and Foals have never been.
		    PJ plays Paleo I believe, this weekend. And I'll miss her       Tickets available on ricardo if you want them.    
I'm just going to pretend that I meant Zürich.
		    Nope ... Foals played at Abart last year. Zurich is not that bad after all       I didn't say i was bad, just ok! I'll revise my opinion when Radiohead come and play on their next tour.
		    damn, only one Swiss date??    
Will you be seeing them on the UK leg of their tour DP?
		    I am going to see them in Hastings.  Just a few minutes walk from my house

			Zurich: Wednesday 17th August   
PRINCE!!       
There are no more standing tickets left from ^ that ticket link, but I found mine from a UK website
		 
			
			The concert from prince in cologne arena was absolut rubbish, he played 
one song, left the stage for 50 mins, returned for anonther 65 mins and left 
early after a total of 75 mins played, some people payed about 150 euros for a seat.         That's a shame. He's usually one of the best live acts out there (imo) 
I hope he'll not be doing the same in Zurich
		 
			
			Friendly Fires will definitely be worth a look....   
Sadly I won't be able to make it - but I recommend   (Abart, 8th Sept)

			Great baltimore duo Wye oak are playing at Fri-Son, Fribourg 10.11.11 (sadly no ZH show   )              they're playing geneva too on the 7th. thanks for the heads up.
		     
Saw them a couple of years ago at that very spot.  Was very, very loud, we got very drunk, one mate got into a fight in the mosh pit and was almost thrown out, another ended up sleeping under a mattress in a squat somewhere in Zurich.
		 
			
			I'd like to recommend the songkick.com website, it's brilliant. 
It scans your iTunes library or you can quickly and easily choose the interests that interest you as well as the cities and you have a personalized calendar and receive emails when concerts of interest are announced.
		 
			
			Brilliant !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		     
This is spam but the songkick iOS app is pretty good.
		                i'll be there! in lausanne as well!  )

 Tickets went on sale this morning...I got mine at starticket      
V excited...though I might get over that by January       I've heard the Spice Girls are reforming, maybe that's more to your tastes?

			Not so much a Heads-up, more of an ""Oh Bollocks"", but did anyone catch the Buzzcocks in Aarau last Saturday? Any good? I missed it as I was in the UK.        Saw them last year when the played Zug OpenAir (free festival) it was nice to say I'd seen them but tbh they were nothing special at all.

			For all you Vaud jazzers,   is coming to Chorus, Lausanne, 15 October 201, with his Migration band.  This is a musician/drummer not to be missed if you can make the gig.  Reservations will be necessary, I am sure.   
Antonio has many projects, but those of you in the know will recognize him as Pat Metheny's drummer in his PMG (Pat Metheny Group), the drummer since 2003.       
This is a big musician coming to Lausanne.

		    Too bad Trap Them was cancelled for this show   They now got replaced by The Secret
		 
			
			Blue October are coming to Z-7 in Pratteln BL on 19 November.  I saw them once in Boston and it was a good show.  Too bad i am not in Basel then to see them again.

			Brit Bobby Long is playing on October 16 at Laborbar in Zurich at 20:00.  It will be a great show by a super talented artist!  If anyone's interested in going, let me know!   is his website if you want to check out his music....
		 
			
			Perhaps this could be interesting for some people: the people from the Kilbi festival in Düdingen/Bad Bonn will launch something like a   in winter - 9th/10th December in Exil (and Moods) Zurich.   
Particularly looking forward to Glenn Branca Ensemble and Thurston Moore. It's a little pricey (85.- for both days), though it's worth it for me.
		    presents  .   
The concert will be held on  at  , at   in Burgweg 7, 4058 Basel.   
You can buy tickets for 24 CHF through  ,  , at SBB and Post. Or you can buy it at the venue for 26 CHF from 21h on the night of the gig.   
The concert itself starts at 22h, but there will be a party at around midnight with DJ Edin and DJ Bob Rock playing Balkan/electro music.   
Kultur Shock plays some sort of Balkan music/rock/metal/punk fusion, and they are particularly good live. Well see for yourselves:       
and the same track live at exitfest 2010 in Novi Sad, Serbia:       
Great huh?! }:-) 
See you there!
		 
			
			Don't forget: British Sea Power are playing at the Abart, ZH this Wednesday 12.10.11. They had to cancel their ZH show twice before, so fingers crossed they'll make it this time!           
			
			pretty much my reaction too, with an few choice expletives thrown in though. I did regain my composure long enough to selflessly post it here, thinking it might help some deserving music fan out that way catch them.          Good concert, though I was pretty drunk. Place seemed to empty by the end of the gig, shame really, but as their last album was their worst so far then I'm not surprised.
		 
			
			Just got my Tickets for   at Stall 6, 6th November.   
For techno heads, Richie Hawtin is playing as  , Komplex 457, 22nd October.

			Saharan blues from Tinariwen at Kaufleuten in Zurich on Saturday 15th October. If you've not heard them live and like riddim then it's the concert for you. A major influence on so many records recently.   
I happen to have two tickets for this show for sale at cost price  .       
			
			Has it sold out? I was considering it but won't decide until Saturday. I'll post again on sat just in case you haven't sold them.
		 
			
			Glasgow-based band   are playing at Papiersaal, ZH, on Wednesday 19.10.11. I'm liking them a lot lately, and I reckon they'll be great:         (I've also got some free tix if anyone wants them: http://wp.me/pLHpb-1i4)   
			
			The Italian electro-rock band   is visiting Basel.   
The gig is starting at 21h on 30th of October in Grenzwert bar (Rheingasse 3, in Kleinbasel).      to their profile with more of their work.   
And a small glimpse on what you might expecting a few weeks:     
So if you feel like changing your Swiss routine, you can start by going out on Sunday evenings as well. }:-)   
See you there!
		 
			
			Not my kind of music - normally, but they have some catchy pop songs which put you in a good mood. Swiss - German music   - in English.

Dropkick Murphys , Feb 04 th Komplex 457 , Zurich
		    We rarely read reviews after the event on this thread, so I'll keep it brief: It was very good   Support act François & The Atlas Mountains had some interesting beats but strange, Eno-esque dance moves, which were a bit theatrical, but in all very West Coast French dance melancholia. Anna Calvi's voice is a joy to hear. Nuff said.   
Oh Hai GastroGnome! I tried to grab ya but you had more beauties surrounding you than I did, so I didn't want to steal your thunder       I was there too! I'll be writing a review soon (on my blog, though, will post a link), just haven't had a moment. We should do a meet up at the next suitable gig, what do you think?

might be worth a drive from lausanne but the tuesday night thing is a killer.
		 
			
			A bumper week for music in ZH next week! Obviously getting to all of them may involve some kind of cloning technology   but here are my tips:       
			
			I'd love to say The Kills were great last night, but due to the   sound at X-tra, it's hard to say.    
Not the first time either - I'm not going to waste my hard earned on that venue anymore.
		     Were you upstairs or downstairs?   
I find if you are right in the middle upstairs the sound is not so bad.

			Sisters of mercy (chf 55) and its at xtra in zurich. Date 23rd November 2011   
I've got a spare ticket for the above   
If you're interested please pm me
		 
			
			looking forward for the sisters of mercy tomorrow and on thursday! can't believe i have never seen them before!    
next days' schedule:     
tomorrow: work, drive to zürich, gig, drive back 
thursday: train to lausanne, work, gig, sleep 
friday: drive back, work 
saturday: drive to zürich, vive la fete gig 
sunday: drive back, probably spend day on sofa 
monday: work, drive to zürich, fakir's gig, drive back ?   
why do all the bands chose to play at the same time and almost never in bern??
		    I was bang in the middle, about a foot behind the sound desk. Logically I would have thought the best place for sound in the venue...       yes,that is normally the best spot  . Try upstairs next time if you can.
		    price negotiable, if anyone is interested
		    mhm, the last time when there was paul kalkbrenner, sound was fine?!  
same with belle & sebastian and morcheeba.
		 
			
			sisters of mercy gig at the xtra was pretty good but the sound quality was terrible, more due to xtra than the sisters. not the first time a gig has been ruined for me at the xtra due to useless sound quality
		 
			
			Right, don0t know what the problem there is. The second half of the gig was much better.          Skindred are an awesome band - saw them at Download a couple of years back.  DK Murphies are a must see too - saw them in boston last year.
		 
			
			anyone going to any of these?   
the horrors - tomorrow night 
smashing pumpkins - next fri 2nd dec 
dEUS - next sat 3rd dec 
thurston moore - sat after 10th dec   
im new to town (zurich) but will be headinbg to these gigs, so feel free to say hi!   
(especially if you know where i can buy vimto...)
		 
			
			I'll be at the Horrors tonight, gimme a shout if you want to meet up. I know of a few Asian stores in Oerlikon which sell Vimeo that I can give you directions for ^^
		 
			
			sounds good       i'll most probably be at the dEUS one! and also at dEUS in neuchatel on the 6th     
thurston moore, i thought i was going but it's on the same date as FAQ's gig in Aarau   
and i think i'm probably going there, as the partying will surely be better!    
i had some friends seeing smashing pumpkins in london a few weeks ago and they were very disappointed (and they are pretty big fans). so i'm not going (to be fair, i wouldn't go anyway as i'm not crazy about them)   
we seem to like similar music, so feel free to come and say hi tomorrow at Fakir's show in kaffi für dich (details a few posts above).
		 
			
			Hi Crimson, I'll see I will see about monday night, tho i tend to work late at the moment. I'll def be at dEUS tho, my fav band! That should be ace. it woul dbe good to go to the show on the 6th as well but, work!   
Shame to hear your friends didnt like the pumpkins recently, i had friends at copenhagen, manchester and london gigs and they were nothing but loving the shows. they are the band that usually suprise me most at shows with how amazing they are, but i shall see!
		 
			
			i hope you will enjoy the sp show! let us know!    
dEUS are perfect. every time i see them i can't get over how great they are. and they are not even my favourite band! (but amongst the top ones anyway)

The Musical Box is a highly professional canadian Genesis tribute band. They bring the early Genesis years - when Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett were still in the band - back to life. They recreate their vintage shows as original as possible. The sounds, the sights, the costumes, the lights, the everything. They are very approved by the original band. Phil Collins even played a show or two with them. This time they will play the ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"" show in its entirety. It's rumoured that original Genesis guitarist   will join them for the encores!

That's the original price. I will not charge any postal delivery costs but require payment in advance, preferably paypal. I would send them out immediately after having received the money.

while I had my head in the books studying for exams I forgot to do something very important (buy Noel Gallagher tickets at Komplex 457). Now they have sold out and I am kicking myself(!).

hoo.   
CHF300.- gone. just. like. that.                  I've got tickets for wilco, earth, bruce springsteen and mastodon. I am thinking of seeing the tindersticks (brilliant in geneva in 2010, good in zurich in 2011) and lambchop. I saw lambchop a few years ago in the rote fabrik and they were dreadful, the band was sloppy, the crowd got bored and people started to go home. they must have had a fight because there was lots of banter between them which didn't involve the audience. this was promoting the damaged album.
		    I was at that gig: it was US Independence Day. Talking backstage with them during the interval Kurt and MacManus were talking about being TourBlind: it was getting tired and no longer personal. They wanted to be with their families, especially on that night. After a peace pipe, they came back on and played some haunting stuff, which many didn't enjoy, as you note. The banter was down to, er, the pipe, me thinks.   
Crap jokes were still crap, though. Can't wait to see them again.
		 
			
			for any Radiohead fans out there..

Glass Swords is one of the best albums of last year, though TBH, the appeal may not be immediately obvious.
		    Thanks for this old advice Jimmy Bee! I did not make the concert last year but went tonight to see him at Moods, he was playing with his Primitive Horn Orchestra...       Yes, brilliant music. But their concerts should be black and white.
		    Haha! So true....      - are you sure you are ""working"" out of the country for three months? Pretty sure me and Prof T saw you playing the drums last night in the Primitive Orchestra!

For anyone who hasn't heard this Canadian gem, they are highly acclaimed and having seen them in concert back in Manitoba, they are amazing live.           Hello and welcome to the Forum. You can post concert events on the mysteriously invisible*   or under   ( if you're a promoter or financially involved).   
Putting a concert / event on the calendar gives it greater exposure and allows for some 'buzz' (is this what the kids call it these days?).   
Also, you can set up a  . This particular thread can be hard work to get overview, so lead from the front!

			The Concerts calendar is now added to the Events menu - thanks Editor Bob.    
As it's tricky getting overview of posts made in this thread perhaps consider adding a concert to the concerts calendar if you intend going as this may encourage others and it'll build our social opportunities.

I have never met an actual fan of this band.   
I'm sure they have some, but are probably too embarrassed to admit it. I don't blame them.
		   They've sold over 50 million albums, allegedly
		 
			
			I've been wanting to see Mazzy Star for years but alas I'm on holiday that day!
		 
			
			the song about the panties down by the ankles is cringeworthy

			here's a great video with all the wikipedia 'updates' on Nickelback over the years.     
Some are very informative and amusing            
I guess I'll be dancing alone then           Canada has enough awesome music.    
Nickelback is just the Canadian reaction to Creed.

			Looking forward to RPWL at the Galery Music Bar in Pratteln this evening:       
Although the Z-7 crew are promoting and selling tickets, the venue is the Galery just down the road, not the Z-7 black hall.   
RPWL started life as a Pink Floyd covers band, but they've had their own progressive style for more than a decade now, their latest CD ""Beyond Man and Time"" is very good melodic rock.
		    I'd go just to see Janelle Monae. She's amazing
		    I like the line-up but can't understand why it's called Montreux ""Jazz"". Been to Cully last weekend, much jazzier there and a fantastic atmosphere.
		 
			
			Would love to see Tony Bennett but tickets are very expensive
		    I guess it's kind of hard to change the name midride.... and much of nowadays music is influenced by jazz (the good stuff at least)
		 
			
			Eagles of Death Metal are playing in Solothurn on the 21st of June.           
Nothing remarkably new or mindblowingly good, but never fail to entertain live. I'd go just to see Jesse Hughes do his little dance.

Tickets are on sale at   for a WHOPPING 78,60 plus the print at home fee makes it an 80 CHF ticket... I don't get why they charge us to print out the ticket at home.. that should be free right?   
			
			Quite a treat: starting on Friday, 16th November at the Reitschule in Bern is the   festival, celebrating 15 years of Constellation Records. Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Do Make Say Think, and A Silver Mt. Zion, amongst others.       Godspeed also in Zürich's Rote Fabrik for 35chf

			The Tindersticks ( ) and the Maccabees ( ) are playing in Fri-Son in November. Don't realy know a great deal about either band, but will have a butchers at YouTube and might pop along to one or the other.   
Edit: Sorry, had wrong dates.
		          The Tindersticks are a brilliant band, check out their second album with this cover (   and Curtains:   
The music is melancholic, moody, orchestral   
They can be brilliant live especially when they have their string and horn sections in tow.   
I fully recommmend them and good luck!
		    Thanks for the heads-up on this @Crumbs.  Can't wait!    
			
			What is it with the XTRA venue in Zürich?The sound quality is truly dreadful. I have seen several live bands there and I have always noticed the poor sound quality. Only the supremely organized or very loud acts seem to be able to overcome the poor sound quality of this venue.
		 
			
			Thanks PaddyG, I've been wanting to see the Maccabees for years :-). Seen Tindersticks, not really my bag.       
			
			I'll be going to:

			I've got tickets for Fleetwood Mac on 13-10-2013 at the (wretched) Hallenstadion in Zurich and I'm really excited about seeing Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie and the two lucky guys
		    There have been rumours about (no pun intended  ) that Christine McVie may also appear on the tour
		    I'm glad to hear it but I thought she'd retired completely, she really has to sing her songs, Stevie Nicks has too country a voice to sing Christine's songs imho. I'm also really looking forward to seeing Buckingham, a seriously underrated guitarist, play

They are appearing at Z7 in Pratteln on May 9th.     
This as a trailer to their debut album 'Dimensionaut'.  It should appeal to all prog. rock fans.          Thanks for the heads up. Saw them last night at the Stadthalle in Sursee. It was just like it would be to see the real Pink Floyd playing in a high school basketball gym. Fantastic!

I'm finally going to get to see one of my favourite bands!    
			
			Nouvelle Vague play Kaserne in Basel on 2nd October. I have my tickets :-)           
btw what did you think of the gig? I wasn't impressed, I saw her last year in Geneva and she way way better
		    strange, i was also last year in geneva and did not enjoy it very much. i thought she was in a bad mood, whereas in zürich she was in a good mood   
i really liked the one in zürich and the one in montreux a couple of weeks later. still have the songs in my head. gotta love her.
		    i'm going as well! and to another place they're playing, could it be geneva? (yes too lazy to check)    
i've seen them live a few times already and i'm always impressed by the energy they bring on stage. much better than the cds in my opinion. you will love it!
		    Oh! I thought I might be the only one from here that would be interested. Maybe with the exception of Prof T.   
I saw Red Sky Coven a few years ago, but haven't managed NMA yet. Really looking forward to it.
		    exciting, isn't it?   see you there!    
			
			Fat Freddy's Drop, in Zurich 21st October

		    god they were incredibily shit live 3 years ago at the kaufleuten. they sound like a local schoolband doing covers, far from their fab CD productions.

			For country fans, Band Perry will be in concert in Zurich at   on the 23rd of November.  Warm-up acts (not listed here) are:  Easton Corbin and a a dynamite guitar player from Canada, Lindsay Ell (her mentor was Randy Bachman of BTO).
		 
			
			I don't get the nouvelle vague love, for me its money for old rope.
		    well, some versions have a bit of fresh new paint to it or sound interesting though i am not a big fan. just got a ticket from a friend, so i just 'been there'. what i like about them is the nice singing voice of the girl that wasnt there at kaufleuten and therefor (sorry, lou) were rather like a fly buzzing around my head...
		 
			
			vive la fete are playing in bern this coming saturday. woop!        
			
			Hi guys, been lucky enough to follow some of the greatest bands around just before they ""made it"" (luck and friends, not me). Went to see this Swiss band absolutely amazing and a brilliant punctuation to my move to Sydney. I think Domi should be big and I mean BIG       This got good around the five minute mark.  Sounds like what would happen if you put Thom Yorke and the XX in the same room.
		    Really cool music but my god what a shocking voice. They really need a new singer...        You have a good point...Not everyone can be this guy:       
			
			Anyone going to see Lucero on September 18?
		    I gotta see her live one of these days, can't believe I have missed her so many times. Did she do Nude on the News?
		    nope, unfortunately! according to my catpower expert boyfriend (and kind of friend of hers) she refuses to play it
		    I can't have too much of her all the time, a bit too dramatic but Nude on the News is one of my all time favs, really. She is so spontaneous and talented. I hung with folks who went to see her a lot in Atlanta.
		    i cannot have too much of her at once as well. but i like her more and more as the years go by
		 
			
			So I went to see Nouvelle Vague on Wednesday night, the sound quality of the band was not so good but the singing was perfectly fine and the entertainment factor was excellent. Over all a great night out and a lot of fun; I would go and see them again.           maybe because her song is called Nude as the News... see! Catpower loves me more than you!    
			
			After skipping out on most of the festival scene this summer, I'm excited to see The Dirty Head and the iconic Sublime (with Rome) on Nov. 12 at Haerterei. Great show for those who enjoy the punk/ska/reggae cali scene.           
			
			Rude Zone Festival at Dynamo, Zurich, November 1st:     
with BAD MANNERS and RED SOUL COMMUNITY, ++support           
			
			Sea Sick Steve @ Komplex on the 2nd Nov. is gonna be great.    
			
			Has a spare ticket for Sea Sick on Saturday, worth 38.- will sell for 30.- send me a PM.
		 
			
			I'm going to the following shows in Zurich; if anyone wants to join on the end then you're more than welcome to get the first beers in.     play the Viadukt Bogen F; Thursday 7th November, 21:00, CHF35.-          (Sold Out but worth a visit for the Abend Kasse option) @ Rote Fabrik Friday 8th November, supported by Zurich group  ; well worth an early arrival. CHF28.-          plays Exil, Thurs. 14th Nov, CHF25.-         play the Rote Fabrik, 20:30, Thurs 21st Nov. CHF30.-        play the Rote Fabrik, Weds 20th Nov. 20:30 CHF25.- - an absolute snip!          plays the Rote Fabrik, Thurs. 5th. Dec 20:30 CHF25.-

			Kasabian @ Hallenstadion on 4th November   
Incidentally, how do Ticketcorner justify this, any ideas?   
Ticketcorner: 
Kasabian, standing ticket: CHF 67 + CHF 3.50 fee for print at home = 70.50 
Starticket: 
Kasabian, standing ticket: CHF 63 + CHF 1.20 fee for print at home = 64.20   
Same ticket, same order but 6 francs difference?

		    Bad bonn kilbi is the best featival ever! In the middle of nowhere....highly recommended! I cannot go this year (getting married that weekend) but i cannot stress enough what a cool festival it is! 
Ps: if you go make sure to walk to the nearby lake and enjoy the beauty of thr scenery
		     
oh wow The Black Angels too! AND Mac Demarco!
		 
			
			Just seen the line up for Monteux Jazz 2015 and I don't think there is any artist that particularly stands out.  Perhaps they are keeping the best for next year as it will be the 50th one       
			
			thanks for the heads up, some good acts playing like Ibeyi, Foxygen, The Staves, Portishead, Sophie Hunger, Lionel Richie, Kronos Quartet, James Blake, Sly and Robbie, Anna Calvi, Alt J, Santana, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, George Benson,  etc etc   
but some serious crap as well, there is very little quality control going on these days
		 
			
			i'd also recommend dEUS and asaf avidan
		    I missed this, I love the Sleaford Mods!   
Otherwise a weak line up. I saw Thurston Moore with Sonic Youth at BKB a few years ago and they were lame. Highlight were the mighty Sunn O)))   
@crimson, I fully agree BKB is a great festival with a great vibe
		 
			
			Thurston Moore solo, I would go see. It is different, especially if he is in the mood.    
dEus is amazing. And James Blake.    
I want to see all that       Thurston Moore has different moods? How can one tell?
		    The left corner of his lips is about 2mm above the right one?   
I know    
But I do like drony stuff that washes over. There's certain poetry in a wall of noise.    
Which reminds me, completely unrelated, I gotta wish for a uke for my bday that is coming up    
			
			Ed Sheeran - is he back anytime soon?

			recommended gigs in the VERY NEAR future (May) for Zurich:   
16.05: Dandy Warhols, Plaza (think of White Stripes with more fun)     
27.05: Porches, Klaus (from NYC - great fun)     
28.05: Dead Meadow, Club Zukunft (superb psych/garage band)     
29.05: Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Mascotte (surely no need to introduce them?)        anyway, they are a good band - very indie, if they come round again worth the trip.
		 
			
			Ezra Furman plays in Zurich tonight at Bogen F, 21:00.
		   play in Zurich at the  , 8th February.        
			
			I love them. ""Up with People"".   
Ezra Furman and his ""My Zero"" is MiniMC's ultimately fav song.
		    Doh! its the Missus's Birthday, oh well, I will just say its a surprise       Lambchop play Geneva the night before the Zurich gig; they play Luzern the night after.    
Ezra was ok the other night but the crowd seemed more happy to be there than enjoy being there, but that's the Swiss concert experience. He seemed tired.
		    I find that infuriating, in Zürich its about being seen at a concert but with absolutely no interest in the music! I am always telling people to stfu especially during quieter songs, when it seems the gig becomes a social gathering. The amount of times I have heard performers saying something about that during a performance, I don't think the Zürich audience gets it!    
			
			sooooo true....
		 
			
			Great thread. Any hint of U2 coming back...sadly passed us by last time (from a fans point of view that is).
		    It will be better when people start caring more for content than form. Being seen may also translate as liking the music, privately, you cannot expect a discrete culture all of a sudden show authentic affection in a prestigeous environment. The fact that the musicians and loads of listeners do not consider it prestigeous (the partisan opposite) is irrelevant.    
Les Grottes are great; in GE. Anti prestigeous. Weird enough stuff.
		    Lead from the front: dancing and enjoying yourself is the perfect way to get your square metre of space and will encourage the others. I was, however, told off by a woman once at a Nicolas Jaar gig for dancing. I apologised and told her next time I wanted to have fun I'd stay at home and listen on my headphones. Some just can't abide happiness in others.
		     
Hahahah. I am used to lead from the stage   , the best kind of hedonistic leadership.    
Well - I agree with you. There are places that support actual fun. And I also think that people do not dance for the same reason other stuff doesn't get done here, worried about spontaneity/authenticity being perceived as impolite, rude.    
I dance when I feel like it. Gigs, classrooms, balet halls, tents. I think the stiffness will change. A buddy of mine went to headphones party (4 diff music channels), she had to look for somebody dancing to the same stuff. Fun. And some rooms had no light. Gasp! Puritanism is on its way out of life.

			DARK FUNERAL, NEGURA BUNGET, INDIGEN     
ELUVEITIE, KORPIKLAANI, EXCELSIS, BLUTMOND, POWERWOLF   
Should be a blast since Dark Funeral just got a new line up and Eluveitie wants to make this Folk Metal concert a regular thing. Other notable bands I think may go down well with people into this music would be:     
			
			I'll go to Arch Enemy & Eluveitiefest    
			
			Cool to know. I'm going to the Eluveitiefest too (and Dark Funeral).
		 
			
			Hey Xamarth, thank for this post.   
I am new to Basel, and want to know about Metal concerts in the area.   
Also, do you know a good place in Basel to buy Metal cds?
		 
			
			thanks for posting this, I don't know these bands but am a black metal fan   
My current favourite genre is drone, my favourite band being Sunn o))) who draw some inspiration from black metal.     , another top drone band, are playing Lausanne in March 2012
		    Hi Vinni and welcome.   
You need to know about Z-7, just down the road in Pratteln.       
They have a pretty good range of metal gigs, as well as rock, hard rock and other forms of music. They have a decent 4-day festival on in June too.   
Every now and then there are very underground metal gigs in the basement of the Hirscheneck pub in Kleinbasel. These gigs are very small.         
For metal all around Switzerland, check out this list.       
\m/   
PS And for CDs, I usually buy online, but Media Markt at the train station has some. For a better - and somewhat eclectic - selection in an interesting, chaotic environment, there's Atlantis records on Elisabethenstrasse, just down from the train station.
		 
			
			Hey Tantrum, thanks for your very useful reply!   
I see that there is a cool show lined up at the Hirscheneck in April:   
Sa 28.04.2012 
Türöffnung: 21.00 Uhr / Beginn: 22.00 Uhr 
Eintritt: 20,-/10,- (Kein Vorverkauf) 
Master [USA/CZ] 
Fleshless [CZ] 
Total Annihilation [CH]   
Also there are some good shows lined up at the Z-7. 
I see that Amorphis is playing tomorrow night. 
Only problem is that the site is in German and I don't see an option to change to English! 
What does this note mean:   
Info: Tickets nur noch über VVK-Stellen oder Abendkasse.   
I will check out the cd stores that you mentioned.   
As for online shopping, what sites do you usually use?
		    No, there's not much English on the website. The note means that you can no longer pre-order the tickets through the website. You can either get them from ticket outlets or from the ticket office at the door on the night. Here's the list of ticket outlets       
Where it says ""Kanton auswählen"" at the top, choose ""Basel-Stadt"" and you can see some central places to get tickets. Unless there's some chance of selling out (and only Blind Guardian and Marillion have done so in the last year or so), you can get tickets on the night at the venue, where it costs about 6 CHF more than pre-purchase.   
That Hirscheneck 28 April gig looks pretty good. I imagine I'll be there. There have been some good gigs at Z-7 the last couple of months (Symphony X, Morbid Angel, Orphaned Land, Destruction/Exodus), but I haven't yet seen anything in 2012 that I'll go to, other than the Metalfest and Obituary in June. Drop me a PM if you want to catch up at a gig sometime (I won't be at Amorphis though).
		 
			
			Hi all. 
Just to add some more info about finding Metal shows - have a look at this website:    
I saw this website advertised in the Volkshaus when I went to the Eluveitie fest and it shows a lot of upcoming Metal shows such as Judas Priest, Die Apokalyptischen Reiter, Steel Panther, Mastodon, Tarja Turunen (ex-Nightwish) and if you like the more Rock/Nu-Metal scene then there is 3 Doors Down, Korn, Black Stone Cherry, and more.  
Check it out!     
ALSO!!! 
Anyone into Metal should know about the Sounddock 14 club. It's a small club (but very intimate) in Dietikon with a lot of great band performing regularly and a generally good atmosphere. You can buy CDs, merch, and sometimes ""Viking"" stuff like honey wine, drinking horns, etc. outside. Keep up with it at:      "	8	1	 Nov 2009	['30', '18']	METAL in Zurich: Folk & Black concerts in December!	Xamarth	122	2565	Concerts

			Magda is going to be at the Hive Club in Zürich on the 19th of November! I'm new to Switzerland and this will be my first night out. I'm excited! No idea what to expect though, but what I can count on is Magda will be laying down some solid techno and house choons, with a futuristic disco flavour.   
Anyone interested in going to this event with me?    
Have any info or tips about attending a night at Hive?   
Here's the link to the website for more info...       
And if you like dance music, but aren't familiar with Magda, you can download her latest podcast mix for XLR8R here. It'll give you an idea of how amazing this night could be!

			Hi! 
I wanted to attach your attention to this interesting festival:   
This kind of music is a bit rare, so I and my girlfriend are looking forward to it. It would by nice to meet somebody with same interests    
			
			Looks pretty wild!    
It was hard for me to tell: is this the ""modern classical"" kind of electronic music (Varèse, Stockhausen, Boulez, etc.) or ""electro"" dance music?   
I discovered at lunch time that I missed a concert of the minimalist composer Steve Reich's music in Geneva, yesterday. Gutting...
		 
			
			the music in first parts (Alhambra's concerts) is sometimes called just ""new music"". never mind the appellation - it can vary, it's something unusual and thus I like it  . The second parts in Zoo might be also suitable for dancing  .  
I bought tickets yesterday in Sounds (8 avenue du Mail, Geneve). It's a small pretty music store, lots of LPs, CDs. I didn't have time to check the stuff thoroughly, but it looked very promising. And it's open till 7pm. We could meet before the concerts if you or anybody else want to go too.   
About Reich, I am sorry, I would love to be at the concert! Please remember me and send me a PM if you find this kind of concert in the future..
		 
			
			I was there and it was amazing! Pieces presented in Alhambra were created and performed as multichannel spatial ""music"". Technical equipment of Alhambra was on very high level so the effect of spatial reproduction was enormous. I will not comment particular interprets since this would be subjective. In general I can say that concerts in Alhambra offered unique experience in terms of featured artists as well as quality of sound reproduction. If you like experimental electronic music, don't miss Presences Electroniques Geneve next year!

			If you are interested in going to the Opera but not paying the regular prices you can go to the ""Volksvorstellungen"". In the attached link you can see the program til July 2012. You can book tickets 1 month in advance.   
Tickets from CHF 15.- (limited view) to CHF 75.-. This is a bargain for Operas as normal tickets would cost aboout 4 times the price.        
If you are interested to visit the Opera on March 23th, Friday evening, to see Mozart's COSI FAN TUTTE with a group then PM me. Please tell me which category you would prefer and I will arrange tickets in February.    
Next Volksvorstellung is PALESTRINA from Pfitzner, Friday Dec. 30, 19.30h. Still tickets available.
		    yep, and if you are in a limited view seat you can keep your eyes open for empty seats in other areas and move there in the first break.   I used to do that sometimes and nobody ever complained.
		 
			
			Awesome, PM sent!

			and was VERY disappointed.   
The tickets said 8.00.  There was no band before Shakira.   
She came out at 9.30. No explanation for her tardiness. Despite the concert reviews, the crowd was not pleased. The bass was too strong.  The playback was of poor quality and you couldn't really hear Shakira's voice.  She changed all the songs to make them sound the same.  She didn't get the crowd going at all.  Many people left early.   
Yes, she is beautiful and she can move her body but for SFr 90, I expect to be entertained.
		 
			
			I was depressed for not being able to pay the 90 plus 100 of babysitting and I really sorry you had a bad experience, but i feel better for not going and saving a little bit.
		 
			
			I saw her this week in Zurich, and I had a good time. It was my first time seeing her live though, so I have no comparison to other performances from her, and I was perhaps also over-excited to see her live.   
It is true that she started late, after 9pm, but all of the concerts I have been to before always started between 1-2 hours late, so business as usual. I did find it weird that they did not have an opening band, as sometimes I have gotten to know cool new artists I wouldn't have otherwise known just because they were opening a big concert. However, her delay gave me and my friends the chance to catch up on each others' lives, recent and upcoming travels, etc. and drink a few glasses (too many) while waiting.   
I found the choreography, scene, and stage quite cool to be honest, I could hear her voice quite well above the music, and I could see her well from where we were.    
I do have a couple of complaints:  Other than that, it was cool. Not the best concert I've been at, but considering the excellent company and my love for the artist, not bad at all methink   
			
			So her Hips do lie...
		 
			
			I personally think that her singing sounds a lot like a cat being strangled, but thats only my opinion...
		    Before she was corrupted by Emilio Estefan, her concerts would have been less expensive and of better quality, and she would have started on time. 
The songs in her pre-USA days were also better.  Now she's just a plastic production.
		    I saw her in November at the Hallon Stadion and I thought she was great. I think she was more or less on time because she'd already started by the time I got in. The audience loved her - couple of encore's.   
The only thing I didn't like was the audience - adolecent young girls and a few letcherous older men. I wondered which category I belonged to....   
Guess everyone can have an off night, but it's bad she was late. Especially as most of her audience are 13.    
I have been to many concerts ruined by the quality of the mixing. Seems sound engineering is still an undeveloped science.   
I went because I really like her music and think she's really talented, not to letch at her succulant young body, although while I was there it would have been rude not to, so I did a bit.    
Have to admit her latest suff is a step down in quality though.
		 
			
			I like her Waka Waka . . .! even last one Whenever ! 
waiting for else . . .?   
			
			Shakira has to be the most overrated ""star"" out there.
		    I know all gringos love her though       Are you sure? I'm sure that the readers could put together a bunch of other candidates.   
Here are mine:   
Anyone from a TV talent show 
Stephan Eicher (because I simply can't stand his voice) 
Nickelback - an embarrassment to Canada 
Céline Dion - an embarrassment to Québec and a reason to throw them out of the rest of Canada 
Any reggae act - I'm not a fan
		    Not every Canadian act is bad.    I still smile when I hear this band:       
As for Justin Bieber, I'm too old to comment.
		    Hum.... the fact that she is a worldwide biggest artist says more than your very personal opinion of her success....   
As a Quebecoise I am Freaking proud of what she did. And like a hell lots of Canadians too.   
I guess you did much better while being much cooler...    
			
			Wasn't the Canadian government due to apologize for Céline Dion after doing the same for Bryan Adams (I want my early 90s back with all robin hood songs deleted)?    
 If you want ""decent"" Montreal stuff, try these nutters:    MOAR drugs!    
Oh and if you expect a decent show from playback artists, don't go out.
		    Come off it Nil. She's hardly the biggest anything. I'm sure madonna wouldn't be happy with that statement!
		 
			
			Rush and Neil Young redeem Canada for any crappy music they produce. Unattainable awesomeness.              As the man says. she is rubbish ... media hyped, talentless (unless wiggling yer arse is talent) - but nice eye candy.  Dreadful quality of songs and just awful lyrics   
So live, she showed her true self ...
		           
I believe Celine has nothing to envy to Madonna...             
I'm pretty sure she does. She can envy mariah Carey too while she's at it.   
I think the phrase you were looking for was one of the best selling artist.
		 
			
			Best selling, no matter how you spin it, has *nothing* to do with talent, period.
		 
			
			It has everything to do with whether you pay to se them 
Ps Celine is equally talentless .  All that air guitar playing  - and so badly   
Being canadian doesn't mean you transcend the taste detector!      No but I think it is pretencious to call someone talentless when sitting on his butt and certainly not showing how much better someone can do.   
Talentless is definitely overrate here.... Without mentioning that it is just a matter of opinions for what it is worthed...   
Which she certainly didn't build her billions on, but because she is good and people all over the world loved her.
		    In that case, don't listen to the below at full volume without a shirt on and save yourself 6 minutes      
Back on topic: forget about Shakira, she sits in my lap.
		    I have no idea what any of that means ... 
Celine may be ""loved"" by many ... in that luvie / showbiz sort of way  
But I bet those who can't stand her are a much greater number ...   
Anyway back to real talent ... 
Neil Young - the man who gave Canada credibility    
			
			Back OT: Shakira sucks
		    If only..........
		 
			
			PORSCHE!    
Wash   
Mouth   
Soap          Yes he should! I still gave him some rep to made me laugh out loud!       
			
			Well in mexico, to be more exact Yucatan now its the subject of the moment because the governor (sadly first time a woman rules a state and she decides to do this) decided to bring Shakira for free and make a huge debt that the state will have to pay for the next years. 
For what people will want to go one night to see shakira and pay the rest of their working life.
		    this is true. . . . talent is most important.
		 
			
			But I guess,Rihanna is one of most talented female singer. comparing with other new stars       And in the modern era, Arcade Fire       
			
			Better try Janelle Monaé, she is really awesome ( saw 2 concerts ) 
Best female artist i know...
		 
			
			Anyone know Alexander Frei, the Swiss Footballer? He's just an excellent rapper, anyone know when his concert is? I hear you get 3 free sick bags at the entrance       
disgusting...
		 
			
			don´t mess with my Shaki    
VIVA COLOMBIA!, arriba barranquila, THE C.I.A wanna watch?
		 
			
			Since we are now massively off topic anyway...   
Last night I went to see Julieta Venegas as part of the ""Live at Sunset"" at the Dolder Eisbahn. That is Talent, with capital ""T"".   
Despite saying earlier that I thought Shakira was not that bad and I had a good time, Miss Venegas' performance was half the price of Shakira, half the fuss and attitude, and I enjoyed it 10 times more.    
She plays all instruments (keyboard, guitar, accordeon), writes her own songs, the stage was very simple (no ""special effects"") to leave space for her voice and her music. She and her band started at 8:30 on the dot, performed for about 1.5 hours, and at the end gifted the audience with a couple more surprise songs, one of which was a tribute to Los Tigres del Norte, for those among you who know/appreciate the Norteño music.    
Loved it. If you ever have the chance, go see her because she is excellent.
		    RUSH! Yes, you beat me to it, one of my all time favourite bands, I've been listening to Rush ever since someone lent me a copy of ""Moving Pictures"" - when it was a new album, err that was in 1981 - I think that makes me old and a Rush fan for 30 plus years now.
		 
			
			Best thisn is that you couldn't hear her voice, a blessing I would say..
		 
			
			Shakira deserves more . .  ??   
			
			Late to the party dude?   
How was that last Led Zep concert in Nürnberg then....?      4 posts in 5 months, all on the Shakira thread... you   dedicated, my man.       
			
			Since this thread is totally hi-jacked already, I will continue. Canada has a lot of great artists as of late.    
-Arcade Fire (already mentioned) 
-Wintersleep 
-Feist 
-Metric 
-Tegan & Sarah 
-and the list goes on...   
Sadly, Celine tops my least favourite artists list.
		       
It happened exatly the same to me. She came out around 1 hour later or maybe more. The concert it was only too short. She dance, she is pretty and whatever, but her concert is just a piece of rabish. Since i went to her concert in 2008 i never heard again any of his songs..... 
too diva  
too silly
		 
			
			The only woman  with good music and passion is Janelle Monaé , she is awesome. 
Been to 2 concerts of her (Zurich and Amsterdam), she played in small clubs and made really one of the best concerts if have ever seen. 
It is always the same: 
When the star getting bigger , they are loosing the contact to the "" fans"", except a few bands like pearl jam or the foo fighters. 
Nobody wants to pay a fortune to attend a concert, but when you are going to see George Michael /Roger waters / Sting  etc. it will cost a lot of money

			Hey,   
Anybody know if the tickets are transferrable? I am here for studies and was hoping to catch their concert, especially with Sara Bareilles. Now that they postpone it, it is unlikely I can catch it cos I will be returning to my country. Arrrrr..... anyway if it is transferrable I have 3 tickets with me, whoever that is interested I can sell all of them to you at the same price I bought.    
PM me for more details

			Trombone Shorty and Orleans Ave.will be playing at the Hotel Murten on Nov.30 and again in Zurich at the Kaufleuten on Dec.10. He plays a very interesting mix of funk, punk, jazz, and rock that is undeniably all New Orleans. I caught his show at Montreux this year, and believe me you do not want to miss this show. Of every set I attended at the New Orleans Jazz fest last year, his was by far the most attended. He is our pride and we simply adore him in New Orleans. He got his nickname because when he started playing the trombon it was bigger than him. He is an amazing talent backed by an equally talented band.

I write some of my own songs and we also play cover versions of blues, classic rock and funk stuff. Think of it as a very high level bar band that leans more towards the artist direction, we make the covers ' our own' so to speak. Would be great to meet some of you there, just come up an introuduce yourself.

			Anyone up for some good honest sleazy rock n roll in Pratteln on the 7th of December?   
Sister are the exciting newcomers on the Swedish Sleaze and Grunge Metal scene, and they are promised to be supporting German heavy metal legends UDO on their European tour this year in December.    
Sister, who are the prodiges of Martin Sweet of Crashdïet - a Swedish sleaze staple and cult favorite since the early 2000s - combine dirty guitar riffs with gritty vocals and ever so slightly cheesy, anthemic lyrics, and they promise to be a grand old show. My favorite songs from the album are: 
Bullshit & Backstabbing ( ) 
and 
Werewolves on Blackstreet ( )       
As for UDO and Sister Sin - I can't really speak for them much, except that UDO must have been doing something right to last this long.      
I will probably be reviewing this concert anyways, but I always appreciate company at the bar! Anyone up for a grungey night out in Pratteln?

			We just took our two older children (12 and 9) to Cats in Zurich.   
It was awesome.    
Our son was a little embarrassed when the doorman told him he had to check his backpack into the cloakroom - but we followed the instructions and discovered that they issue booster seats to short kids! - 10chf deposit and you get your money back when you return the booster at the end of the show.   
We took back row seats, which meant we could sit up as high as we wanted and wiggle to the music without bothering anyone...   
Oh, and during intermission 'Old Deuteronomy' sat on stage and we were allowed to have our photo taken with him !   
Unfortunately the final show is tomorrow, and it'll sell out - but we are thinking it might be worth saving up for the 'Thriller' show which is scheduled for Basel before Christmas and Zurich just after.   
The venue was Hardturm-Areal, in the big tent. And it was fully heated too!     
Absolutely fantastic !

			hello,   
just thought I would post this here...   
if you fancy listening to some enjoyable choir music, then you might be interested into   concert.   
they  are coming to Switzerland at the end of October and although I am not a  fan of this type of music I think I will go and support them (yes, they  come from my homeland)   and are one of the best choirs in the world. their performance of   has had over 12 million views on youtube.

I've been a huge fan since the early mid 80's, I had no idea she had even been touring because I've just really lost touch since living in Switzerland. I noticed an ad flyer glued to a street corner last week and found that she had already been through Zurich in spring.    
Now, of all places, she just finished touring Southern California where I'm from.     
Much to my surprise, she added fresh shows in Europe in the fall!                  I have my tickets!    
			
			so awesome!! Looking forward to it
		 
			
			This is great do you think she will play her old stuff?
		    No, I'm sure she'll alienate about 95% of the crowd and stick to new material...       
This made me =( I was hoping she would sing by your side, smooth operator, and no ordinary love.
		    Do not worry! If the show is the same as back at 16.05.2011 she will sing all her best songs. I was at the concert in Zurich back in May and it was great. See the link bellow.

			Resurrecting the question....  Bluegrass shows or jam sessions in Switzerland??   
Recently moved to Geneva with my mandolin, and hoping to hook up with a few other BG fans in the area.  Have found a few listings on bluegrass.ch, but all a couple hrs drive from Geneva, mostly in the Zurich area.     
There's bound to be a few players and fans in the Geneva area?  I'm no talent on the mandolin, but really enjoy playing and have done my share of chopping chords.  Just returned from a week at the Winfield festival (in Kansas, of course), and hate to loose the mojo...
		 
			
			I moved here from NC and really miss bluegrass ... 
Festival season is coming to a close but see the following for future reference:      
			
			Thanks Suemck2, at least I can signup for the Euro BG magazine.  Have you ventured out to any of the BG jam sessions in the Zurich area that are listed on bluegrass.ch?  I've been thinking about a weekend in Zurich sometime, and wondering if it's worthwhile to time with one of those sessions.   
Will have to suffice to spend the winter honing my mandolin skills, while waiting for festival season to start back up again!
		 
			
			No I haven't checked out any of the BG jam sessions yet. PM me if you ever want to go though - I'd be into checking them out. There was recently a pretty good BG band from the Netherlands at El Lokal    
			
			Hello all. I am a big bluegrass fan. Before I moved here I lived in NC and could quite easily find live shows to attend.  However, since I moved here my only exposure to it has been internet radio and the cd's I brought with me.  Does anyone know of any venues in Switzerland that book bluegrass acts?  Does bluegrass/country have any kind of following here in Switzerland? I know there is a country festival in Toggenburg - but I don't know anything about the quality of the acts.  Any info would be appreciated.  
Thanks. 
SCM
		 
			
			Sorry, you just missed   yesterday. If you had posted 2 days ago...
		 
			
			That is a shame.  If only I had thought to post something sooner. Thanks for the info though i will keep the link for next year.
		 
			
			Well, I will at least give a partial answer to my question. For those who are interested, here is a website of the Swiss Bluegrass Music Association.       
			
			Oh, I snagged a few of their pens yesterday. Where is Rhinetal? Are you anywhere near Basel? Do you play an instrument yourself?
		 
			
			Thanks for the links! I'm arriving in July with lots and lots of bluegrass music in tow. I don't play at all - utterly without talent - but will go see any local shows. Too bad you missed Uncle Earl. It looks like they have an almost totally new lineup, but they have always been fun to see in the past. I guess they must have skipped Bela Fleck & Abagail Washburn's wedding for that festival...       A very good friend of mine is the lead singer in the group ""Bluebird"".   
You can follow them and check out forthcoming gigs etc. by going to their website  . (Their website is quite new and still ""under construction"". The French section is the most up to date part.)   
HTH

.. 
...
		 
			
			Yes, Uncle Earl played last weekend. They were very convincing with their energy and flexibility. All the members played most of the instruments, switching the instrumentation around every few songs. They were fun to watch.    
The group that really caught me was a Canadian group called RedGrass. They are a young trio that played almost without amplification, very intimate, almost introverted. Really tight arrangements.   
The Katy Kallick Band was also a lot of fun.
		    Rhinetal is in Eastern Switzerland.   I work in Grabs and live in Wildhaus.  At one point I played around a bit with the Mandolin, but haven't touched it in awhile.    
			
			Oh. Too bad. Way too far away. I'm trying to get my mandolin going.

			hello,   
i'm not sure if this is the right place to post but maybe someone who checks this area would find this of interest.  i'm 30 and recently moved to zurich from the US where i was very active in writing, recording, and performing music.   i sing, play guitar, bass, and keyboards.   i'm poking around for a musician to collaborate with.  i'm looking for someone specific..... either...   
1) someone who has a lot of experience making electronic music as well as music production who would be willing to collaborate in writing and recording together.  i have particular strengths in writing melodies, lyrics, and arrangments.  i'm looking for someone who likes to tweak and experiment with sounds who could help to flesh out the sonic environment the songs would inhabit... influences along these lines would be....the faint, new order, the cure (early period), cut copy, passion pit, joy division, depeche mode   
OR   
2) someone who is a multi-instrumentalist, capable of switching from piano to guitar to trumpet to cello etc.  the idea would be to perform songs that i've previously written and/or potentially come up with some new material.    music would be more singer-songwriter in the vein of bright eyes, the good life, elliott smith, etc.   
if you think you might fall into either of these categories or if you may know someone who does, feel free to drop me a line.   
many thanks,

			Anybody going to Grandvaux festival this Friday. If so please support my young friend and student Matthieu Grillet and his band - who will play around 10pm. He is a good rock guitarist and only 15, starting the Lausanne Jazz school next week. Excellent tribute to Lukather and Toto. His dad plays the keyboard, and the base and drums are played by staff from the Boullard's music shop in Morges.
		 
			
			Hi Odele   
Sounds like a cool gig, with Dad on the keys!  TOTO &  Steve Lukather, Pocaro bros., ahh take me back!   
Tiny
		 
			
			Have a look at Matthieu Grillet's website and you will see him playing, aged 12, with Steve. Lukather has taken him under his wing and invites him to play with him whenever he has gigs in Europe- lucky Matthieu. (he is home taught and I teach him English and German). Steve has invited him to LA when he has finished his studies. He's also done master classes with Guthrie Govan.

			thanks for the link, ripz but I think he may put off many people   
what I like about sunn o))) is they're so loud with unbelievably heavy feedback so you hear   feel them. plus they have a wicked sense of humour and each tour is totally different. I like their magpie / working with other artists approach and the fact they dabble with freestyle jazz   
their best tracks in my view are:        uthink? i thought it sounded even more intriguing.      
i'll let you know if i go. i'm not sure it would be a great idea for my tinnitus.

			Anyone attending Marillion/Saga (in Pratteln, Z7 Konzertfabrik) November 26th?   
What about Yes at the Volkhaus in Zürich Nov. 23rd ?   
And what about Arena Nov. 12th in Pratteln ?   
We can coordinate, get together for drinks before the show, go to the show, and stay together for drinks AFTER the show.       Only if someone holds a gun to my head !!   
Marillion were ok as a Genesis tribute band with Fish but now they've turned into the art school boomtown rats    
But if Lynyrd Skynyrd come over , count me in ....
		    Yes to Yes, if Rick Wakemen is performing
		 
			
			I'm afraid it's bound to be Geoff Downes.   He's not too bad.  from the Yes website: ""Geoff went to Leeds School of Music in 1971, graduating in 1975, thus becoming the first member of Yes to graduate with a degree in music."".  He's a pro !        Saw them at the Volkshaus 10 or so years ago.   
Last (and only) time I saw YES was in CT back in '75.   
Saw Rush in Milano in 2004, two two-hour sets with no opening act, great!   
Tom
		 
			
			Count me in for Marilion and Yes. ElggDK will be there for Marillion as well.   
Not sure about Arena, have they got any new material out?
		 
			
			Nothing since 2005/2006 (Pepper's Ghost), their weakest for my taste.  Nothing extraordinary since The Visitor, or Contagion, but they're still pretty good.
		 
			
			Pain of Salvation is at the Komplex in Zürich on Nov. 23. They're more on the metal side of prog, but put on a great show. Saw them at Z7 earlier this year. It was great.
		    Ironic or something to do with destiny, but ""Smoke and Mirrors"" was just playing on my iTunes player as I read your post! Agreed, ""Pepper's Ghost"" wasn't their best, but it had some good tracks, ""Purgatory Road"" is my favorite from that CD. Best CD they've released was ""The Visitor"" back in 1998.
		 
			
			Wow, I've wanted to see them for a long time, never played close enough for me.  I'll have to decide between Yes (whom I've seen a few times already) or Pain of Salvation.  Damn...      They are opening for Opeth on Nov 26, not the 23rd. Already bought the tickets.
		    I just found out this morning that they're opening for Opeth. I think I peed a little when I found out.   
Too bad POS will have a shortened opening set. But on the other hand:  !!!   
P.S. Sorry for the bad date.

			I was in Letzigrund on that day, even though Bon Jovi performed well, I felt that the crowd was not that great! What do you think?
		    Welcome to Swiss crowds. They go to shows to talk loudly to one another, smoke grass and ignore the band on stage. On the other hand, it was Bon Jovi, so maybe it was just you?
		    You have no one to blame but yourself...       Well, I was not exactly standing close to the stage because we got two tickets with seats. I guess the real Swiss Bon Jovi fans were all closer to the band. But then again, we also bought ticket with seats in their concert in Stuttgart in 2008. Even those Germans closer to our seats were all standing up from the beginning till the end to sing along..So that's why I make the comparison...

			Quite a line up for this fest, I would probably check out Macy Gray, Joanna Newsom, Cocorosie, Heather Nova...Sounds like fun.        
			
			Worst festival Name..... Ever!!!!!!!!!
		 
			
			Apart from the name, everything else looks fine    
			
			I thought it was rather cute...considering the chicky muzzak. Teaser.    
But I agree, I would have chosen a different one.
		 
			
			ok for some reason my work filter has blocked that site ( one can only guess )    
but dare I ask...   
where are/is the blue balls held?         Judging by the threads about dating and Swiss women, perhaps it's the best name for a swiss festival in Luzern.
		 
			
			KKL, Pavillion, Schweizerhof, Luzern.    
I think it will be a proper summer lightheaded fun, I would have played there if I could    
			
			haha you thiink it is a translation error. I noticed here (Local)also they were doing some safety on the road action called ""slow up"" (not the big slow down campaign)
		 
			
			one is reminded of a certain AC / DC song.. ( off to find it )         
			
			BTW, apart from the KKL and the Schweirzerhof all night party, Blue Balls is a free festival.  Bands play for free at the Pavilion, oustide the schweizerhof, outside the KKL and I think the bar behind the back of KKL.  There are also the usual festival stalls, with suprisingly good festival food to be had.   
You may be hassled to buy a pin, it's not compuslory, but it will get you into the schweizerhof if you want to party all night, plus you get to support a great festival.  20chf for the pin for the duration of the festival is pretty damn reasonable.   
All beer and drinks purchased at the festival require a deposit, you'll be given a jeton and have to remember to take your glasses back, bit annoying.  I usualy just grab a bunch of beer cans from the bahnhof.
		 
			
			Bump, Starts today!
		 
			
			I saw the name and was expecting to read about a circuit party in Zurich.
		 
			
			Some bands from Friday, Trombone Shorty at the Pavilion, who were excellent.           
And Jordans Drive at the schweizerhof.           
			
			So, after a late cancellation I've got a spare ticket for Joanna Newsom tonight. If anyone wants it for half face-price, gimme a shout!

			The concert was cancelled, and the man on the door just told me about i have to check a website. But in the website does not say anything about the concert. I was wondering if i should go to give the tickets back in the sbb station, but here in switzerland, i dont really think they gonna give me the money back :-(   
What should i do???
		 
			
			Where was the concert supposed to be held? I am thinking likely St. Jakob's Halle but I'm not sure...   
I want to say that it is the responsibility of the concert promoter or the ticket vendor to refund tickets for cancelled shows, not the venue, so check your tickets to see if there is some instructions what to do in the event of cancellation.    
The tickets should have the name of the promoter as well as the ticket vendor, check their websites if there isn't anything specified on the ticket itself.   
If all else fails - and you paid with credit card - you can go through your CC company to get refund based on failure to deliver product / service.     
Meanwhile though, if you ask at the venue during business hours, they can probably help point you in the right direction.
		 
			
			Yes the concert it was to be in ST Jackob's halle. In the ticket say i have to check in the website goodnews.ch but i did many times and no new of what happen with this concert.  
I bought the ticket in sbb station, and i paid cash, so i will go tomorrow to ask was is going on, cuz i think the concert was not cancelled, was just procastined.    
Thanks for your reply!!!

			This year's Parade is tomorrow, Saturday the 23rd       
We'll be away so will miss it  .  We did get to see the tattoo which was fantastic but one thing was missing - Basel's own - The Amazing Top Secret Drummers.  So I was gutted to find out that although they are not in the Tattoo they are in the Parade!!!
		 
			
			For those unable to get tickets to the Basel Tattoo 2010, there's an official parade through town on the afternoon of 24 July.           
Datum: Samstag, 24.07.2010 
Beginn: 14.00 Uhr 
Route: Freie Strasse - Marktplatz - Mittlere Brücke - Clarastrasse - Claramatte. 
Eintritt frei.   
Good entertainment for the kids, enjoy!
		 
			
			I went to the Tattoo on Thursday night.  It was fantastic!  Can't believe how lucky we were with the weather - rain all afternoon and apparently also for the early performance but we were there at 10.00pm and after a few spots of rain it cleared up and we had a wonderfully dry evening!  I'm a sucker for military and pipeband music (I'm Scottish!) so lapped up every minute.  I love how they dish out those trendy little plastic macs, a great idea.   
And yes, went to the parade yesterday too, and again was impressed that the weather-god got it right!  Great crowds so lovely to see everyone in the swing of it.   
Saw Bob from Boston pass by where I was standing on the bridge but too late for me to call out hi.    
			
			We looked in the Basler Zeitung and only found a tiny corner notice about the street parade. Too late to go and see. Pity, I have family over from overseas. Would have been nice for them.   
Dunno how people find out about these things. Where do they advertise them? (not the Tatoo itself of course; just the ""Street Parade"")
		    not sure if the parade was in, but for ""culture"" in general I can recommend Thursday's Basler Zeitung covering all sorts of events, exhibitions, music etc up to wed the week after.
		 
			
			Adverts on trams (the A4 cards above the seats) are a good source of info in my case.   
There's also the city's website:   "	5	6	 Dec 2009	['9', '680', '4', '072']	"Basel Tattoo ""Street"" Parade 2010 [Added: Saturday, July 23rd 2011]"	Carlos R	7095	2904	Concerts

			Quick question....have concerts ever been cancelled at Moon and Stars due to bad weather?   
I'm in Ascona and it's been raining since last night.....and I mean really chucking it down with lightening forecast for tonight as well.   
In fact mete had a dangerous weather warning because of the rain...do just wondering if the organisers had called off gigs in the past and any idea on how I would find out before I get there by bus???   
Thanks
		 
			
			I don't recall if they've canceled in the past, I've certainly been there in the pouring rain!   
They are giving some warnings about the weather on Rete3, especially for Sopra Ceneri (which means Locarno), and mentioned something about a landslide in or near Ascona (yesterday, I think).   
Peak bad weather should be starting now, they said.  Heavy rain and intense thunderstorms.   
Can't find any info on their site.   
Tom
		     
Thanks Tom   
I can definitely verify that the bad weather has really come in - thunder and lightening just started 30 secs ago, and cannot see anything beyond the flat we are in which, yesterday, had great views of the lake, the valley and the suburbs of Locarno.   
Don't mind outing rain but it's really bouncing down!   
Will keep an eye on the website before we head off...91 chfs is too much to dip out of the concert.   
Valerie
		 
			
			Well decided to go and though it was chucking it down while the Wailers were on, it dried up for most of Jack Johnson's set which was superb but there I was with my clear waterproof poncho.   
Crowd looked like a ghosts convention all swaying to the music with clear waterproofs on...very spooky   
Highlight was two male streakers walking nonchalantly through the crowd having a general chat until security caught up with them.   
Can you guess what was the only thing Security had to dress them in when caught????   Yes a clear waterproof each..sort of defeated the object of covering them up!

			I have 4 tickets for the Basle tattoo Friday 22nd July 5pm show.  
Due to a conflict of events we would like to find someone who has tickets for a show earlier in that week that we could possibly swop with.
		 
			
			Did you try taking them to the Ticket office to swap?  We did that with an indoor show in January.  I went to the Basel tatto office with no expectation that they would change tickets for us but they did!!  And the new tickets were in cheaper seats and they refunded the tickets.  Worth a try.  The office is now in front of the Kaserne.

			Hello!   
We are thinking of taking our 4 year old along to one of the free 'Music in the Park' events in the afternoon this coming weekend. 
However, looking at the website,     
it states children under the age of 6 are not admitted.   
I can understand this for the   concert venues (volume reasons, I guess), but does anyone know how strongly this is reinforced at the park?   
Have you ever seen small children at the free afternoon music in the park?? Or did you go along to the park this weekend with your under 6 year old and get turned away??   
The website states there is childcare available (a great idea). 
But we actually   to take the kid along with us to the park in the afternoon!   
Thanks for any tips    
			
			I was wandering around Montreux on sat and there were young children everywhere. Can't imagine how they would police that no children could stop at an open park area when such a high proportion of general foot traffic walking past are underage (but maybe I missed something).
		 
			
			Probably best to leave at home. It can be heaving. The loud music can't be good for young ears, nor can being crushed/trampled by the crowds.
		 
			
			I go down to the free concerts every year. I doubt that you would have any problems with this.
		    Eeekkk!!!! Crushed and trampled  
Sounds like the kind of gigs I used to go to in my student years   
Surely this is not 1pm in the park on a sunny Saturday??!
		 
			
			IMHO the english speaking version of the website is a bit misleading.   
The French version which uses the term ""salles de concert"" and the German version which uses ""Konzerthalle"" (both of them translating to ""concert hall"") seem to indicate that children are only banned from entering the (paying) indoor concerts and not the open-air (free) concerts in the park.
		 
			
			you should leave kids at home in my opinion. specially if in a stroller. everyone runs into you, you run into everyone and hold everyone back as noone makes space for the strollers. It is loud, hot, lots of smoke from the food, and really all it is (besides the actual concerts) is a bunch of homemade crafts, the guy that moves when you give him money........     
Christmas market is MUCH better
		 
			
			Hi, coincidentally I am thinking about the same for this weekend, going to Montreux with my 3.5y boy. A friend was there at the brazilian night (last Saturday) and said she saw children about that age inside the concert venue. I am not sure how they got in and would not count on it.  
However, there´s no restriction on the public areas such as a the park.  
As a parent you probably exprienced already that everything is about aligning the expectations. You won´t expect to be in the first row close to the stage or doing a stage dive when you are with kids. But if you make your mind to be back there just enjoying the atmosphere, there should be no prob.    
Your OP is from July 4th, if you have gone already let me know how was it.    
Thanks
		 
			
			Hi Edu,  
We didn't go last weekend in the end cos the kid had a party to go to. BUT we are definitely going this Sat (last day!) to check out the free 'Music in the Park'. Had a look on-line and listened to the clips, and the band playing in the park at 1515 on Saturday sounds like it could be fun!

			I'm super keen on going to Gurtenfestival this Saturday, but tickets are sold out, and looking on Marketplace, I've got some competition from others looking to snatch up unwanted tickets.   
So I'm wondering what are my chances of rocking up in Bern on Saturday and finding a couple of tickets? Okay, not *finding* exactly, but coming across someone who can't go at the last minute? Want to avoid the scalpers obviously, but does anyone have any experience of whether you can find tickets outside an event the same day?
		 
			
			Most similar places I've been to have plenty of people selling tickets on the day outside the venue.  Be prepared for a bit of a mark-up on the price, though    
			
			Try at ricardo.ch or if you don't care: alltickets.ch

			So, who is going to venture out this year?   
I just went and booked for the 11-14 July. Just the hotel, nothing else.   
The only thing advertised so far is Sting and thats long since sold out. He is also playing at the Locarno Moon and Stars concert.   
I'm not really fussed if it's a weak lineup as last year I had a great time without seeing any listed bands.   
The complete program of the 45th Montreux Jazz Festival will be released on April 14, 2011, at 10am.    
Maybe I can meet some more EF'ers....
		 
			
			Already looking forward to it!  Hopefully I'll still be in the country by that time!  I've been looking forward to it for a long time now.  How is it set up? is there more than one outdoor venue?  If I just go to Montreux, will I be able to hear the musicians without buying a ticket (for the ones that require a ticket)? 
Can't wait!
		    You will be out of luck hearing the major acts for free.  They are all indoors but there are some outdoor events.  See the main site:    
			
			most of the main acts these days at montreux aren't really worth seeing as they're just in it to fill their boots with CHF.    
what's really fun imho is walking around montreux during the festival seeing the smaller acts doing it for the fun of it.   
			
			Last year, some surprisingly decent up and coming acts played for free (Fanfarlo and Drums, to name a couple), so it's definitely worth going, even if you're not going to any of the paying gigs.
		 
			
			We saw quite a few gigs last year and had a ball! It was fantastic watching Julian Casablancas attempting to get the Swiss to mosh (it didn't happen  )and Ben Harper playing until they kicked him off stage as he loved the acoustics in the room. We're willing to pay the extra purely because love seeing bands in more intimate settings than we'd ever be able to see in Australia. We're waiting until the full program comes out but we'll probably be around    
			
			I usually head to the Jazz Cafe and watch the free live bands. great atmosphere there.
		 
			
			love the jazz cafe and the free acts are the best ones. last year we saw a couple of really young bands that were pretty good. as for sting- you'd have to pay me to see him, he bothers me a good bit but i'm hopîng the lineup this year isnt the year 1998 revisited like it was last year. its great to have a bit of nostalgia but enough is enough. still a fun place to go, though.
		 
			
			We will more than likely heading down there at some point as we had a great time last year. Would highly recommend buying ice cream or a cocktail served in a coconut and having a wander along the lake front and enjoying all the free performances.
		 
			
			I have no idea how much truth there is to the following but the rumours I've heard include the following main acts in addition to the already confirmed Sting: 
Deep Purple 
Arcade Fire 
BB King 
The Vaccines 
Ziggy Marley 
Robert Randolph and the Family Band 
Paul Simon 
Jimmy Cliff 
Carlos Santana & John McLaughlin   
We'll know for sure in another 3 days when more details are announced by the organisers.
		    Sting is sold out.      are 'apparently confirmed' for 16th July.    They are becoming an almost permanent fixture now.
		     
Already attended at the BB King concert in Perugia...   
I was thinking to go for Santa&McLaughlin    
			
			arcade fire is officially confirmed for 10 july.
		 
			
			Just seeing Deep Purple and Carlos Santana & John McLaughlin would be worth the tickets. Shame Gary Moore (R.I.P.) won't be there this year, to see him, Steve Morse and John McLaughlin would be close to seeing my top three guitarists of all time in the space of a week. Maybe Gurthrie Govan will show up instead...      Deep Purple have announced the rest of their tour today. Some dates are supported by Iggy & The Stooges. Most dates are with a full orchestra.    
Should be confirmed in a couple of days.
		    They obviously didn't get my email asking them to change to a Friday or Saturday night    I bet they'll be fantastic...sigh
		 
			
			Tickets are on sale now..   
I just got my tickets.   
			
			I'm definitely keen for Arcade Fire. The rest looks fairly lame   
The tickets are usually outrageously expensive yes?   
Edit: Shiez I didnt see Prince Paul and Afrika Bambada. That would be ace
		    There are still 19 tickets left for Arcade Fire (who also have James Vincent McMorrow on the same bill) a snip at CHF 240 each! Standing tickets are a more affordable CHF 95.
		 
			
			I wouldnt feel right sitting down watching Arcade fire to be honest. Unless im watching jazz or classical or sting :P there would be no way im sitting
		 
			
			Here is the official programme:     
It seems that the rumours were all true.  There are still a few acts to be announced, generally support acts.
		 
			
			The Vaccines are due to play the Jazz Café on July 5th.   
I went to see them at the Electric Ballroom in Camden last Friday, they were magnificent.
		 
			
			Got my tickets for Arcade Fire & History of Hip Hop, neither of which lend well to seating imo    
			
			Based on my experience last year, I'd advise anyone with a standing tickets that it really pays to get into the Stravinski Auditorium early to grab a spot at the front of the standing section. Those under 6ft may struggle to see the stage and performers as it is not raised that much higher.    
			
			Deep Purple tix booked    
			
			95CHF or 240CHF to go see Arcade fire, WTF?
		 
			
			prices are absurd but that didn't stop me from pulling the trigger for:   
Carlos Sanata + John McLaughlin (i'd pay more to see just McLaughlin) 
Santana (needed something more mainstream to take my wife to) 
Return to Forever IV (they were amazing last time with Al, looking forward to the new incarnation)     
now who's bringing the shrooms?      (for the pizza of course)   
			
			Any idea how much the tickets cost?
		    Id rather see them for 95 than everyone else playing.
		    Yeah, me too, I bought the tickets.
		 
			
			i have an extra ticket for Carlos Sanata + John McLaughlin on July 1. PM me if interested.
		 
			
			I ended up un-intentionally scoring tickets to both BB King shows and now can't decide whether to go back to back or offload one concert.  Each show will just have its own style, I'm torn!
		 
			
			I got tiks for a show with George Benson, Diana Krall, Randi Crawford and Dr. John.       
then Diana Krall cancelled       
			
			anna calvi is playing for free at the jazz cafe on monday 4th july - well worth seeing.
		 
			
			Hello, 
I've got a ticket for the 2nd of July for B.B.King.   
Since I will not make it, is anyone interested on going there? 
The price of the ticket is 85 CHF!
		 
			
			I am there from the 13th until th 16th.   
Anyone want to meet for drinks on the Wednesday night at the Jazz Cafe?   
Get an EF thing going.       
			
			I am heading off to see DEEP PURPLE on the 16th of July.     
Got 2 spare tickets - Unfortunately I have bought some more for friends who cannot join - PM me if interested.         
			
			Also, does anyone of you have the pleasure to see Sting at this years festival? They run out of tickets so quickly I couldn't get any (presale in March I believe)  (
		    I got two for Locarno so didn't bother with the Montreux one
		    well.... I just got an interesting update from MontreuxJazz... it seems Diana found out I was upset over her cancelling so she has rebooked.   
along with new additions to the show  David Sanborn and Joe Sample                     that can be also nice, it is takin place as an oper air event right? 
need to check if they have got any spare tickets ...
		 
			
			I went to 4 shows last year...  
This year I'm not even sure if I'll come for the free shows despite the fact that I live nearby... 
Overall - disappointment (chinese noodles included), unless your favourite artist performs there.
		     
But you'd already sold the tickets on ebay and had to buy them back at double the price, right?      
But yes, Diana Krall would be the highlight of that particular set for me, although George Benson has some nostalgic attraction for me, my mum had a few of his records and I remember attempting to wear out a couple of the tracks - Take Five, Breezin, White Rabbit and of course On Broadway
		    when Diana canceled I talked to mrs. G about canceling but we decided to tough it out and settle for Geo Benson , Randi Crawford and Dr. John as the bill was then.  Now of course mrs.costello is back on along with some very nice additions.    
( p.s.. 6 or 7 years ago we saw Diana and George also at Montreux.. they were performing separately on the same bill, but did a few numbers together.. very nice
		 
			
			Well BB '85 years old' King was not at his best (nor I supsect anywhere near it for the last 10 years at least), but support act Charles Bradley kicked arse, but the Sunday night show with Santana et al. was a lot of fun.  All in all a very expensive and tiring weekend, which was good fun but perhaps not entirely a value for money investment.   
I know why those trains stop all stations on the way back to Geneva, but mon dieu it can be a PITA.  Concert finished at 11:50pm but there were no trains until the 1:08am, which got into Geneva at around 2:30am. Of course everyone ran for the taxi rank and we chose to leg it rather than queue and wait for reinforcements, finally getting in the door at 3am - 3 hours after the concert finished!!
		    I was tempted to splash out myself as I'm a big jazz fanatic having been at least once to most of the US and EU jazz festivals over the years though curiously haven't ever made it to Montreux and, well, I've seen him play in the early 80s in a small venue in St. Louis (along with Chuck Berry) so was hesitant to find myself 25+ years on and disappointed. It's always something to experience the music live and in an intimate setting so it's not all bad.    
As long as you saw something you liked, it's a win. Still, at those eye popping prices, you could catch a flight to the Newport Jazz and see everything...with an occasionally better lineup.
		       
mawler,  mrs. and I did the same thing the night before last... Geo.Benson and company concert ended about 12:30 but by the time we made it out of the concert hall we just barely made the 11:08 train.. and had to join the queue at Cornavin... luckily every cabbie in Geneva must have been told there was a crowd waiting so we didn't have to wait too long and also made it home just before 3.am

			That sounds like something i would go to.
		 
			
			I'm dying to see Beirut again but 88 fr. is a bit steep (I also love The National but I've seen them a billion times) plus festival shows are never as good.
		 
			
			Same here with The National, but it'll be one of my first Swiss gigs so want to start on a high! I think the combination of them and Beirut will make it just about worth the 88 francs. Have either played in Zurich before, do you know?
		    They both played Mascotte in November 2007 but I don't think either have been back since (apart from for Festivals).   
A lot of bands seem to avoid Switzerland on European tours, I guess due to bookers in Switzerland not being quite on the ball.
		 
			
			I'll be there. such a great line-up. i saw beirut at mascotte ages ago, and they were absolutely amazing. likewise, the national - saw them twice last year and they were brilliant.
		 
			
			I am going to, looking forward to seeing Warpaint !
		 
			
			If you like the national and beirut, you might also like....

He always puts on a great show -- check out anything off of ""Letter to Laredo"" an album with many great songs and an excellent Bruce Springsteen cameo.       
I'm planning on going, although I know nothing about the venue or city (looks to be on the outskirts/in the suburbs of Basel).

			Good Texas singer-songwriter -- he wrote the song ""The Weary Kind"" from the movie Crazy Heart.

			Already got my tickets...bizzare venue choice mind    Still, there will be cheese and beer!
		    The venue isn't the Viadukt Markthalle restaurant, but the Viadukt restaurant in one of the arches. It is a tad confusing.
		    Yeah, it got me the first time too.  It's actually a nice venue for a smaller show.  I saw Scott Biram there a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it.
		    Balls.  I was hoping for a nice reserved seat at the bar with the beer top-ups on demand    
			
			Thanks for the post! Would have never known.  
Sounds great, am probably going. 
Have a nice weekend!   
Cheers, 
Rosanne
		 
			
			Btw - there's a jeff bridges special this month at Xenix, i believe they're screening Crazy Heart sometime next week; should you want to stay in the same mood.
		 
			
			OH NO!  
Concert is sold out... Well, i guess it'll be just the movie then..  
Or let me know if you have an extra ticket to sell!   
Cheers, 
Rosanne
		 
			
			Hi!   
Looking for 2 tickets for this sold-out show tonight... please contact me if you know of any extras, thanks!!!!
		 
			
			I managed to get in by virtue of the fact that the sound guy is a fellow Houston Astros fan -- he's actually from a town near where I grew up too -- but I was fortunate for the hook-up.  It was a really good show and quite crowded by the standards of the shows I've seen here.  Not only that, but the crowd was very engaged, which always improves the experience.   
Whoever is booking the Viadukt is doing nice job of getting solid Americana acts.

			Hi!  Anyone going?  I'll be there.     
Türöffnung: 13h30  
14h30 - 15h30 Night Ranger  
16h00 - 17h00 Saga  
17h30 - 18h30 Kansas

			I hope that Foreigner are better than this        
			
			Gawd .... are they still going?   
Or maybe it's because they're known as Reisen and Ausländer, here?
		 
			
			How many of the originals are in those bands  ...? 
Steve Perry gave up years ago  
Lou Gramm looked like he had a few issues there !   
Since read that Lou has had brain cancer - so I'll take my last comment back!
		 
			
			So, nobody going?  What's wrong with you old EFers?  Forgotten how wonderful the 80's were?  Have you stopped believin?  No longer waiting for a girl like you?  No jukebox heros anymore?     
Well then, I'll just have to take up this golden oldies opportunity by myself. With anti-aging cream in one hand and a blanket for a nap in the other, I'm hyping myself up for this pre-retirement adventure.  I'll give a full report tomorrow.
		    ...... or just think that 80's American glam rock has it's time and place, and should be left to rest in peace - along with big hair, shoulder pads and tight trousers.      There are notable exception to the rule including the Rolling Stones.  They still give a brilliant concert.
		    The Stones aren't 80's American glam rock, though.   
... and I agree, there are notable music exceptions from the 80's that have time travelled  artists and songs - but in general terms glam rock seemed to echo the lifestyle and fashions of the 80's - that as a decade was always struggling for a unique identity, after the exuberance and excesses of of the 60's and 70's (the latter, we only realised after the 80's had begun).   
For me, when I hear old music, it always takes me back to the time and place where I was, when it was first released. Perhaps the 80's is not always to where I want to be returned regularly.   
I prefer to get my flares and platforms out and have some Slade, Mud, Sweet, Bowie, EJ,   (oops), et al.
		 
			
			Quick Review:   
Night Ranger:  We got there too late so I can't say 
Saga:  OK  
Kansas:  Fantastic 
Foreigner:  The best.  Knocked our socks off 
Journey:  A disappointment.  They played more stuff off their new album than their old hits.  No Sherrie or Open Arms.    
The audience was 40ish to 60ish.  The Eishalle was a nice place for this venue.  All the bands played live and were top knotch performers.  I'd definitely go to another similar venue again.     
Grade:  A-
		    Hi Olygirl we also enjoyed it a lot!   
Here is my rating (and sorry I didn't reply earlier in the week, didn't see the post): 
-Night Ranger was ok, at least they had a bit of connection with the audience 
-Saga: disappointed. I felt them distant. No   (difficult to play, maybe that's why),   or  , my three favorites! 
-Kansas: Fantastic 
-Foreigner: superb! I was hungry for more. Loved  ! 
-Journey: worthy our three-hours trip to the concert! I am not too much into  , so not a miss for me. Don't stop believin' was just too good! and the finishing with   was perfect (btw   is with Steve Perry as solo singer, not part of the Journey repertoire, so I am afraid it will be a bit difficult to have that one  ). Arnel Pineda simply revived the band. Agree too many new songs (three too many!  ), but I guess, that is a good thing (although am with you, not the best!)     
Grade: A++ for less than a 100CHF it was a real bang for our buck!

			This should be a very good concert. Lots of good musicians playing. All you EFers should go. This will be a good one.    
The church is at Wettsteinplatz and is the perfect venue for this type of music.

			Have 2 tickets for 3rd July (Cold play, Portishead, Underworld, Bruno Mas) that won't be needing them, I bought them for 69 EUR each you can have them for 50 EUR delivered in France or Switzerland by post   
Anybody interested?          Friday already sold out.   But I have already a ticket for Saturday!  Hello Pearl Jam!!!       ----        Avec le 2 Juillet :  
THE BLACK EYED PEAS / DAVID GUETTA / VITALIC / LA ROUX / JAMIROQUAI / BLOODY BEETROOTS DEATH CREW 77 / PONY PONY RUN RUN AND MORE ! 
le 3 juillet :  
PEARL JAM / BEN HARPER AND RELENTLESS7 / -M- / PHOENIX / COHEED &amp; CAMBRIA / WOLFMOTHER &amp; MORE ! 
le 4 juillet : 
RAMMSTEIN / PINK / GOSSIP / STEREOPHONICS / FLORENCE &amp; THE MACHINE &amp; THE MACHINE &amp; MORE !         
			
			Damn you!  I'd strongly recommend Wolfmother, Coheed & Cambria and Ben Harper (although I preferred his stuff with The Innocent Criminals compared to The Relentless 7).   
But yeah Pearl Jam headlining will be a bit special.   
The other two days lineups look really weak compared to the Saturday, think you've definitely got the best ticket there    
I'm away that weekend    
			
			I saw Wolfmother in Reykjavik few years ago. Happy to be able to see them again, but this is a first time for Pearl Jam and look very much forward to it!

Anyone been in the past or planning to go? It's going to be June 24, 2011 in Basel.    
Bands include: Iron Maiden, Slipknot, Alice Cooper, Bring Me the Horizon, In Flames, Architects, Skindred, and Hatebreed.   
I mostly want to go to see Iron Maiden, but wouldn't mind seeing some of the others. Of course it will depend on how beastly the ticket price is!
		 
			
			Several members went last year     
			
			i was on concerts like deep purple, metallica, bon jovi, iron maiden and some other which im proud of i think ill be going to this concert here just for iron maiden because i know that they will ROCK the stage   
			
			I will visit the greenfield open air (there are : Foo Fighters , System of a Down 
and many more)
		 
			
			I'm glad to see others will be there!!! Greenfield Open Air looks pretty good too, I may have to try out that one    
			
			I'm in! Especially for Slipknot.   
			
			Still not sure if I should go to the UK Sonisphere to see the big 4 again, it was great last year (apart from all the mud, obviously). 
Deffo going to Greenfield, Foo Fighters, Volbeat and Flogging Molly - get in!    
			
			I went to last year's Sonishere In Jonschwil and almost drowned in mud   but I finally got to see all 4 founding fathers of Thrash metal!   
This year looks good too, especially cos of Maiden - I've not seen them live yet.    
I'm definitely going.   
Tickets pre-sale starts Jan 26th on  .       
			
			I may be up for the sonisphere when the tickets go on sale 
Would love to see the Foo Fighters as well
		 
			
			dumb question from someone new to Zurich  - is there a site where I can find out about upcoming festivals in the area? 
Thanks 
Sue
		 
			
			There is a forum for the metal/rock venue near Basel called Z-7 at    
They discuss most intensively gigs at Z-7, but also tend to mention festivals, concerts etc. around Switzerland, particularly related to all forms of the world's most goodest musical style... metal.   
If you can read German, you can follow the discussions. If you can't look for the forum section ""Konzerte anderswo"" -   - and you can see the band names and locations there.   
There might be a better site for Zurich locals, but not being one myself, I don't know.   
On another note, if you're into less commercial stuff than Sonisphere, Basel will host a 4-day festival at the end of May at Z-7. I went in 2009 and it was good. 2011 lineup looks decent to date and I'll be there with a couple of beer-bingeing Aussies.              
There is the Moon and Stars concert in Locarno or head to Montreux..
		      is great, only in German though.
		 
			
			or you can check ticketcorner.ch, then go on to festivals/openairs or citys and then go to music sytle(alternative for example). 
Another open air festival is near belfort/france(around 1,5 hours by train from basel ), there is a 3 day festival from the 1st to the 3rd of july 2011(last year    
line up and a few more like Janelle Monae) 
This festival is at a lake near belfort(train service between belfort and the festival during the whole day for free when you got a ticket for it )
		 
			
			first acts are published for 2011 at eurocknees belfort:   
Arcade Fire 
Arctic Monkeys 
Motörhead 
Tiken Jah Fakoly 
House of Pain 
Boys Noize 
tickets for 3 days (incl.camping ) are 95 euros, day tickets will be around 42 euros, weekend ticket is 74 euros
		 
			
			News for the Greenfield Open Air: 
New Confirmed Acts from Jan 26 2011: 
Disturbed, Bullet for my Valentine, The Gaslight Anthem, Social Distortion ,Apocaliptica, Framing Hanley, Suicide Silence, Converge, Alesana
		 
			
			I'd like to be in attendance. I'm hoping to have fun...
		 
			
			Gah all these sound great...I'm really leaning towards going to Greenfield but IRON MAIDEN is making this a very tough decision. If anyone's looking for anyone to go, I'm pretty new to Zurich and want to buy a ticket but really don't want to go alone!
		 
			
			The line up for this years   has just been announced:   
The highlights are:   
Eric Burdon and The Animals 
Roger Hodgson & Band (Supertramp) 
Manfred Manns Earthband 
Texas 
Jimmy Cliff       
Nothing outstanding but it could be worth a visit if you are in the area.  I had a great time there last year, despite the wet weather.  The great time was due to the company, and the alcohol.       Understatement of the year !!
		 
			
			I just bought my ticket for the Friday of the Sonisphere Festival leg in Basel (24 June).  
I am wondering if there are any other people on here that are going and maybe would like to meet up in the arena for a beer and get-to-know you while watching some seriously cool bands.
		    I'm planning to go to this one.  I will be away for Greenfield but was thinking of going to southside festival in Germany, its mostly the same lineup.
		 
			
			I'll be going to this festival on Friday, pretty excited about it.  Scored free tickets to it, it pays to know people    
Couple questions: typically there's a ""will-call"" window at venues in the US, and I have to find the equivalent at St. Jakobshalle.  Anybody know 1) what it's called in German and 2) where it is at this venue?  I suppose I could just wander around til I find it, but just in case someone knew, I wanted to ask.
		 
			
			the "" will Call "" window is a counter wich is specially marked , many times  
at the same location (Entrance to the venue)where the ticktes can be bought, if they are still available.

			Hi, What does Abendkasse mean in Switzerland? Would the theatre sell available tickets at regular price 1 hour before the show begins? Or are the tickets sold at a discount?   
Also, does anyone have any experience with using the Abendkasse versus purchasing the tickets in advance? Are there usually good tix available at the Abendkasse? (I'm in Zurich)   
Thank you!
		    Abendkasse basically is the set number of tickets they hold back to sell at the venue locally on the night of the show, for people that can't or do not want to reserve.   
This does not necessarily indicate any kind of discount though. An obvious advanta is that you do not have to cue or be dissappointed, when there are no more tickets available, obviously. Not sure about ""good tickets"" - I assume they do let people reserve the best seats available and then only sell the remainders on the night..

Got tickets today to see Vieux Farka Touré and Hossam Ramzy at the Afro-Pfingsten Festival on 12th June - V excited!   
Anyone else going?          Depends on the weather, the prices and the programs. I in n recent years often visited the Afro-Pfingsten

Here's a link to the line-up:    
So it's outside is it?
		 
			
			Will be there on Friday and Saturday. Concerts are Inside.   
All other activities such as workshops are outside in the towncenter.
		 
			
			cool thanks, I'll miss you by a day then Prof. taratonga!
		 
			
			Was there yesterday for a while.     
We wandered round, soaked up the atmosphere, listened to music at various spots, ate some delish African food, had some drinks and just generally had a good time.     
The main highlight for me was seeing a little girl (around 9 months to a year) clapping her tiny hands perfectly in time to the music at one place we stopped at and really enjoying the rhythms.  It was a sheer delight watching her.       That is quite normal in Africa and Southamerica...   
the Swiss girls don't manage to do it even when well on their 30s ( or in some cases never   )

This award winning story is about a young prince sent out into the world by his father the king to find the strongest force possible.  Linard Bardill tells the story of a thrilling emotional encounter with the four elements of fire, water, air and earth.  The Rose of Jericho is definitely a welcome opportunity to bring children closer to musical instruments as well as allowing them to feel the power of music   
This will be at the TONHALLE, KLEINER SAAL, ZURICH on SUNDAY 19 JUNE at 11:15am and one of the highlights of the Zurich Festival 2011.  This will be a unique experience to meet Linard Bardill and listen to his enchanting story telling accompanied by five musicians from the Tonhalle Orchestra Zurich.  Tickets are CHF 15 for kids (under 13 years) and CHF30 for adults.   
Linard will be available after the concert to meet, ask questions, sign books and CD`s. Tickets in advance here:     [eventUid]=677&cHash=6a7ee2843bc83b5123ca10fb8fa154e4

			hey, i've got some meet & greet + show tix to give away for the DJ Shadow gig at Komplex, ZH this Saturday - does anyone want one? it's meant to be a great show, and Josh Davis is a bit of a legend.

			Not sure of the times but there were 3 guys playing them beautifully this morning and they look to be set up for the day. Looks like the ""concert"" is organised by one of the Zurich Churches, probably warming up for Ascension day tomorrow.   
If you haven't heard these being played at close quarters, you're in for a treat!
		 
			
			Will you still be saying it's a treat after you have heard them 15 times over today?       I'm not working there today, but I doubt it'd be a problem, they were playing very gently and the horns were pointing in the direction of the tracks, away from the market. I'll be there from 5 though and will report back if they become a pain!

			Wow, 
I have just relocated to Lausanne from Melbourne and I love these guys. 
Anyone care to advise what the D ckub is like? 
Kid friendly??
		    It's a nightclub. 
Not really kid friendly.
		 
			
			I would love to go to he gig in bern but it's sold out. Do you think you can buy tickets at the gig?
		 
			
			Lausanne sold out also    
How come these guys are so popular in Switzerland???
		    Cause angus goes out with a famous model    
Or actress, I couldn't tell
		 
			
			It's such a shame the Lausanne show sold out. It would have been nice to catch up with some fellow Aussies; or indeed fellow Melbourners!
		      Try Nyon on JUly 20 - that is not sold out (yet.)
		    Hi Renji. 
I moved to Lausanne from Melbourne in April. How good's the weather!! 
Yes I am really annoyed wih myself, for being too laid back, thinking that they would not sell out (I am fast shaking out my Aussie attitude over here). I would have loved to bump into an aussie or 2.   
Have fun if you get along, is sure to be good.
		    Also appears to be sold out    
			
			Any reports?

			Anyone perhaps have tickets for sale or know where to get them? It's at Komplex 457...do these kinds of venues ever let more people in if you wait outside? I found out about the concert 2 days after the tickets went on sale and of course it was sold out   This is probably a fruitless attempt but figured I'd try!
		 
			
			here are 2 links for tickets:       
the first offer is not too bad(99 chf),  i think....
		 
			
			Wow, is that kind of stuff legal? Looks like these sites bought tickets to sell them for more. Oh well haha. I may have found a solution for the problem. Queens is going to be at a festival in St. Gallen in July, and I can see them and other bands as well for 88 CHF I think. So unless I find some cheaper tickets (would honestly still prefer to see them in Zurich, especially since I have to leave the morning after the festival for Italy) I guess I will take that option. I'll bookmark these for future reference though, so thanks

			Scott H. Biram a one-man country/punk/blues machine from Austin, Texas plays the Viadukt the evening of 21 April.  He always puts on a great show and is worth checking out.
		 
			
			Whereabouts in the Viadukt will this be... and do you have a link?
		 
			
			er, time? What venue in the Viadukt? Link?
		     
Sorry, I'm new here and don't know the protocol.  It only says Viadukt 8-9.  No idea what that means, but I live next door and figure I can find it.  Supposed to start at 8 PM.  I just saw the sign on a pole and checked out Biram's website.
		     
Here's from the MySpace page.  It looks like it's maybe where the restaurant is?
		 
			
			it's nice of you to post it with the recommendation, even if it was a cryptic posting, because there's lots of people here (including me) who are interested in cool gigs. Perhaps you have seen the  ? Maybe this thread could be added to that one.   
Viadukt's   says it starts at 9, entry is 20 Sfr./15 for students.         
			
			Yeah, it's tough to track things on that string.  Also, this is more show than concert, at least in my provincial usage.  I've found it a bit tough (only having been here for 5 weeks) to find out about small shows and was pleased to see that this one was right next to my flat.  I used to see Biram regularly in Austin, for about 1/5 the price.  My wife and I will be there for sure.

			hi, 
i was too late to be informed of the Nas/Damian concert next friday, cuz the tickets are sold out. Any tips if there are some miraculous means of getting one? I really can't miss it    
			
			Scalpers? 
I'd say craigslist in the US but that doesn't seem too active here.
		 
			
			There's at least one auction on Ricardo:       
			
			it depends if you live near the venue. To tell you the truth I have never seen a concert where they were not selling tickets in front of the venue shortly before the concert. When I was young and did not want to pay the full price I always waited outside the venue until the prices dropped. You just have to be patient. Wait as long as you can, the prices are usually the lowest once the support act has already started with the show. People you bought a ticket but don't want to go just want to get rid of them. This has always worked for me so far      
Good luck!   
there also seem to sell tickets here   (note: I just googled NAS Konzert Schweiz and that was the first link provided. I have never used that service before but maybe it's worth a try as well).
		 
			
			Thanks a lot folks! I'll try my luck    
			
			Ticketcorner.ch are not saying they're sold out - just that they are 'no longer deliverable' - i.e. too near to the date for them to post them. You may still be able to get them from a Post Office or train station with a Ticketcorner terminal behind the counter but I'm not sure.   
Viagogo.ch are usually good for sold-out events or where you are looking for a particular seating area that has gone - but they don't have any tickets listed for this event. They offer a guarantee that the tickets sold are as promised.   
Finally there is ricardo.ch - the online auction site - they have 2 auctions on at the moment for Nas/Damian Marley in Zurich, but they don't conclude until the 6th. You don't get a guarantee with these - you just have to rely on the feedback on the seller as with ebay.

			Well, its got to be said again-   IS part of the royalty of real jazz festivals in Europe.   
Check out the program.  Absolutely outstanding.       
And probably on the finest part of Lake Geneva too.   
Plenty of ""Off"" gigs in about 12-ish wine caves dotted around the wine village, besides the more head line gigs by some real jazz monsters.
		 
			
			The festival is now, until next Saturday (Saturday 02.04.2011)   
I was there today (Sunday 27.03) with my wife and daughter (2.5 year old), it was great for a first visit to this village. It's an other one of those beautiful-little-village-of-Lavaux-with-superb-lakeshore-medieval-streets-and-nice-bistrots, and there is even much more for one week. I really liked the pleasant feeling of a festival well organized and fit for the place.   
I and family will go again next Saturday, even if it rains! We also hope to go there one evening this week after work; it should be so lovely if the weather is nice. And, who knows, I may even hear some live band, despite my total lack of interest for jazz music

			I was there Saturday night (26th) and had a great time. Brilliant atmosphere. Would recommend it.

			Is anyone going to the Faithless concert on the 18th of March 2011 in Geneva? I will certainly be heading that way but was wondering if any other EFers are too. Maybe we could get together?
		    Hi Starbug, Where are you going from? I am in Zürich, don't yet have a ticket, but would like to come, since I love Faithless...    
			
			Hi, decided not to go after all, too far away for me, I live in Interlaken and I would have to couch surf which sucks.
		     
Do you have any tickets to sell ?
		 
			
			No, sold mine already.
		 
			
			Faithless will split up after 15 years, last concert will be in April 8th 2011 /London
		 
			
			Who else is playing with them?
		 
			
			I'd love to go - but I've been suffering from sleepless nights recently ... just can't seem to get much sleep.

			I saw Mogwai on Friday 11th March at the Rote Fabrik Zürich, I enjoyed it but there were large sections of the crowd who were incredibly rude talking all the way through this, even the quieter moments and lulls which are very much part of the music.
		    That's too bad, I would have gone and loved it! I saw The Ex in Rote Fabrik in Bern a few years ago, and the reaction of the public was the same. I think it kinda comes with certain venues, people come to have fun no matter who is playing...   
If you see some more info on Mogwai in CH anytime in the future, please, post it here, ta!
		    A little birdie, well actually one of the dudes from the band, told me they have been booked to play the Montreux Jazz Festival this summer.
		 
			
			Hi,   
I will probably go to listen/watch Mogwai (Rock, Post-Rock) at Grabenhalle St Gallen the 3rd of june. 
Is there anyone who would like to join ? 
I didn't find someone interested in that kind of strange, without lyrics music...
		    We would definitely go, Mogwai kicks as   but it just too far for us  .. Enjoy the gig!
		 
			
			Any idea on how much tickets are and their availability?? I havent been to a gig for soooo long.
		 
			
			aye I think I'll go -30chf on the door-opens 20.00 support starts at 20.30-usually no problem to get tickets at the venue - (I sneak down to the 24 hr petrol station 1 min away and stock up with beer-they never search you or care if you drink cans inside !),it's non-smoking now -
		 
			
			Will you be catching a train or driving, I would drive by my partner needs the car for the evening......
		 
			
			mmm...is simon mini sale asking me ;kymosabi if i drive or catch train ?if so I won't be coz i live in SG 5 mins from the venue...!

José used to teach at the Conservatoire in Geneva- the only left handed player to teach at that Level (10 strings). He has played at the Paléo and Montreux Jazz festival and most major festivals in CH. Google him for a sample and hope some of you make it to one of the concerts.

		    @Odile - I am interested to know what your friend's guitar playing style is, please?  Also is there a website?   
I really love Spanish flamenco guitar music and the whole flamenco thing and was wondering if it's similar?   
Thanks.

			Anyone got any experiences about the Z7 Konzerfabrik in Pratteln? I'm going to go see Finntroll tomorrow and was wondering what the place is like, prices for beers (if they sell), etc.
		 
			
			Z7 is my favourite place for concerts. They have a bar, I guess a beer is still around 4.- Fr. 
It's not too big but always a great atmosphere. You always meet new people or see people you know. It's a very nice place to go, and the only bigger place with always good music.    
Check out their homepage    
Have fun. \m/    
			
			Finally - a place that looks like it could provide decent muzaks...   
Cheers    
			
			Great place, out in an industrial estate. Don't expect gourmet cuisine or real nice hand cloths in the bathroom, but an excellent venue for progressive, rock and metal. I've seen a ton of bands playing the Z7 including Journey, Porcupine Tree, Riverside, Pure Reason Revolution and Jadis to name just a few.
		 
			
			Atrocious management, but they bring in some decent bands. I quit going there because of the management.
		 
			
			I have been there several times, and I enjoyed the concerts.   
Tesla was the band that I saw there.  The crowd was pretty 
well-behaved.   
Beer?  I don't remember how much it cost.
		 
			
			Always reminds me of going down the student union - kind of grubby and dingy, beer in plastic cups, but great all the same. Hubby is there tonight watching Blaze.
		 
			
			Never been there but I'm looking forward to seeing Eluveitie, Moonsorrow and !ULVER! there, all in March. Can't wait... 
Anyone going to any of these?
		 
			
			Been there a few times, for Devin Townsend, Paul Gilbert to mention a couple.   
Really good venue. + a 0.5L Guinness was 5 chf last month!   
Going again in March to see Nevermore, SymphonyX and their supports.   
From my experience in CH so far the ony other venue that I find equally good (acoustics and 'vibe') is Salzhaus in Winthertur.
		 
			
			nice, ""proper"" rock barn, nice atmophere. It was awfully loud though, bring ear protection if you can (..and you can...""musicians"" ear protection is only a few francs!)
		 
			
			Love that place! One of the best places for gigs in Switzerland I think. Might be going to see Die Apokalyptischen Reiter with Turisas or maybe Gamma Ray later on?   
From what I can recall the beer is around 6-7 francs for 0.5L.

			Hi All, can anyone recommend any jazz clubs in Zürich or at least some jazz nights at certain venues? Thanks for any help in advance! Does any one also know of any open mike nights?
		 
			
			This places sometimes has Jazz         
			
			Here's a results search page for links to posts on  .   
Several EFers, including me, went to the one held at  , opposite Bahnof Wiedikon, Zurich on January 16, 2011.  It was a lot of fun!
		    Saw Tania Maria perform there.  Excellent gig!
		 
			
			Trattoria And Soul Retaurant usually has good acts on but only on Thursday and Friday nights and not in the summer. 
There used to be a place called The Jazz Room (or Place) near Paradelplatz open every night as well as Caa in the Niederdorf (more soul than jazz). Both these places have lamentably closed. 
There is a restaurant called Blue Note that has jazz but I haven't been there yet. There are also jazz nights at the Widder Bar but I think these nights are more of a piano bar style. 
Moods has already been mentioned. 
Not sure abour open mic nights, but there are a few musos on the Expats in Zurich  Yahoo Group who often advertise Open Mic nights.
		        I've been to a couple of JazzBaragge events. The place is 
called Musikklub Mehrspur, very near to Bellevue tram stop. 
It's a pretty cool club, has nice and relaxed ambience.   
The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday sessions are free of 
charge; at least, I've never been asked to pay an entrance 
fee. Perhaps they have a fee at special events.
		    Yeah.  Been there too.  Agree on the coolness factor etc.  I've only ever been on a Wednesday night and can confirm entrance was free.   
It's run by a dude called Dave Feusi who plays sax for  - a really neat Swiss funk/soul/RnB band.    
			
			Thanks very much I've been there of course but more for paid up concerts. I also found this place, has anyone been here?       
			
			it's a while since i lived in Zürich,    
used to have some good concerts
		 
			
			thanks very much, lofty, that looks extremely interesting, it looks like they have all sorts playing there.
		 
			
			On the first Friday of each week, you have the   
in the Sternen Oerlikon   
Really nice !   
Entrance is FREE, but you of course are to consume at least a beverage. But the Sternen 
is not expensive, and their wines and meals are of good quality
		 
			
			thanks, that looks interesting, I may check it out tomorrow. It looks more traditional but I welcome any live music at all!
		    Sorry just couldn't resist.....How many Fridays do you have each week? 
:-)
		 
			
			A new club will open today at Zwinglistrasse. Open to public from friday. 
They will play mainly 50's and 60's Soul and Jazz:

			Cool Kiwis The Phoenix Foundation are hitting Zurich at Komplex ( ) on Friday 18.02.11...so I'll be there to show them some home-grown support. Anyone else?   
Shameless self-promotion: I have a Zurich music blog ( ) and I have some free tix to give away for the gig if anyone is interested?       
			
			I'm gutted! I love the phoenix foundation and only just saw this  
Were they amazing? (I'm slightly hoping you'll tell me they were rubbish...)
		 
			
			they were great...but if it's any consolation there were major sound problems with the PA system at the venue, with the speakers degenerating into an awful ear-ripping Black Noise of Death (which blew out the microphones) every so often. They valiantly struggled on through, though. Ended on a semi acoustic 'Nest Egg' - lovely. Sorry you missed it! Don't worry, they will be back, sometime.
		 
			
			Sounds wonderful (except the black noise of death... not so wonderful).  
Glad it was a good one, though still a bit green with envy.  
I'm hoping to get along to some gigs soon... just learning to find where to get the best info at the moment!     
			
			This page is really helpful, and is for all around Switzerland:       
or, *cough cough* my blog:       
Have fun!    
			
			Thanks! Both look excellent - goldmines of gig info  
p.s if you're not already going, i thoroughly recommend Belle&Sebastian. I've never seen such an array of instruments on one stage at once, all being used!
		 
			
			^ Belle & Sebastian - of course I am going!   They have been a favourite of mine since the 'Tigermilk' days. I loved them at Zurich Open Air. A pity they are playing at X-Tra (that soulless place) - Plaza would have been so much nicer. But oh well, I'll take what I can get.  
Maybe we should have a EF meet-up?
		 
			
			Good plan! EF gig-going group

I'm going to check out those lists and get booking!

			Hi,   
I'm not sure if this is the right forum to post this in, but it seems to the most relevant (but mods, please feel free to move it into the appropriate oneif necessary)...I hope you don't mind me plugging myself a little    
For the past year or so I've maintained a Zurich music blog:       
My tastes run mainly to indie/pop/rock-kind of stuff. I do lots of reviews and interviews (all in English!), news round-ups and sometimes have free stuff. I got frustrated at not being able to find out info in English about up-coming gigs, so I started my own blog to redress that. There is so much good music that comes to Zurich, I didn't want to miss any of it.   
So if you are interested, check it out - maybe I'll see some of you at a concert one day?   
Cheers 
Cherie
		 
			
			Anyone else going to Hurts @ x-tra Zurich Monday 21.02.11? Big, glorious pop symphonies!

			This looks great!!  I wish there was the same for Basel!!!  Once we get settled and start to understand public transportation we'll need to head to Zurich for a few gigs!   
When we first moved here a band we know from Glasgow 'The Cinematics' played in zurich (October 2010) but it was the day we moved here and never managed to get across.   
If you know of any good indie/pop bands coming to Basel please let me know.
		 
			
			Maybe you could go along anyway - I'm sure there will be a few people selling tix outside?
		 
			
			Thanks, Suzy! Let me know if you come to Zurich, we can meet up and enjoy the roar of the crowd (well, the subdued appreciation - this is Switzerland after all  ) together. I'll keep an eye out on Basel goodies for you.

			Loved her stuff from the 70's! Would love to see if she still has it... I see it is an acoustic show. Interesting. Lenny Kaye was quite a good guitarist. Thanks for the tip.   
fduvall         Thanks for flagging this Bertrand. I always get jealous when I see all of the Zurich gig messages on here. Of note this looks like a pretty cool mini festival. If you go to the homepage there is a guy called Jose Gonzalez playing, who is being supported by a group called Woodpigeon. I have seen both of these a few times in the UK and cannot wait to see them over here  I am going to be booking up some tickets tonight I think.     Thanks again    
			
			I plan to see her locally in the UK in a couple of weeks. These are the notes from the venue.

			love patti. i.ve seen her a ton in nyc, grew up seeing her and have been to a ton of her poetry events as well- so great in concert and a nice woman too, went to see her read poetry once in westport connecticut with my son when he was about 6 months old and afterwards she came over and played with him and bounced him around. nice to see the mama side of her, but i really love the spitting, shoekicking patti. i just hope the shows here are as intimate as what i'm used to in nyc, people seem to tell me she is very different in concert there -a lot of interaction with people,  talking about her songs and politics, etc.  
how was it in zuri last time- the venue and whatnot...thanks
		 
			
			She was just so cool! The way she stood there, draped over her mic, like she'd been born to be on stage. Please let me be half that cool when I'm her age. 
It was outside on the lake at the Rote Fabrik. Her voice was strong and she sang, talked and recited poetry. I was sat up on the roof with a view of the sunset and the mountains.  
Best concert of the year for me. And this was my favourite song from the concert.         
			
			awesome.sold. i was worried somehow that the feeling would be more formal or something, but she is so natural and cool up there, it's true. hope she does horses and southern cross, i could go on  !!!   
maybe we'll see y'all in gva then!
		 
			
			She didn't do Horses, I was waiting.... she did do Gloria! I was happy. Finished with Rock n Roll Nigger.
		 
			
			yay for gloria! she does that a lot and its always awesome!!! esp excited because it's acoustic, that should be great, though a different thing from her real rock and roll concert feeling- if you decide to go, we'll make a pre show drinks event    
			
			I'd love to, but Geneva?!?      
			
			it's not such a long way- have a rest on the train and you'll be fine!    
and the hall looks quite beautiful; i think it'll be a good show-    
			
			Thanks for posting this info Bertrand.  I saw her about years ago at one of my favourite venues, the Enmore Theatre in Sydney.  She was amazing, totally the coolest woman ever.  Definitely worth booking the babysitter for this one in Feb.
		 
			
			Thought about it for a couple of seconds, then remembered my job doesn't finish early enough on fridays to get there in time. I'll just have to remember her as she was on the lake in Wollishofen! 
I hope you all have fun.        It's actually a beautiful building. It had been built by the British Consul and dedicated to his sovereign, Queen Victoria     
a bit of history (in English), if you are interested     
			
			welll, looks like we can put an event for pre-drinks on the train from lausanne! yay!    
			
			Does anyone have a spare ticket to this that I could buy?  Patti Smith is my absolute hero and I'm desperate to go, but I only just heard about this gig! 
Thanks, 
Kate
		 
			
			one of the best shows ever!!! victoria hall was absolutely gorgeous and patti smith got the swiss audience out of their seats, dancing, singing and stomping until she said, i can't sing anymore!

			just an FYI and too funny to pass up!!    
I believe its an 80s party featuring David Hasselhoff and Baywatch Soundsystem.   
Palace Club At Riders Palace 
Laax, Switzerland 
26 Feb 2011   
I think I will be going (dependent on work travel) with a local friends or two of mine. Should be a good laugh at least and tickets are only about 40CHF.
		 
			
			I'm going to this, he's very good live
		 
			
			Nuke it form orbit, it's the only way to be sure.
		 
			
			Cyrus, this is my favourite Hass song:       
			
			Luckily, My work PC has no sound and won't play youtube videos, finally I discovered the real reason why.
		 
			
			no problem I can send you a burnt CD if you like?
		 
			
			Could always use more coasters
		    i managed 39 seconds before ripping out my eyes.
		    Including one Floorburger
		    I admire your pain threshold - I only got to 35    
			
			48 seconds, probably have a high pain threashold from being married so long
		    brave man.. won't get that far.. 
Judging by the screams, he is loved..only question is by who..        
			
			Yes, not ""IN"" to like him.
		 
			
			The Hoff will be in   tomorrow night. Much closer to Luzern.    
			
			Hahaha, awesome.  
Tomorrow I cant, but Sunday ~maybe!
		 
			
			have a look at youtube at this brillant video: 
David Hasselhoff Drunk, Banned Carl's Jr. Commercial
		 
			
			this is amazing. see you there.
		 
			
			I thought he was only popular in Germany and Japan    
			
			He's hot to look at, or perhaps it is the memories of the crush I had on him in Night Rider which make him hot in my eyes even now... some of the things he says though (on America's Got Talent) simply ooze cheese, makes it hard to want to see him in concert.    
When he's being normal though, instead of being ""on"" I like how he speaks and carries himself.    
So far as drunk and disorderly and whatnot, I think folks would have a hard time finding too many people who haven't been sloppy intoxicated at some point, thankfully the rest of us don't (typically) have someone recording it for posterity.
		    WTF of the day Peg!
		    Well, different tastes for different folks     
He's got a very nice speaking voice and a great smile, without being ""braces perfect.""   
He also has pretty eyes, although I don't care for the lifts, I don't like how it changes the shape of the eyes (on anyone). I guess they can't all be comfy enough in their own skin (or perhaps the support of the love of their life for 50 yrs) to grow old ""gracefully,"" like Paul Newman.
		    According to the forum owners its now "" !!! of the day ..""     
Needles to say , I saw Baywatch,but i sure wasn't looking for The Hoff his blue eyes    
			
			tbf he is eye candy for the ladies
		    To the Swiss ladies perhaps, due to the mullet:        
			
			managed the whole video..   
but then again I had to think of 2g1c to do it...
		 
			
			this is my favourite photo:       
			
			Mine this one       
			
			What's wrong with that?  
Look at Charlie Sheen (same lifestyle), yet he seems to be the idol of the whole world.
		    Far from it, he gets away with more.. who knew Charlie from Two and half men was actualy playing his real life soap..    
Money is no excuse to behave like that.. yet he gets away with it..   
Never understood why Hoff his daughters posted that picture online, could have been a way to bring him back also, all set in scene..who knows..

The times are Saturday at 14:30 and 19.00 and Sunday at 11:00 and 14:30 I think. Prices are from 35CHF.  Also if you have a coop card you get a discount didn't know that until we went to get tickets at a ticket office.   
Hope this helps.

Yeah I love the fish too.
		    Think you mean Phish.
		    erm, actually no.  Their official website lists Fish... and they have no religious songs (as far as I know) like Phish do.
		     
Phish sucks.  I for one am glad they are no longer together.  I once had a phish head for a roommate.  Never again.
		 
			
			...""I think I'll have myself a beer...'   
I saw them in 2005, and they still had the energy, and the skills.  Ska kind of had its heyday and decline, but I have always liked Reel Big Fish.
		 
			
			Used to listen to RBF in uni (college) days!  What memories...    
			
			Phish is back together, they played the Garden on NYE
		 
			
			Hey everyone just wanted to let you know Reel Big Fish was coming to town next week. February 11th at Arbat starts at 8 30, doors open at 8. Hope to see some people there jamming. They are a ska band from California.

			Hi all  
Thanks to a very nice lady on the English forum i could go with the kids  
to the Linkin park concert tonight   
First of all, i never heard their music , 
second of all, i had no interest to do so    
I did not enjoy the music, tried to pick up the words 
heard once or twice F words   
There were two quiet songs where the musicians were able to actually  
show that they can play music and not just bang on the drums or guitar   
I found the music not really pleasant or moving in any way 
the audience was mostly teenagers  
like my two    
I feel sad that my kids dont like classical music at all and dont even  
give it a chance  
because i would like them to know that classical music is the base  
for all music and then i would also like someone to come with me  
i dont know anyone who likes classical music   
Anyway , do you think it might be too late for teenagers to ever like  
classical music ?   
I might have been a nerd but i went to classical music concerts 
as a teenagers with a friend( also a nerd )    
What are the chances i may be able to save their souls ?   
Do you think Linkin park is just social pressure , peer pressure and all that  
or do you think they make good music ? if so why?   
Is there anyone out there who likes classical music but has no one  
around who likes to tag along ? If so please let me know
		 
			
			P.S.   
 I meant to thank the lady from the English forum who took our dog  
so we could go to the concert and not have psycho neighbor contact the psycho rent lady again  about the dog howling
		 
			
			Firstly, don't assume because some is banging their guitars or drums hard that it doesn't take a high level of skill to do what they're doing.   
That said, I think Linkin Park are a horrible band devoid of even a smidgen of originality or musical talent.    
Teenagers will always listen to manufactured rubbish no matter what and trying to stop them from listening to it will only make it seem cooler to them. Sooner or later they will get into music with a bit more class or they'll become bankers.
		   O please... Its not that bad. I am by no means a teenagers; although I have been listening to Linkin Park since I was one. I think most young people can appreciate classical music (I did). So why can't you appreciate something different?      This whole post/topic just seems so old fashioned. Even my 60 year old parents can value and listen to Linkin Park.   
			
			Music is and will always be subjective to our own tastes, likes and dislikes, I enjoy all styles of Music from Classical to Heavy metal, there are certain I dislike greatly such as salsa music, whereas many people love this music I do not.   
I like Linkin Park's music a lot and have a couple of their albums, they were pioneers of what is called New Metal, combining electronic, heavy metal and rap, the lyrics of their songs are often wrought out of their own personal experience and a lot of people from various age groups are able to relate to. Chester Bennington the lead singer is a very talented vocalist, guitarist and pianist, and writes most of the lyrics and music for the band. This is why I like them.   
Musical styles I enjoy listening to are: Rap, Hip-Hop, classical, classic rock, indie rock, alternative rock and punk, ska, reggae, soul, funk, disco, pop, electro, house and dance to name just a few.   
Either you like it or you don't!
		 
			
			I thought Linkin Park only had one song  . Oh well, in the end it doesn't even matter.
		    Zero if you keep banging on like this at them. 
Seriously, have you any idea what you sound like?   
The whinning dirge of your classical music sounds just as awful to them as their music sounds to you & they will never, ever give it a chance whilst you try to ram it down their throats whilst calling their music shit. 
(although inadvertantly, you've hit the nail on the head as far as Linkin Park go - they'll move on shortly).   
Take it from someone who's parents only ever played classical & dismissed anything else as ""that dreadful racket"" and is only just beginning to appreciate some clasical at nearly 40.
		 
			
			To some, the Beatles are ""classical"" these days. Listening to Vivaldi or Rossini was my thing as a teenager and then I discovered Pink Floyd. The Italian wrinklies didn't stand much of a chance thereafter. Let the kids be, better that they have some kind of interest in music, whatever kind of noise they say they like. Peer pressure and the mass media hype most of the crap that teenagers listen to these days. When they grow up they'll develop a taste for something that really means something deeper to them and it probably won't be Linkin Park.
		    Pioneers? Actually they caught onto the coattails of what was imho an altogether uninspired genre. Talented vocalist? have you ever seen them perform live? Oh well, like you say, different strokes..
		    You're wrong (sorry). They are not pioneers of nu-metal, that, er, distinction falls as far back to bands like Biohazard and Faith no More, who were both forging that path in the 80s.    
To the OP, to try and open the door with your kids and classical music, maybe try and get them to note things like  , pairing their music with the San Francisco Symphony.
		    Agreed. Linkin Park came someone at the peak of the Nu Metal wave, and it rapidly declined afterward.   
But what I would give for another Faith No More album.
		 
			
			I'd say, it's pretty late to start pushing some classical stuff on your teens now, when they are already interested in other stuff, way cooler for them (or, let them at least think it is... ). You won't ever win them over if you express the slightest disapprovement of what they like and whine to them. F word these days in music is...pretty normal. I guess that's LP little rebellion, makes me chuckle. If I lived closer I'd go with you to a classical gig, fo sho. Have it on, listen to it at home and car (while you let their muzzak to be heard, that's a must, 50/50), maybe point out what you like about it, teens are amazingly perceptive and actually open to loads of new things. They will listen to you if you listen to them. I think the only way to influence them is to take an active interest in what they like already even if you think it's shite, talk about it with them, go with them to gigs (that's awesome you went!), go to shops with them to look for more, have them educate you and do a little research on your own, u tube is your friend..I took my mom to a punk gig at 15, it was so fun, she got into it and made loads of buddies, dad likes electronica, dub and regae now (well, it's his choice, ugh), it's funny how youth influence older generation...Parents need to widen their choice, too, it's not only us trying to push something on teens, they already have their taste and don't worry, it will most likely change fast. Linking Park plays out very quickly (sorry, LP fans). It's not like it's wrecking them, anyways. It may be the minute you express an interest in LP they quit liking it and turn over to classical, hahaha...Another way to classical is to get them an instrument, sign up to music school or take lessons, some kids move from rock to more classical stuff. At the end of the day, it does not matter if they hit drumms in their room or pull off some piccicato on violins, as long as they like it.
		    I think we can find some middle ground here...how about some  ?
		    You can go further than Apocolyptica. The Vitamin String Quartet that has a bunch of tribute albums, including 3 for Linkin Park.       
I have several and they are....interesting.
		 
			
			After telling the OP that she should try and introduce classical with Metallica's S&M's concert, I decided to take a look for a few videos. Now, I quit being a Metallica fan when they released their second album (ah, even then I knew they were going to be a commercial band   ) but I'm just so impressed with the whole production of it all.   
Starshine, here's your gateway drug:        
			
			Well, they are back together and touring, so you never know...       
			
			I wonder if we are just scaring her now....     
I like old Metallica, only. Apocalyptica is alrite for teens, I guess, but they might cringe at all the theatrics. Part of the Linking Park appeal is their pseudo r&r image (clothes, moves, the silly DJing bit), all the screaming, the music is actually tame and poppy, complety overarranged and overproduced.
		    Given my experience with music it might be too early. Musical tastes mature as you get older. I ignored classical music until I was in my twenties. IMO an attempt to introduce a teenager to a form of music that they're not interested in, and is considered not to be hip and trendy by their peers, is not going to be very successful if my attitudes at the time are anything to go by.   
If they've a genuine interest in music then they'll discover classical at some point. Musical taste is quite a personal thing, and IMO is best left to the individual to discover.
		 
			
			There is common ground between your music and theirs - guaranteed.  But if you want to encourage some crossover interest,   got to find that common ground and play it up, cause they're perfectly happy with the way things are.     
So what do   like about classical music?   
Is it the grand romantic sweep of Beethoven? 
Is it the poppy, catchy tunes you can whistle, like Mozart? 
Is it all the complex, overtly intellectual Baroque stuff, lots of little embroidery going on in the background?   
Or what kind of music do   like, and what do they like about it?  Dig beyond ""it's cool""/""it's just noise"" and look for musical similarities.     
Get them to recommend some music that they think might possibly suit you, and give it a listen.  Even if it doesn't, it might be slightly more tolerable for you to listen to while you try to suss out the musical influences and similarities.... Try to compare it mostly to 20th-century classical composers. You're much more likely to find echoes of Mahler in your kids' music than shades of Palestrina.  Not that the Palestrina isn't ultimately there but it's not going to be as direct or obvious.   
Next pick a band of theirs, find out who the major influences were - and who influenced   bands, and so on.  Listen to all of it.  Eventually you'll get to the Beatles (practically guaranteed), and then brass band music, and - well, that's   classical, isn't it?     
Essentially I guess I'm suggesting a DIY music appreciation course aimed at really understanding the link between their music and yours, instead of just positing that one exists.  If you don't understand it you are not gonna be able to make them see it either.  
 If that sounds too much like work go and read some of Alex Ross's stuff, e.g. the collection of essays "" "" - and then listen to some of it.       You can help, though. While I agree it really is very personal and some find classical through pop or rock, some the other way around, it does not hurt to try and expose. I wouldn't try too hard and too obviously, though, since it is a turn off for teens, fo sho. Nonchalantly try.      
You can also have a teen who will do anything to be different than his stereotypical teen peers. Some teens so go for being different, what ever it means. If you play it right, exposing them to classical might be exactly the difference (the new uncool and untrendy) they will opt for to make themselves stick out of the blob. I enjoyed classical, but also appreciated help I got from others in terms of interesting choice to experiment with (parents, teachers, music classes, gigs, etc.).
		     Linkin Park has been around for years..and years and years. There not one hit wonders.      The whole thing about this thread that so annoys me is that the OP is so set in this whole..""this young generation..with their crappy music"" thing completely enrages me.      The problem with ""your"" generation is that you are far to narrow minded. Anyone under the age of about 30 is the iPod/iTunes generation..and I find we are much more open to different genres of music. Whereas I find people over 30 tend to get too caught up in the whole classificationI listen to .. there for I am      It just so silly..good music is good music. Dont get so caught up in the whole who am I if someone knows I listen too    
			
			You could also download some music appreciation bits for car rides, and tell them it is for you (maybe they will unplug their ears and leave their ipods alone for a bit... )...      does some wonderful programs with classical music, they also have Proms on tv every now and then, it's catchy and very likeable.
		       It's a development thing, teenagers these days find it difficult to find out what sounds good or is edgy or new, because it all sounds the same, all written by the man for the almighty dollar, the 12 year old market is big bucks.     I used to listen to linkin park, (well the first album anyway), but at uni I got more into what my parents had been listening to when they where younger, led zeppelin, Lynyrd skynyrd, bands that had ballads and complex tunes.   I think the change in music has come from a lack of emphasis on learning classical techniques by newer bands.     Also learning an instrument yourself can help you understand music, and broaden your musical horizons.     To put it bluntly Bach or Chopin can induce a multitude of emotions and is similar to reading (with full understanding) Dostoevsky or Tolstoy, linkin park is more of a 'Dan Brown'.   
			
			Oh and just to be a pedant, Bach is Baroque period music and Chopin is Romantic period music, neither one is 'Classical music'.
		    Ok. Now that's the biggest pedantry I have seen here, hahaha...Far worse than the odd little grammar pokes that some get off by..
		 
			
			music snobs are worse than wine snobs.
		                  Yep.

To the OP , get them rock band or guitar hero. It has a lot of good songs that can get them into some good 'ol rock. Eventually they'll figure their way out to something like this:       
			
			All snoberry sucks.          
(the worst snobs are those who snear at you eating cold, cold! french fries... )   
On the other hand, just because I find Linking Park boring does not make one snob. Personal taste. Saying how terrible it is in people's faces is snoberry, I agree, that's pretty rare, though. Guys in my bands were killing me over the snob muzzak fights, who has more records, who's complete, who ordered what, brag brag brag..At the end of the day, they didn't seem more into music than people who don't get off by collecting. So, it is all about experiencing it, even if your buddie dislikes it. Just live the music, consume it.
		    agreed.  having preferences is fine, but snobbery begins once those preferences are used to judge those of others.  i'm not a fan of linkin park but i completely understand how others can like them.  and i'm not going to get into a pissing contest with another person trying to find the most obscure album of an obscure band to prove how i, and the bands i listen to, havent sold out to the Man.
		 
			
			Yeah, that's true. It's actually really irritating, it shows more googeling and utubing skills than anything else...  People are willing to trademark their search enging results, almost, just to one up the other. Cracks me up.              
On the other hand, if it's obsure, gimme. Interesting obscure. Not obscure for the coolness factor   Hahaha, we bunch of fussy weirdos.
		 
			
			Well I'm going to raise the snobbery bar a bit and say the only thing Faith No More was good for was to finance Patton's proper musical endeavours..
		    Yeap. Couldnt agree more. As someone said earlier, music is so subjective. Doesnt mean that someone who likes Rhianna, the Killers or Linkin Park says that they've got terrible taste in music. As for saying that these bands are talentless - well, they've performed to sell-out crowds in many stadiums around the world and you're bitching about them behind your computer screen. Who's the b***ch now?         If you want to attend classical concerts, go to meetup.com. There's a group who meets up for classical concerts in the Tonehalle regularly. Alternatively, nothing wrong at all with attending it yourself. More often than not, I still cant find people to attend classical concerts with (even in my 30s - so its not just teenagers who arent into classical music!) and I am quite happy going alone.    
As for ""saving their souls"", what are you, a Sunday school teacher??   Music is subjective - and during your teenage years, it is also part peer pressure. I was teased awfully back then because I wasnt into New Kids On the Block and preferred Axl Rose and his posse, Skid Row, Warrant and the likes. I was even more uncool because I was into classical music at the same time. Lets turn this thing on its head -    
Now, I personally like Linkin Park's music - and no I am not a teenager  (physically). Their fusion of nu and rap metal is pretty neat and the  reason why they stand out is because they made it so radio friendly. I  also really like the band members side projects - for example, Fort  Minor which is Mike Shinoda's baby, is more hip hop. Again, not  everyone's cuppa tea because oh, its full of cussing    
At the end of the day, you can bring a horse to water but you cant force it to drink.
		    Like  ? Is that subculture even known on this side of pond?   
High Fidelity summed up music snobbery nicely:           Blasphemy!!!!!!!!!   
			
			Oh look, it's just about being open. Your kids will like what they like, but they have a greater chance of learning to love other types of music, if you show that you, too, are prepared to experience different music. Your reactions to LP are giving them an example for how to react to the music that they're not familiar with.    
My daughter is 'musical' and played cello, oboe and piano (no conscious effort to play instruments ending with O, despite evidence to the contrary). I learned a great deal about classical music from what she was playing. She gave it up in her mid teens and latched on to the likes of Korn, but has an abiding love for the Beatles, Beethoven and old musicals.    
My son is not musical in the same way, but loves to listen to and experience music. He has introduced me to musicians I would never have heard and who I now love. I love it when he sends me 'mixed tapes to educate Mum'.   
I heard an interview once with an music educator, and he said that if you make the effort to listen to music that you normally wouldn't listen to - even if you don't particularly like it - it helps open pathways in your brain. It was particularly relevant to me at the time, as my husband had just had a brain hemorrhage and brain surgery. I like to think that listening to a wide range of music has helped his recovery.
		 
			
			seriously... teens don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band... it ain't what they call rock and roll...
		    Hahah, yeah. Nice buttcrack right there...   
Hipsters, you mean beatnicks and all? I am tired of scene that only throws a revolution since they need to negate something, rebel against something, define themselves through rejection and do not use their own palate, taste and appreciation skills as a point of reference. Snobs. When people need to invent something to be better than others...snoberry wouldn't exist if they didn't have the audience to show off to and snear at. It's silly.    
Selling giants music halls does not say anything about the quality of music. About marketing, good PRing, having sufficient support, knowing what teens want, pc skills, whatever they need to sell it to the average taste. I am not against it, who I am to preach, whatever rocks people's boat...Do I enjoy it? No. And I don't find them tallented at all, corny ear candy. It's too easy to create a wall of sound with a big band and all the technology and resources, any mildly skilled kid could do that. But if people like it, why not? I give them credit for knowing how to make giant cash. I like some bad quality stuff, imensely. But I wouldn't give it a medal for originality, hahaha..Nor feel special and rebellious for listening to it. In fact, I don't feel rebellious listening or playing anything. Midly, ripping some odd drowny tunes in a Pilgrim outfit and Princess Lea's buns or yodelling with locals, but that is so fun.
		 
			
			I really don´t like Linkin Park, either. 
All their songs are pretty much the same, the guy may have a good voice but after 17 songs sang exactly identical it gets boring.   
There are so many good (better) bands out there.
		 
			
			So to get back to the OP, I always enjoy contributing to discussions about music.  Especially when it's one as original and unique as ""Music of a previous generation >>> music of this generation""    
Linkin Park?? Don't worry, there are certainly more obnoxious bands out there...   
As for getting the kids to listen to classical music, my music teacher at school was a big fan of the classic Warner Bros cartoons (google ""What's Opera Doc"").  Though maybe they are a little too old for Bugs Bunny, in which case you could maybe try to go via movies which have classical music featuring in key scenes.  E.g. Platoon, Clockwork Orange, Rollerball, and of course:              
*coughs*pot..black*coughs*    And I would like to convey my annoyance at your generalisation on behalf of everyone over 30.             
			
			Back to the OP: When I was a teenager, i listened to far more annoying stuff than LP.   
The secret is: They like it because adults don't. End of story. Teenagers want to be different and to take Mum to a concert must be the worst... in short: If you want them to change their mind, you could pretend to like the music - and they will move on to something else, probably worse. You will not be able to make them like what you want them to like - and I honestly think that parents should not try to do that with teenagers. Mine tried, failed miserably and I am still today unhappy that they did not allow me to learn the guitar instead of what they thought is good.
		     
Exhibit A :       vs         vs         vs        vs       I think that teenagers shouldn't skip any stage in building their character. All the things (like music genres, clothing, styles) are there because it helps building a personal and strong character.   
I remember that I was listening to Metallica, Iron Maiden, Sepultura, etc. while my father was always encouraging me to listen to some more ""quality"" music like jazz-rock or classical. At that time I wasn't giving a sh**t about this type of music but later on I discovered Al Jarreau and everything changed.   
I think that is very important to support your kids in discovering on their own what is classical music, to go through all stages and get a well structured music culture. Classic music is not for all ages.   
Believe me, we all need to go through many genres as possible in order to get to a point where you can say: I liked rock, I liked techno, I liked drum and bass, but now I finally found ""this""!
		    I do too. It was this morning.
		 
			
			I remember when Linkin Park came to Montreal... 
I had no interest in seeing them but a band I like (Coheed and Cambria) was opening for them. So I dished out the premium because LP was the lead band but only went to see C&C. I left after LP's first song and got a bunch of wierd looks as I was leaving.
		 
			
			King George VI liked Mozart   
My parents liked Bing Crosby and Glen Miller   
I liked Beatles, Stones, Elvis   
My children liked Pink Floyd, Queen   
My grandson likes Linkin Park very much & went to the concert Monday.   
You have to move on! They may or may not like some classical music, but you won't persuade them, they will just hate you.
		    I'm doing it also when going to the gym: play some Pantera and Slipknot and you push like hell!!   
			
			Perhaps you need to make the transformation or compromise from Classical Music to Rock. 
Nice orchestra, a traditional wedding and funeral in the video.          Is spot on! I am 19, and listened to Linkin Park when I was younger, I prefer their older stuff, but the newer stuff isnt that good to be honest.   
As for classical it totally depends on the person, I was lucky enough to have my mum who listened to it. Saying that teenagers are young and want to listen to 'Pop' music, and by pop i mean popular.    
I can appreciate every type of music, be is Ska, Rock, Pop, Punk, Folk, Country, 'Screamo,' but I have to ask you one question....   
Would you get up on stage and 'Bang' the guitar and drums in the way they do it? Because that is where the talent is, having the guts to get up on stage and perform in front of 1000's of people.   
I take music very seriously, and was quite insulted by the comments you made about Linkin Park to be honest, but I know that everyone is entitled to an opinion about their type of music, but you have to appreciate that right?   
Ah, rant over        
Actually banging on drums IS the base for all music.   
I dont think the early primates had cellos.
		 
			
			I am 42 and do hear linkin park, but the last cd is not my type of music(exept one song(blackout), I like Rise Against, My Chemical Romance; Foo Fighters, 
Good Charlotte; Janelle Monae , Green Day, Sum 41, The Gaslight Anthem, The Hives and from the older ones: 
Rolling Stones, Depeche Mode, ZZ Top, Steve Winwood, The Police, Talking Heads, John Mellencamp

			Hi everyone, I'm putting this under daily life because it's such short notice and perhaps more eyes will see this.    
Tomorrow, Sunday, Dec 5, I will give a free concert at the Sacre-Coeur Church in Basel, on Feierabendstrasse. The name of our baroque ensemble is ""Les Fabulists"" and we will be playing a short program of pre-Classical oboe sonatas from little-known composers from Italy, France, and England. The program won't be very long and is really suited to a lazy Sunday, as we'll be playing at 11:30 AM, after the mass. Just perfect for the time right between your first and second breakfasts.   
As mentioned, the concert is free (though donations are gratefully accepted), and is an easy way to get some culture into your diet! No need to RSVP, just show up if you're in the area. Hope to see some of you there. Go ahead and introduce yourself if you do decide to come.

			Kissin will be playing pretty much the same program in Basel on 29.11   so if you miss him in Lucern, you have another option. 
Schiff played Schumann in Basel and now similar program in Lucern
		    Tickets are a shade cheaper as well. Buggeration!    
What are the acoustics like for the Stadtcasino? Any recommended seating area?  Never tried but must do so one of these days.
		 
			
			Acoustic is not bad (you can hear ambulances sometimes for example so the insulation needs improvement) but otherwise quite acceptable. I usually prefer the balcony on the left.  
Haven't been in Lucern's KKL so cannot compare.  
Not surprised about the price difference though    
			
			Am going to the Andràs Schiff one, my stepmother chose it.    
By the way, I'm really not ""au fait"" with Lucerne, any restaurants nearby you could recommend? Since we are going on the train, we'd like to eat before the concert.
		    Sorry not really familiar with Lucerne either. The only things I've done in that city is to visit the KKL and Lucern Pianos down the road for a couple of test drives.   There is a decent restaurant in the KKL itself, where Hash and me had an overdose of a smoked salmon salad the last time. It gets a little crowded pre-concerts so go early. Enjoy Schiff, he's one of the best interpreters of Schumann imho!!    
Anyone going this Friday for Kissin?
		 
			
			Great show last night.  Although do I dare say that sitting near the back of the floor seats, I found the acoustics questionable.   
Emanuel Ax was wonderful.  Watching his fingers was almost as enjoyable as listening.
		 
			
			We're going to a little brasserie nearby now, had looked at RED but I remember it being quite ""airport lounge"" like. Definitely looking forward to not only the concert but also the atmosphere, I visited the KKL during the daytime and they explained the acoustics to us, how the doors work to change the tone etc. but that's not the same.
		     
The month of November is for pianists at the Lucerne Festival.   
Former child prodigy, Evgeny Kissin will be performing, as well as up and coming talents like Alice Sara Ott and Korean pianist, Lee Jin Sang.    
Tickets go on sale at 12 noon on 22nd September. Mark your calenders and book on the day itself. Tickets for the featured acts sell out in hours, some even less.    
Full list of performers here:     
Anyone else planning to go?
		 
			
			Thanks for the heads-up.
		 
			
			Am definitely going for the Kissin one. Let me know if you want to join.

			Hello all, I hope I am posting in the right place... mods please feel free to move it if you want.   
CIRQUE DU SOLEIL are finishing up their VAREKAI tour in Zürich on October 24th.    . 
Area 1 Tickets 30% discount -  Area 2 Tickets 40% discount  - Area 3 Tickets 50% discount.   
I just purchased two tickets for 87.50 CHF each instead of 125 CHF this is the highest discounted area possible. The lowest (but by far means not the worst as if you have ever been to a show you can really see from everywhere) price area tickets are going for   instead of 55 CHF!       - this is the link for the discounted tickets.      is the regular link if you want to compare regular prices. 
I have only heard VERY GOOD THINGS about this show.   
Enjoy   
			
			oh yes forgot to mention... I have been advised that if you do purchase tickets that you should not expect to get any food at or anywhere near the venue. 
They have drinks, popcorn and suspicious looking hotdog like things but otherwise that is it.    
just saying   
			
			Just tried your link and I got ""page not found"" ??
		 
			
			oh yes, I forgot to mention the website with the discount tickets is in German.. just click on   then at the bottom right hand side of the next page you can click on  . Pick the number of tickets you want then click on the area you want to sit in... then you can click on the actual seats you want to book. Very user friendly website.        I just edited the link - it works now 
Here is the direct link right to the  .
		 
			
			Of course I purchased tickets last night for full price...   
Thanks though.
		     Drat, drat, and    
			
			I can confirm it's a great show.    
I had first row tickets and went with my 6 yo daughter. while we could almost hear and feel the artists breathing in the first row, one gets to see more of the show if you sit further back. best rows are probably mid section. here it's not that because you have the most expensive seats you will see more. it's like the first row in a movie theatre.   
nevertheless, again it's a great show, irrespective of where you end up sitting.    
there is a kind of a burger stand close by the vnue, but otherwise it's popcorn and ice cream and sodas.
		    Excellent value for money if you can get a ticket for     as I mentioned previously... nothing much to eat around there....go to Les Halles beforehand    
			
			I just saw it yesterday... great! Really worth it, even full price    
			
			Yes, I agree.  I took my wife to the show in Chicago four years ago and payed throught the nose for front row a bit to the side.  Couldn't really see a lot of acrobatics, etc.       
			
			Just got discounted tickets for the last Friday of the show. I saw a couple of other Cirque du Soleil shows before, and always left quite impressed. Thanks for the heads-up on the discount link, saved me a bunch of chuffs.
		 
			
			Thanks for the heads up, I just booked tickets.
		 
			
			Cirque de soleil show is always fantastic ... I have followed their shows in : HK, Macao and Vienna...amazing experiences for me...sorry I will be on a trip during this time..otherwise 27 CHF its definately worth of it....
		 
			
			Its amazing! Go people   I love the Cirque du Soleil    
			
			Got some tickets, but I could only book in a block of 3 ? I guess my niece is in for a suprise   I saw them years ago in Perth, totally mesmerising...
		 
			
			Just got 2 tickets to the very last show!  Thanks for the infò!        You must have had 3 in the number of tickets in the top right hand corner - on the otherhand your niece will LOVE IT!
		 
			
			Thanks very much for the heads up.  I had avoided due to the high prices, but at this price it will be very much worth it.   
I don't think I've seen them at a main show, which is embarassing for a Canadian.  I saw them before they became famous at some public performance and more recently at the Montreal Jazz Festival, which was amazing.   
Hard to believe a circus founder could become a billionaire and fly into space.
		 
			
			My friend in Vancouver warned me not to get front row seats.  It wasn't due to flying sweat or being pulled on as a volunteer; she still has me guessing why.
		               
I would advise to get tickets ASAP as the discounted ones will sure to be gone soon.      Yup, I am a goose, but one mans goose is anothers fav uncle    
			
			Thanks for the great tip!  Just bought two tickets.  Can't wait.
		 
			
			Awesome, thanks a bunch. With the discount, two tickets + full tank of gas for round trip are cheaper than one ticket the last time they were in Geneva. Gonna keep it a surprise until the morning of the show, my girlfriend's gonna flip.
		    Pun intended, I'm sure.
		 
			
			Great tip! When I told Miss L-P about the tickets she said ""but they are too expensive."". She gets to go with a bf now and 2 chaperones  (like Russkov, that will be a surprise).
		    chaperones ain't cool.. and they can be bribed anyways...
		 
			
			Thanks for the tip Got tickets for Friday
		 
			
			Thanks to all who thanked me here in this thread and an  extra special  thanks goes to those who made the effort to give me a green blobby as thanks!  
I hope we all enjoy the show. I'm going on Thursday.       
			
			thanks a lot for the link. just booked!
		 
			
			We just got back and had an excellent evening (and no chaperoning problems)!     
For those who drive the parking ""Hardturm"" is a 2 minute walk to the tents and is 15 chf's, payable on entry.  Getting out is no problem unlike the Hallenstadium. The drinks at the bar were decent brands and not badly mixed- a nice treat during the 30 minute break.    
			
			We went to see the show on Sunday evening. Great show! Unfortunately we hadn't seen this posting regarding the discount... 
Somehow must have gotten wrong address on Google map, got off at Hardbrucke thinking itnwas the closest bus stop, but it was 20min walk away. The nearest tram station is Hardturm on tram number 4.
		 
			
			I have one ticket for sale for tonight's show at face value of 27.5 CHF (check for sale section). Please PM if interested.
		 
			
			Wow just saw the show... it was PHENOMENAL! There are still discounted tickets available for tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday's shows.... enjoy.
		 
			
			Stupid question: is it obvious which way to walk when exiting the parkhaus to get to the tents?          Not a stupid question at all (we were a bit confused tbh)! There is a walkway on floor two that takes you to the street- go down the stairs and you'll  then see everyone heading to the entry which is about 25m away. Otherwise, go out at the ground floor (where you usually pay); although it does not seem the right way, walk a little further and you'll see everyone.    
We got into the carpark 15 minutes before the show- it was just enough time to make it to our seats without running. The show does start on time and ends at 2200.
		 
			
			How is the view from the 37 CHF tix..should I opt for the $57 ones?!! What does 20 more Francs get you? I want to go on Sunday!
		 
			
			Thanks again zwissmiss went last night really enjoyed it 
We had the tickets for 37.50 and the seats where OK, but in the break(there was some better seats still free) we changed for even better places   
			
			Thank you so much for this post!!  Went on a whim and can't find the discount tickets anywhere except through your link.  Truly the best show I've seen in a long time.  Very good.   
Don't pay for the most expensive seats!  The views were fine anywhere and if the show Sunday is anything like today, there will be plenty of good seats to which you can move.
		 
			
			Went today- wonderful show indeed! For those who'd like to go but still undecided it's really an amazing show, you shouldn't miss the last show tomorrow.
		 
			
			We saw it last year in Geneva, definitely worth the money. 
Too bad we had to go all the way to Geneva if they are in Basel this year... well, that´s life!
		 
			
			Saw yesterday's performance, great show!  Thanks for the info    
			
			Excellent show. The acrobatics was nuts. It must be strange making a living mainly by grasping another man's buttocks with your feet.
		 
			
			Saw the show on Saturday, loved it, the music, the costumes and those crazy acrobats..a flawless production and simply stunning. How they can fly 15 foot through the air and land on someones hand/feet just defies comprehension. I enjoyed this show more than the one I saw years ago in Australia.   
6 yo niece didnt think much of it though, too many disney dvds in her head I suspect and she was constantly looking for a narrative/story/motivations/familar characters  
Next time she stays home.   
A tip to the person that organises the bar. Whats the point of charging 15 chuffs for a spirit mix is no one is going to drink them cos they are too expensive, why pay a couple of people to stand there twiddling their thumbs    
Great show, thanks for the tip Zwissmiss.

			Hey,   
I've recently moved here to Geneva from Birmingham, where there's a quite good music scene, particularly with Open Mic nights and such. I used to try and get to one at least once a week and play a few songs.   
I've so far been unsuccessful in my Google-fu at trying to find a similar thing in Geneva. 
Does anyone else here play their own music and have found any good Open Mic nights or places to play perhaps a support slot for some local bands?   
Thanks,   
Tom
		 
			
			Go to the nearest good music store and ask there, they usually know, plus are often in bands, too. I'd start with a band if I were you, post a flyer at uni (unimail, bastions, etc.) looking for a band. I haven't found that many open mic events compared to what I am used to, but no reason to not do things.

			Dear All,   
I got a chance to attend this very well organized concert/festival by  Union Basel   . The Festival was celebrated with both Indian community residing in Basel as well as the local admirers of Indian culture and dance forms.   
The Festival started with Pooja ""Worshiping Godess Lakshmi ""The Godess of Wealth and Prosperity"" followed by some great Indian dance forms by the students and team of this organization having participants from both Indian as well Swiss society. After many classical dances there was also a much awaited ""Bollywood themed "" dances as well....the performers have done a great job with the last dance wherein they danced with lighted lamps in the hand.   
A very enjoyable evening indeed !!   
Wish you all a very Happy Diwali, 
Vik

			vevey pleased ?   
Tough forum ...    
			
			Amazing festival celebrating Canadian independent music. Simply wicked lineup including Broken Social Scene, Owen Pallett (formerly known as Final Fantasy), The Hidden Cameras, Do Make Say Think, The Acorn and others.   
Here's the lineup:    
Tickets are on sale now for 37 CHF for a single concert or 100 CHF for the entire thing ( )   
More details can be found on the somewhat difficult to navigate festival wesbite (just hold the mouse over the festival header to see your different options):    
Let me know if you are coming along for a night or two and we can meet up!
		 
			
			Saw The Acorn at the Great Escape in Brighton either last year or the year before, I forget. They were great, would be well up for a trip to see them in Switzerland   
Like the new BSS album too, will check and see if its a one nighter or make a weekend of it
		 
			
			I'm definitely going. Got B&B booked for two nights Friday and Saturday, ticket for the Friday (Broken Social Scene!) and will make a final decision on the Saturday regarding that night.   
Saw The Acorn a couple of years ago at an End Of The Road Xmas gig which headlined the much-missed Broken Family Band and also featured The Accidental. Darren Hayman and Jeremy Warmsley doing a set of covers of Magnetic Fields songs. One of the best gigs ever. And I've been to a LOT of gigs. A lot.   
If anyone has any bar / sights / comic shop / other recommendations then I'd be Vevey pleased to hear them   "	3	1	 Feb 2009	['11', '7']	Heartland Festival in Vevey - Nov 10-13	gking	32	1952	Concerts

			Ill be there mate! God knows how many times I've seen them now...   
			
			I didn't know they were playing ... 
But now I do, I might be there ...
		 
			
			Yeh I'm going too. been a while since i saw them last....Vfest i think....Burgess was totally out of it haha
		 
			
			Great - let`s meet up before, if anyone wants to. 
We`ll set it up nearer the date.   
			
			Saw them in Dublin about 5 years ago and was pretty impressed. Unfortunately i'll be away for this one, but have fun
		 
			
			i'll be there all going well - but you will find me sedately seated at the sides    
			
			Someone I know saw them at a classic sticky floor joint in the UK the other night...by all accounts they're on top form so should be a good gig    
			
			YAY!!!! Cant wait!       
			
			Can one get tickets on the door?
		 
			
			Not sure about that - sorry. 
Anyone fancy meeting up before?
		 
			
			I have heard less than 100 tickets were sold. I am sure you can get tickets on door or go to starticket and get print at home tickets
		 
			
			Sadly I have errands to do tonight.     
I am surprised that hardly any tickets have been sold.
		    me too, i am hoping it is a bad rumour   
Shame you can't make it
		 
			
			I guess that`s a No then . . . PM if anyone changes their mind, as I`m leaving work . . right now.
		    Dude, errands can be done tomorrow! How often do the Charlatans play in Zürich?
		 
			
			A tad of a pisser - but something else has come up ! 
I suppose I could always go to The Coral tomorrow .....
		 
			
			A great night and another reminder why I love the sedate swiss crowds, I was at the front most of the second part with a very large bump and not once was i knocked pushed or elbowed.    
Wasn't sure what to expect really last night, i am often left disappointed at some of my old favourite 90's bands but last night was a great night. Tim Burgess was buzzing on stage and seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself as much as the crowd   
What's with his hair though?       Totally agree with that! it was a great set - not as full as it deserved to be but then, as you said - Tim Burgess was on top form . . even with that hair .  
Actually it`s a good venue and the accoustics are excellent.

			I'm thinking of going to Pratteln the 8th of october to see Sabaton ( ), but I'm afraid I may be the only one in CH who even know of the band    
Anyone else thinking about going there?
		 
			
			I know of them, but don't like them sorry!   
I saw them at Z7 during a festival last year - not impressed with the vocals. But each to their own... I'll be visiting Z7 quite a few times this year, once their summer break is finished.
		 
			
			I would have totally gone to this but my holiday to Switzerland starts only in Dec. I'm going to go see Finntroll, Samael, Metsatöll and some other bands at Z7 on 12 December. Do you know of them?
		 
			
			Looks like Sabaton will be playing again next year at Z7 at their 3-day festival at the end of May.       
Not a very exciting lineup to date in my opinion, but plenty of time yet. Destruction are great though!   
I've seen Finntroll about 5 times and have several of their CDs. I think I'll be out of town when they come to Basel though. I'm looking forward to Therion and Rhapsody of Fire in the next few months. Somewhat lacking in good really heavy stuff though this year at Z7...

			Peter Mayer, singer, songwriter and lead guitarist for Jimmy Buffett, will be playing acoustic and solo at the EG Lounge of the Parterre/Kaserne, Monday 27 September.

			@Kaserne in Basel?  Are theer tickets?
		 
			
			No tickets -(but maybe we can take up a hat collection !) he's playing in the EG  bar/lounge of the Parterre (sorry , my mistake.  Not the Kaserne, but next it).  He will be there by himself, playing mostly his music, solo, on one of his acoustic guitars.  Come on by!

			Anyone interested in these drummers or with kids, I think there is a ""free"" demo in Basel this coming Saturday.           
EDIT: just watched that video again - just eff'ing awesome...
		 
			
			These guys are brilliant. Well worth watching even if you know nothing about drumming and have no kids!  
Thanks for the tip Carlos.
		     Saw these guys at the tattoo a few years ago - pretty dam good they were also in the Edinburgh Tattoo a few years ago.
		 
			
			Has anyone found out if it's free? I can't find any trace of it on the net apart from on the puppenhaus website (the link Carlos posted)...
		 
			
			From their Facebook Group:      I guees that 'performing in public' means free. Why couldn't it be the following weekend? I would love to see them perform.
		 
			
			Are you sure it's really the ""real"" Top Secret Drum Corps? I did wonder if it might just be a bunch of teddy bears dressed up as them..... (given the pictures on the doll house museum website and the lack of posting on the official Top Secret website......).   
Well, we will try and pop into town to find out anyway! If it's them then it would be awesome    
			
			Whoever can make it, go there. What they can do, is just amazing. If yo dont have any plans for the weekend yet, go there.   
I saw them 6-7 years ago at the Edinburgh Tattoo, and in my opinion, they delivered the best show.  
One of them dropped a drumstick, and the whole crowd was just ""Ow"", and everybody was curious, if he would just pick up the drumstick, or what would happen, but whoever dropped it, got a new drumstick out and continued playing, and it went so fast, nobody knew where it came from. I thought it was part of the show, but have not seen it on any video of them, so i think it was indeed unplanned.   
Doc.
		    Have look at the video above (from the show you say, I think). When they close-up to the drums, look to the right hand side of the drum and you'll see about 4-5 spare drum-sticks.   
Dropping drum sticks is definitely an occupational hazard for these boys, for which they have prepared       I did wonder as well, but it is coming up to the Basel Tattoo soon (hence, I guess, the display at the museum). Put it this way though, the implication to me is pretty strong that they are the real deal. I'll be pretty pissed if it is a ""fake"".   
Also of note, the Basel Tattoo performers will be parading through town on 24th July from 16:10, I believe (again I only saw this on a flyer at the tram stop). The route is roughly down Freiestrasse through marktplatz and on to clarastrasse/platz.   
Interestingly, it appears that Top Secret are not on this year's programme, so it suggests that the Puppenhausmuseum's claim that it is their only performance in Basel for the rest of 2010 may be true.
		    I saw the confirmation on their Official Fan Page on Facebook: Top Secret Drum Corps, so I guess it is actually them.  I did wonder about it being teddy bears, looking at the museum website.
		 
			
			Might as well put the  in here since someone else did all the work for me.
		       
I put the link in (twice in) the original post...
		 
			
			Sorry - I actually read that first post and saw the quotes but completely missed the two links. Shame upon me. 
Sorry Carlos. Actually, I think I was so keen to say how good they are that my typing fingers flew faster than my eyes looked.
		 
			
			There is still time to get down there to see them if you are in Basel.
		 
			
			I can report: it was live, it was free, it was top secret awesome    
			
			They were awesome.
		 
			
			Here is a bit of their performance in Interlaken last week       
			
			Thanks a lot for posting that. Hearing the rhythm again (we saw them in Basel last year) even tore Mr.L away from his computer to look over my shoulder at mine.
		 
			
			I went as well and waited for them in the boiling sun with my movenpick ice cream. It was a totally cool show! They did drop a few sticks. I filmed the whole second ""song"" (the whole thing was only about 15 minutes long). 
Thanks very much to the OP who made us aware of this free event (and great opportunity to visit Basel for the first time)!! 
Thanks!
		    I saw them in Edinburgh as well - I think it may have been the same year!!  They were the highlight for me and they are on my to-do list for once we get to Basel.  I'll keep an eye on their website.

			Hello! I would love to see this game and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions re getting tickets? Any experience with viagogo.ch? any ideas where I might find tickets without such a huge markup? Thanks in advance for any suggestions...   
			
			perhaps try ricardo.ch as the the date approaches......   
I assume you are paying to see Milano because that other franchise is a joke       LOL. probably they are just semi joke now with A'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''mare.   
OP: i found this:    
I picked barcelona-Lakers. Went to the online shop at opening and still teh best place i could buy tickets was the 10th row.
		     
Dude, I would love to come as well. Maybe you can set up an event.
		 
			
			thanks for the ideas... I will keep looking to see if I can find some that are not soooo expensive. Its for my sons bday present, a huge fan, so he doesn't really care if they are not so great this year!

			Hi, hoping someone can help. Looking to visit from the UK for the purple music night  which is held at the end of the month (Oct) at  Pelikanplatz, Zurich. If anyone can give me any feedback or advice, I'd be most grateful.  Also looking for a cheap hotel nearby for the Sat night.  Thanks

			Some decent acts at Rümlang in late August 
(Placebo, Maximo Park, Faithless, etc. etc...)           
Need to remove the umlaut to get the site to work           
Weird, I copy-pasted straight from starticket.ch and I have the page open right here with the umlaut in the address bar    
			
			Is this the first edition?    
If you are going what are you looking forward to see?
		 
			
			belle and sebastian and thats it.   
(groove armada, underworld n faithless would be cool, but...if you buy 2 days you can buy 3 and that would man i would waste too much money anyway...)
		    I would have just liked to go on the friday and the sunday but like you say it's the same price as the 3 days.
		 
			
			Probably the best line up of all the open-airs this year.  Gurten rocked, but this tops it mainly due to the fact that every night you've a top dance act too.   
GROOVE ARMADA 
FAITHLESS followed by UNDERWORLD 
PRODIGY!   
Chirpy music from Belle & Sebastian and Kate Nash and then Hole, Placebo, Maximo Park and the Stereophonics to Rock the joint!   
Big Scandinavian influence too, The Hives, Mando Diao, Soundtrack of our lives, Shout out louds, Jonsi.   
Respect to the organisers, put on a great product and I'd defo be going for the 3 days if i was here.  Funny, it0' one of the least known and as far as I know youngest of the Swiss Openair festivals.   
Awesome, bit gutted I'm flying to Thailand on Thursday (Not really but you know what I mean!)
		 
			
			I have 3 day tickets, couldn't resist.   
Quite looking forward to I am Kloot and of course Faithless....will be the 4th time I have seen them at an openair and they are always amazing.
		 
			
			A lot might think I am lucky but I have to look after the sound system and backline on the MTV stage..... it's gonna be a lot of work.... We start building it up on Wed. 
Still, hopefully 3 days of at least dry weather will be nice and if anyone has time to come and say hello I will try to be social if I have time...       Seems like there are a lot of Faithless fans on here. Strangely it's a band I've never really taken an interest in. Will try to check them out.   
I am looking forward to seeing Placebo (though I haven't listened to any of their recent stuff), the XX and of course The Prodigy.       How comes? Did you volunteer? 
Good luck with it       As an Album band they aren't all that much but live they are fantastic, best band I have seen at an openair.
		 
			
			I am going, but really only bought the tickets to see The XX, an awesome band that have been around the UK for over a year and still widely unkown, but guess this will change after they win the Mecury Music Prize this year. This is one of their very few concerts.   
I would definitely recommend checking them out on youtube.   
They are also followed by underworld, so looks to be a great Saturday night    
			
			Just doing the Fri and Sat.  Being out in Opfikon late on a Sunday night doesn't tickle my fancy.   
It's unfortunate that so many other street festivals, etc are the same weekend.  Why not spread the fun around.
		    Thanks.... no it is my job... I am forced to do it....  
I actually love my job, done it for 30 years already and I don't ever want to have to do another... even though the pay could be better...    
			
			i'm going on friday and saturday!    
going basically to see vive la fete! on friday (check them out if you realy want to have fun) and dEUS on saturday.  
also looking forward to placebo, the xx, and get well soon (i saw the latter one at for noise last weekend. very cool)
		    I have already seen dEUS (a long long time ago at Montreux) and thought they were good.   
Thanks for the tips will check out vive la fête! and get well soon.
		    you are welcome!  
i've seen dEUS too, love them!  
just a warning about vive la fete. don't go expecting deep, complicated music. it's music simply to hav fun and dance around like an idiot. which i plan to do!
		    Yes the band's name made me think of stereotypical popular french bands (with an accordion that play at ""bals populaires"") but checking out their music on Youtube they sound more like the belgian punk movement bands that were popular at the beginning of the 80s (like Elli et Jacno for example). I like their style...and the singer looks pretty hot too       haha, els is hot indeed!   i prefer the keyboarder, though!  
glad you seem to like them! let me know if you had fun!    
			
			Interesting news....maybe.... 
The MTV and Skyliner stages were stopped at the border and it took Swiss customs about 36 hours before they even let the stage material into Switzerland...  
The main stage crossed the border with similar paperwork 1 day earlier without any problem.... 
This means there is a lot of late shifts for the guys building the other 2 stages but it will still be ready on time...    
Good old Swiss customs officers..... maybe they couldn't get tickets...    
			
			Hope the stages have arrived

			Hey, anyone going on Satuerday that I can join?   I really like Deus, never saw them live. 
I am new in Switzerland, want to make GOOD friends!!
		 
			
			You will all be happy to know that all 3 stages are built and ready, tomorrow the rain starts and so it might be an idea to go with waterproof clothes or you're gonna get wet.  
The stages are fairly well built so there shouldn't be any technical problems because of water... fingers crossed....  
The MTV stage sound system is kicking so at least you will be able to hear what you want to even though the Zuri sound limitations are a little less than they could be. 
I hope everyone that goes enjoys it...  
Scream ""Dave"" at me on the MTV stage if you have the time and I will try to be social if I have the time....even though there is not that much chance of that....       I am going on Saturday. PM me and you can come with us. It'll be fun    
			
			the Organisation is really crap, first people waited around 4 hours for exchange  
the tickets against wristbands(because the office opened late and you have to take the same way you got in), there are  no signs at the offices, no signs to the concert area(wich is a 10 min walk from the tramstop and the boxoffice) and the concert area is full of mud..........., there is a lack of toiletts... 
I can't recommend going there in these conditions except you like as it is......
		 
			
			The organisation was terrible and the 1st band, Local Natives on our stage only got to play half of their set. 
There weren't enough security people to cover things properly and the mud is nothing to do with the organisation, that is to do with the weather and there isn't a lot anyone can do about that. 
I have seen a lot more mud than that (knee deep) at very well organised festivals. 
Sat...today, should be better organised and better weather. 
Headline is Underworld on the MTV stage.... I hope you all enjoy the sound, the system is running well, even though some of the sound engineers from the bands could have been a little better....  
Groove Armada and Vive La Fête were good...    
			
			Just got back home about half an hour ago!! Very muddy and very wet!! But had a fantastic time nevertheless... Yes organisation could have been better as some of the stuff is just common sense...     
Anyway bring your wellies and a change of clothes [store in the lockers in the HB if u want to plan ahead]   
Vive la fete, The Hives, Groove Armada (my favourites) and Placebo were Awesome... The electro band from Germany after Placebo were quite funky too but I had enough by then!!   
Looking forward to the next two days!!
		 
			
			I'm looking forward to the music but I am not really looking forward to the hours.... I did 14 hours Wed.... 16 Thurs....16 yesterday... will do about 18 today and then about 26 tomorrow-Mon because we are taking it all down after the show tomorrow..., more than most do in 2 weeks...    
			
			As others have said, the mud last night was pretty bad and it will be terrible today, Wellingtons will be non-optional. 
Don't drink too much because there aren't enough toilets and to be honest they could have done with putting some (a lot) more  duck boarding down.   
If the tram is full you can also take the S-bahn to Glattbrugg, the walk isn't that much further.   
Did anyone else try the weird ""cider"" they were selling called Somersby? Sugar rush!!!!!   
Enjoyed Hole, long time crush on Courtney Love represent.
		    I agree with that. I walked all the way to the concert area with my printed ticket so had to walk all the way back to get a wristband. IMO they should either have clear signs up or someone filtering along the way to make sure that only people with wristbands get beyond a certain point.      I went purposely early so as to be able to see the Local Natives. But how could people see them if they were made to start at 15.55 and the wristband distribution only started at 16.10?    
Positive is that the stages seem well positioned. So there isn't too much pushing when moving from one stage to the other.
		 
			
			COURTNEY LOVE ROCKED !!!   
Yep bring the gumboots for sure. We took a tent just to put our change of clothes in. Surprisingly we didn't have to pay extra for the camping ticket... 
Also I managed to take in a CAMELBACK full of vodka, energy drink and fruit juice. I do that at every festival I go to as I hate lining up for drinks and not to mention paying through the nose for them. 
As said before walking to the train station at the end was the better option as a pose to taking the tram. 
All in all, I have been to some of the biggest festivals going and have been festivaling since 1996 Big Day Out... 
I have never seen such a terribly organised festival. It seems to me that the organisers didn't bother to go to a festival before organising one of their own. 
I'm not going to get into it because for me the bands are the drawcard. It's an awesome lineup when you consider how cheap the tickets are and that its right at our doorstep. It's so awesome to be able to come home afterwards instead of having to camp... 
Hats off to the Sweeds, there are a mass of top Sweedish bands with Mondo Diao topping the list tonight. Check em out, they're great... 
So take your gumboots a change of clothes and your party attitude and you'll have a ball....   
ROCKONSWITZERLAND !!!
		 
			
			Mud mud mud mud mud.... today was better for the weather and good bands being topped with the Underworld show, very good. 
The weather is supposed to be even better later which will mean the mud will get stickier but again some amazing bands. 
Hope the brave ones are enjoying it as much as I am working on it  
Off to bed I have to start work again in 4 hours....    
			
			Off back to work again... Enjoy todays bands and the mud... 
Prodigy should be very good, looking forward to hearing them..    
			
			What is the stuff the bloke dressed as a sheep at the bonesdocktor stall is selling? 
It steams and is yellow, I am guessing it isn't wee.   
Faithless were brilliant as always but I lost interest in I am Kloot, not the right music for me (in the state I was in) at that time. 
The XX were pretty good but I really like Mandu Diao, brilliant. Never heard of them before.
		 
			
			i'm back!    
all in all i had a great time!  
hole was fun but i was not too impressed. vive la fete rocked (but they always do. also special kudos to the security guy who was having so much fun during the gig!). too bad it was raining. by the time i got from the mtv stage to the covered vip area i was totally soaked. my hair was a mess but my makeup stayed in place, thank you MAC! saw placebo from the above mentioned covered area, quite enjoed them.    
saturday was a bit different, as we had no vip treatment anymore, which means not nice, clean toilets (seriously, these were awsome) and no cover! but thankfully it did not rain.    
get well soon were very good  but walking around the sticky mud started getting on my nerves.so i shallowed my fashion pride,  went to town and bought myself the (allegedly) last pair of wellies available in all the dosenbach shops in town, plus a pullover (plus some other things but these were not festival essential!). went back to festival to see dEUS which were BRILLIANT. seriously, if you don't know them check them out. like, NOW.    
we left after the gig because i could not stand the thought of having to go to these toilets (is it really allowed to have such a small number of toilets in a festival?!). so i sacrifised my desire to see i am kloot or the xx (who were playing the same time, so that saved me having to decide which one to see) and went out in zuerich instead.
		 
			
			4th time I saw dEUS and I was not disappointed. I guess the smaller crowd and stage inspired them to do a quite convincing set. Speaking of the stage, funny to see an ""old school"" festival these days: free mingling of people in front of the stages, mud everywhere, barely any merchandising and a small camping site right next to the festival site. Felt 15 again.. 
Meanwhile my prayers go to the girl on high heels that I saw entering yesterday evening.    
			
			I hate to be reduced to the vocabulary of a 12 year old Jonas Brothers' fan but :      
Belle & Sebastian <3 <3 <3   
no better band to improve one's mood
		 
			
			AHHHH. home again and now dry.... 
I enjoyed today, some good music and even a bit of sun  
I didn't enjoy tonight... taking it all down again, started to rain not long after we started and got heavier as we worked turning into pi$$ing it down by the time we had to load the trucks, I got soaked... the things some people do so that others can see a good band... I must be crazy  
I found Saybia and Kate Nash good even though Kate Nash's sound engineers were less than average... Stereophonics weren't as good as I expected. 
I think the highlight of the whole thing (for me) was Deus or Underworld.... I didn't get to see much of the main stage bands because of changeovers on ours.  
Hope you all enjoyed the MTV stage... makes my job worth doing.....almost..    
			
			I'm kinda glad now that I didn't go.  
I really wanted to go, especially on Sunday, but muddy ground, rain and lack of toilettes are things that seriously annoy me  
Hope I have my chance to see Belle and Sebastian some other time...
		    Thanks for helping to make it happen.   
Do you have any insider info about the bands? Who were the most bitchy? Who were the nicest?       Don't want do give you any regrets but the mud wasn't as bad on the sunday (than on the 2 other days). Also I didn't have a problem with the toilet situation but then I'm a guy.
		 
			
			I had a weekend pass and exercised my rights to miss the issues with the queue for the bands and actually I found there were loads of toilets in between the MTV and main stages....I didnt have to queue once.   
I liked the XX a lot and was the only reason I went, enjoyed Faithless too, and Underworld was good if a bit too long.   
But......my complaint,  (though i should know better after many concerts here in Switzerland )where was the crowd and atmosphere -  Seems the swiss are people that feel concerts and festivals are purely a specator sport - ok not all people dance, but a bit of expression of hand clapping or arms in the air when the bright lights for the band always feels good.   
We didn't let it get us down though and made a party of our own.
		    I understand what you mean: During the Prodigy set I was stuck behind 4 swiss guys who hardly ever moved. Everyone around them was dancing and jumping about but they just stood there. What made it worse was that they didn't even clap between the songs. When one of them got his mobile out and started checking his messages I couldn't stand it anymore and pushed in front of them.    
I suppose I should mind my own business and let people ""enjoy"" the concerts in their own way but IMO it spoils the whole atmosphere.
		 
			
			I do apologise to all for my white-man dancing, but it was tough in the mud to move my feet.   
I think the best part of the weekend was on Saturday running around town trying to find wellies.  Merchants were very confused as to why everyone was, and there was some 'friendly' competition between concert-goers to get the very limited supply of boots in the men's 43-45 range.   
Maximo Part is one of the worst band's I ever ever seen, talent wise and musically.  Luckily they were followed by a wonderful Swiss band, The Bianca Story, on the no-name stage that kicked in the fun.   
Lots of other good bands too.   
Courtney as vile, personality and music wise, as always.  Worst cover of Jeremy ever.
		 
			
			The festival was amazing!   I had loads of fun, and it seems I missed out on the worst night for rain! However I did miss Placebo, so that stinks. I am on limited time constraints, because my baby was at home, but the husband was sweet enough to let me go, and he stayed. So I went purely for the atmosphere, seeing friends, and my fave bands of the line up, Mando Diao, Faithless, the XX, Underworld, but I missed them because my husband called me with issues   But I had such fun. Sunday was okay, but really went to see Belle and Sebastian, and friends, and of course Prodigy. But left again early, wasn't feeling the vibe. Maybe because I passed on the hand rolled cigarette..   For all of those complaining about the mud... give me a break! I had a blast, and thought it added to the atmosphere. As for lack of Bathrooms, well it is to be expected, I didn't think it was all that bad. If you were afraid to wade through the mud the lines were shorter on those stalls   But I did agree it was worse on Sunday when the mud was sticky, only because it made dancing that much harder!   I sure hope they do the same sort of thing next year and in the same place, since it is like 5 minutes away for me!!    
			
			Yeah, if you're complaning about mud and shortage of toilets at an outdoor music festival, you've become too Swiss.  No, I take that back, as the Swiss seemed to enjoy it too.   
The only problem for me was location, as I could see my office building from the site.       I don't take much notice of the bands themselves since I am only concerned with the technical side. 
I get to meet many but only to say hi. 
The Prodigy refused to play at the planned time because they had quite a lot of lighting/LED effects in their show and so wanted it to be dark when they played..... Stereophonics made a big fuss about having their showtime changed by 30mins early in the day but ended up having to accept it. 
Kate Nash's band were a bit stuck up, the rest were generally very friendly and civil. 
The most relaxed were probably Saybia, they were just there for a laugh and enjoyed themselves a lot. 
The most professional were Underworld (both band and crew), also very friendly.   
As for the crowd... Friday saw the most dancing and party, Sat. and Sun. they weren't very lively at all other than for maybe Deus & Underworld, but I think the weather put the dampers on a lot of people.
		 
			
			The best bands played on friday, especially the Hives........ 
None of the other bands comes close to them(I think). 
They are one of  the best live bands of the world. 
Saw them last year at the alte boerse (only 450 people got in), 
can't be better then that Day(only Rise against or Green Day are better Live 
Bands at present).
		    I suppose that Vive la Fête contributed to the friday atmosphere.    
Just curious: What was the policy regarding ""encores""? Could every band have one if the audience were keen? Or were some not allowed because of time constraints? I was a bit miffed to see The Prodigy not get an encore (and am wondering if it is because of the audience or the late start).
		 
			
			for anyone interested...my boyfriend uploaded maquillage by vive la fete on youtube. enjoy!           Just a pity that all their songs sound the same, though (and that they were wearing ridiculous clothes)    
Erm I think saying a band is the ""best in the world"" is bound to be a bit relative and based on personal taste...More than on reality.   
TBH I saw the start of their set and wasn't really impressed so left so as not to get soaked. I'd say that Vive la Fête, The Prodigy, Mando Diao (and even maybe Placebo) were easily as good.
		    Wow so much energy, so much style and so much grace...and I'm only talking about the security guy       or maybe the fact that 1996 was fourteen years ago, and to say that the Hives are anywhere near as good a band as Belle & Sebastian..   
			
			Great weekend, went for the dance/electronic acts more than anything, treated it like 3 club nights out. Didn't see many of the daytime acts, but as others mentioned all the big name evening acts were fantastic, especially Underworld and The Prodigy - Maxim was on top form.   
Also the closing acts on Fri night/Sat morn - Booka Shade and the Crystal Fighters were very good, shame most people had disappeared by the CFs and it was lacking any atmosphere.      Completely agree, there lots of people hear the front just standing around with earplugs in. If you want to just stand and watch and are worried about the loudness get to the back!  
I hate pushing through crowds as I know how annoying it is for others, but for The Prodigy I had to head in for some action too!      That was a great call by them, as soon as we pitched up for them we were saying its a shame it's not dark. That needed to be in the dark for full effect.
		         
Probably why my husband let me go instead of him       We have fairly strict level limits in CH, it isn't allowed to be more than 100db anywhere where the public can hear the sound. Those levels are measured in ""category A"" which means the group of frequencies that can damage peoples ears.... mid and high range frequencies. 
The level has to average max.100db over 1 hour (there are of course peaks and dips) At the MTV stage we measured 100db exactly anywhere people could stand from the front barrier to about 10m behind the mixing desk when testing, meaning the sound level was extremely even. 
I guess the Swiss are known for their complaints about noise.... 
I sometimes get annoyed when I see adults with children at concerts and they don't give the children earplugs, but wearing earplugs doesn't reduce the sound level evenly and so adults miss out on the full acoustic experience of a gig.   
The policy on encores was... the bands had a certain set time, varying from 45mins to 1hr 20, that is their set time, if they wanted to play an encore it had to be included in that time. 
The last bands were allowed to play a little longer when there was no other band following on another stage, Underworld played about 15mins longer than planned. 
The Prodigy could have been 1 of those bands that play their set and take the money, I am not sure in this case whether the decision came from the band/management or from the stage management.
		    HAHAHAHA   
I do have to say that concert goers over the age of about 12 with earplugs do annoy me very much... but they will probably get the last laugh when I am deaf at 60.   But who had more fun?!    
			
			Got to admit that I do usually wear earplugs.  
When I was younger I didn't care about it at all but now that I understand how the ears work  (and how easy it is to lose hearing) I do.   
I can assure you that wearing earplugs doesn't affect my capacity to move or clap in any way.   
I am sure that S00ty_0 is very competent at what he does but you just need to have one incompetent sound engineer (or one that doesn't give a f..) and you've damaged your ears permanently.
		    The line-up for the whole weekend was worthy of Glastonbury and a crowd of 150,000 people, so getting to see that lot, in rain or sun, for less than 20,000 people is something very, very special indeed. Unfortunately, most people here are so used to having a totally saturated festival, concert and club scene across the country that, IMO, they don't appreciate where the culture stemmed from in the first place (particularly festival culture) and hence, don't know HOW to enjoy it properly. It's a big generalisation of course, as there are many exceptions and some of the younger, more open-minded and internationally oriented Swiss have the brain to look outside their own back yard to experience another angle elsewhere and bring something of that back home to try and kick against the blandness of the status quo here, but the majority are just too comfortable/ignorant to bother most likely and just accept that they come here as a matter of course.   
From the bands' point of view, they are paid anything from 20-30% more than their normal fee to appear in CH generally and it's not a destination at the top of any bands' list with regard to furthering their careers, but such financial inducements mean that Switzerland does get to see an inordinate number of top flight acts all year through plus the fact that geographically it's in the centre of europe and can often be an easy stop-gap gig to earn a bit more money on tour when going from Italy to Germany or some such. In my experience, not many bands jump for joy when they know they are going to be performing with a ridiculous 100db limit to an audience that rarely gets out of the starting block when it comes to going a bit mad and having a good time. Some bands refuse to play here point blank, no matter how much money they are offered.
		    Totally agreed, to have such an awesome lineup in your backyard with so few people was just fantastic. We could comfortably walk up towards the front with just a slurred 'Entschuldigung' and without the vengeful elbow in the ribs that can follow at the much larger festivals.  
Asides from the organisation ups, which I'm guessing will be made right next year, that was a kick ass festival. Solid lineup and to be honest the mud and rain didn't really bother me.... Just adds to that unique experience.   
Rock Werchter Festival in Belgium in July we had 41 degrees on the Friday.... It was stinkin hot !!!   
Which would you prefer ???
		    its interesting as i remember that a guy wearing a PearlJam shirt at one of her gigs got kicked out?! anyway...tagesanzeiger wrote an review which said nuff: sh.i.te.
		    Oh, come off it.  
It was a line up that might have filled up the Saturday night slots on about 1, maybe 2 stages at Glasto before the evenings main big guns slot. 
Also, the headliners were all rather has been/festival circuit old schoolers: 
Groove Armada, Placebo, Hole,  Prodigy, Faithless, Underworld, etc - (Sterobloodyphonics?? ) 
Not saying they're not good, but ZH open air is just another stop on a non stop summer european festival trawl for most of them.   
Glad you enjoyed it & all, but lets not get carried away, eh?    
			
			UW were just sooooo nice. 
Last 3 days i'm really enjoing the last single:          Sorry, each to there own, I know, & I   Underworld, but I find it's quite depressing to think that's the same force that produced Cowgirl, Dirty Epic, Pearl's Girl & Born Slippy etc.          It's a little bit different when comparing a festival with 45 stages and 177,500 capacity over 4 days that's sold out and one that's only got 3 stages and 20,000 capacity per day that didn't get anywhere near that. The point here is that even at this year's Glastonbury you'd never have be able to see any of them in such small crowds, and even seasoned (meaning good?) festival acts still get to play   The ratio of act to maximum attendance works-out pretty keen I'd say, I can't remember the last time I watched Underworld, or indeed most of the main acts, perform at any festival with less than 10,000 people in front of them......that's very, very special in my book       Have to say I tend to agree with you on this. Their new direction seems to be pitched at trying to be relevant to the younger crowd who were probably only just born when they first stepped-out on a festival stage. Perhaps it's a strategic effort to get the old material another hearing by hooking them with something of the more lightweight pop-oriented dance stuff of today?
		    Totally agree the quality of the lineup was undeniable. Not only the acts on the main stage but also on the other stages. Top notch open air.
		    I follow UW since the very beginning and i'm happy they still progress and continue in their work. As i'm also a fan of dnb, especially all the Hospital Records stuff, the combination Underworld + High Contrast just suits me precisely. But agree - it's not dark and long anymore.
		    Decent openair, but for me top notch is the likes of Primavera (best in the world) Leeds & Reading,lollapalooza, Glastonbury etc
		    +1 for that. Huge fan of all things Hospital and loving the HC UW collaboration, as well as all of their older work. The new Underworld album will have lot of other collaborations including another track with HC. Looking forward to it.   
mirko - I only found out on Sat day that London Elek and MC Wrec were playing in Bern that evening. If you ever hear of any others over here give me a heads up, I'll always be up for checking it out.

			Ok, little too last minute, but there will be a yodel gig tomorrow, 6am, yes - you are reading it correctly, it is 6am, at Bains des Pacquis. I'll be there, it is free and part of the whole Aug 1st! If anyone is interested, we could have breakfast somewhere. Bring coats, it might be chilly still.        
			
			6am! Very brave of you! I'm no way near there, but just seeing this reminds me of a local yodel gig I witnessed on a regular basis... A liitle old lady with a walking frame used to yodel her way round the local Coop... It was probably her best bet for a bigger audience and she performed free too!
		 
			
			Yodeling has a campy reputation but watching a small group of skilled yodelers give me goose bumps everytime! I remember being in a little mountain pub 5am on a Sunday during carnival when 2 ancient looking farmers and a young chap around 20 broke into the most beautiful song... too bad I'll miss the Geneva gig  .
		 
			
			Cmon, I need a body guard, be a sport..   
Here is a vid I like..would be good with some heavy guitars, I think.        
			
			Do you have any idea what time will finish and if it will be like the video you posted or more similar to this:       
Im tempted but im working tomorrow..
		 
			
			I have no idea what it will be like, 6am these days is very nice, though, so even if they are corny and ott I will probably still really like the expedition. I should pack the Appenzeller with me, shouldn't I  so it's perfect... 
I didn't find the time they end, either..
		 
			
			And?  
How was it?  
...
		 
			
			Fabulous! It was cool...I think around 400 people came, some people straight from parties, hangovered, there was a group of surfers with families waiting for the sun to warm up, many older folks, mainly, it was great, toddlers dancing. The ladies voices were strong and the guys' gentle, quite spiritual..   
We all yodeled, after a crash course   I didn't know yodeling is actually quite easy, well, years of symphony choir training didn't hurt, haha...The older folks sitting around me were giving me bewildered teary looks, looking at me as the long lost yodel farmer swiss kid, hahahaaa...I had a blast, I miss choir singing. I should join them, if only for the costumes, wows, the lady with the punk handkerchify think sticking out of her head, too cool..   
Thanks, gata, these gigs are every sunday 6am, they have a wonderful breakfast food there, too..
		 
			
			I like it. MusicChick walks into an SVP type gathering and takes a couple of yodels.   Great stuff
		    I doubt the yodeler just to the right of the ladies is in the SVP  .
		 
			
			It was not political, that was nice..They had an Indian man (I think) rippin' out some great tenor yodel tunes, yay.    
Now, why is the spellcheck giving me yodeling/yodeled-correct and yodelling/yodelled as incorrect?

			One of the very best... Seen him in Melbourne and Hobart and each time he was superb...     Wow what a gig yesterday. Xavier Rudd was good as always but Ben Howard was amazing!!! I was expecting less from the pre-band but wow did he give Xavier a run for his money. Amazing acoustic set. Kinda reminded me of John Butler trio at times. I was suprised how many people turned up fort he gig, you could hardly move. Didnt know he was that well known in Switzerland.   
			
			I have to agree, the show was AWESOME!  And Ben Howard WAS amazing!!!  It was the best live show I have been to in a long time and the best X-Rudd show I have seen since the very first, very intimate time I saw him before he was famous.  Fortunately I was upstairs in a great spot to watch the show (so I didn't have to deal with the packed crowd down below).  He is so talented and Izintaba is such a great addition to his sound.  :]

			Hi all,   
Thought I would feedback about a recommended artist as I found the original link to the Zurich music scene here in the first place    
I went to see a lady called Lesley Meguid play a set at La Catrina last week, and she was brilliant! She's half American, half Swiss, sings in English and if you like live acoustic sets you should give her a look. She plays there again tomorrow (20/07/2010), see link below. You can probably find her on Myspace too if you wanted to hear her style of music before committing       "	0	1	 Jan 2010	['37', '13']	Highly recommended live gig in Zurich - and it's free!

			Anyone planning on going this year?   
I went for the forst time last year to see Prince. The whole event was fantastic so I am heading back this year.   
I'm waiting for the full line-up to be released. Hopefully there will be some good arrivals.   
I know Stevie Wonder is going to Locarno to do a show so I wonder if he'll be at the Jazz Festival? I would love to see him.   
I'm off to the Moon and Stars concert in Locarno but two weeks after him       
			
			i am definitely going. love the festival- love the free shows and all the fun along the lake!
		 
			
			Yeah. They will announce the full line-up on 
the 29th. But I wonder if it's any fun going alone 
to a big event like this (I don't know anyone in 
Switzerland who digs this type of thing).
		 
			
			I'm planning to attend the festival from Thursday, June 8 - Sunday, June 11th. Can anyone recommend a modern, stylish hotel nearby for us to stay in the vicinity? Thanks!
		       
Theres a few.
		 
			
			nah lived in Montreux and went everyday, but not to the concerts....to pricey for what it is....good atmosphere tho.    
Btw calculate +30 min just to get into Montreux , and dont count on parking if you are going by car.    
Other Hotels: 
Swiss Majestic should be finished by then (renovated)***** 
Hotel Helvetia *** Very nice though , on festival 
Hotel tralala *** trendy and nice, 5 min walk 
Royal Plaza as said before 
Pension Willhem , littlew run down hotel but a bit cheaper , 2 min walk.    
Theres tons of other hotels but zou need to book now cause soon all will be full
		    I hope he is. I'm gutted that i'm not in the uk to see him at Glastonbury, but if he's here I'm there! (he's amazing live)
		    If you go then, you should have plenty of choice of hotels.  The festival doesn't start until 2nd         Yeah right   
			
			Overpriced and definitely passed it's day. the free shows last year were lame. New Orleans has a real Jazz fest
		    Maybe but we are a bit far from New Orleans.   
I thoroughly enjoyed last year. It is what you make it.   
It may be past its day for you but not countless others. I can't wait to head back.
		 
			
			this years line up isn't bad at all. erykah badu, massive attack, pheonix, gil scott heron and i can't remember who else. but it's pretty good.
		    Are these names 'strong rumours'?  The official line up isn't announced until 29th April (Thursday)
		 
			
			Great list...many thanks! Another friend suggested this very stylish hotel in Lausanne:  .
		 
			
			Programme is out       
			
			Of that list, I'd be up for   
3 July - Willie Mason / Norah Jones (anyone who doesn't know Willie Mason, go listen to Oxygen on youtube) 
7 July - Regina Spektor / Ben Harper 
8 July - Massive Attack   
Possibly also interested in Sophie Hunger, Cocorosie, Roxy Music - already seen Air once this year though...   
Doesn't look like a *great* lineup to me...
		 
			
			Love the lineup but we decided we can't pass up the opportunity to rent out our flat at Le National de Montreux.   
So we're going off on holiday this year. Last year we enjoyed the free stuff, the food stands, and the Jazz Train.
		 
			
			worst program ever.
		 
			
			Could interest some of you guys and girls: 
James Taylor Quartet is playing      
			
			Phil Collins will open the Montreux Jazz Festival this year:       
The whole program available on the website:       Well it is sort of as it includes this pony..   
Phil Collins 
Simply Red 
Katie Melua   
..but then it redeems itself with these   
Air 
Massive Attack 
Gil Scott-Heron 
Erykah Badu 
De la Soul 
Herbie Hancock 
Quincy Jones 
Nas & Damian Marley   
(all imho of course)
		 
			
			well, i did bite the bullet and get tix for de la soul just to go see something one night - and I don't even really like hip-hop that much. imho ""worst program ever"" because of the lack of rock. in past years, i've seen some incredible rock bands such as jeff beck, neil young, black crowes, santana, king crimson, etc. this year the closest rock act is what, billy idol? ben harper?    
MJF has become too expensive and too elitist in recent years, which is why they are favoring older bands, less rock, and more repeats. too bad because it used to be a pretty exciting and diverse event.
		 
			
			Think I might go see phoenix, but 75CHF! ouch.   
Supported by Solange la Frange too, who range from awsome to so so, seems to depend on the venue.  Fantastic in a small club, don't know about a big stage.
		    Was there a shift in the time/space continuum overnight and Montreaux woke up back in 1985?   
How many lame-ass has-beens can you fit in one ""Jazz Festival""?  Phil Collins, Simply Red and Billy Idol? I can only assume Huey Lewis is too busy having his prostate checked to make it for this years brilliant line-up.     
Hope the organisers have tripled checked that all defibrillators are in working order.     I do have a thing for Bryan Ferry though       this is the problem. if they were 30 or 40chf shows, i'd go to a bunch. but for 75 or 90chfs, considering i'd also have to bring my wife or find a friend to go with, puts up a high barrier to entry.       ha. i heard 'more than this' on the radio a week ago and it's still echoing around. must've been that bill murray karaoke scene in that movie...the name escapes me now. i've loved 'avalon' since i was a kid but i'm afraid i would fall asleep at their concert.   
p.s. i did see billy idol back in his heyday - and i think it was 1985!  
(they filmed the mony mony video at the concert i saw which was kinda cool)
		    I think The Hooters are yet to be officially added to the line-up, they are in the area as a back-up.       
			
			I agree with others that the line up is nothing special this year.   
I notice that the Mark Knopfler gig is already sold out, and with tickets up to CHF220!
		 
			
			A bit of promotion, but I'm sure its relevant:    
Swiss-American-Egyptian Lesley Meguid is playing on one of the smaller stages at Montreux Jazz (July 4th ""Under the Stars"" stage, exact time TBA)   
You can also see her next week at her album release concert at the Abart club in Zurich               
Matt
		 
			
			fyi got this email last night...          Doh! Only just saw the line up and now Willy Mason and Norah Jones are sold out...feck! Anyone got any spares??    
The Dead Weather also play on 3rd, tickets go on sale today, which might be worth a watch.   
Vampire Weekend anyone...never seems them live, and not too keen on their second album but...anyone interested in going?
		 
			
			Nothing really takes my fancy this year so I'll be hitting the bars instead
		 
			
			For those seeking a jazz festival that hasn't sold its soul to the devil and his pocketbook, check out Cully Jazz Festival, usually end of March first weeks of April.   
Still small, a much more interesting mix of musicians/groups, excellent vibe and not the big machine.  Some big jazz monsters, along with up and comers.  And perhaps the most beautiful spot on Lake Geneva, deep in the heart of Lavaux and its sweeping south facing wine terraces.
		 
			
			No one has mentioned that decent tickets for Elvis Costello cost CHF 260. That is nothing short of highway robbery!   
			
			One of the problems the festival faces is that its two halls are, by modern standards, very small and the top bands dont reduce their prices because of this.      The festival certainly doesnt make large profits and often makes a loss. See this.   
			
			would it be appropriate to bring a 10 and 13 year old to the festival?
		 
			
			Its allowed       .   But, unless they are particularly tall, they probably wont see much in the standing area !   
			
			Had to laugh when i saw the concert prices insanely expensive, went every year between 1996-2005 but now forget it, also the lineup is pretty dull
		 
			
			another lineup add...       
			
			I thought this event was only for millionaires.   
Would love to go, but we're not rich
		    Yeah it's no problem.   
Last year they had some PS3 Guitar Hero competions in one of the Bars. Loads of kids there winning PS3's etc.
		 
			
			Well, looks like I'm going to see Phoenix at any rate, are they any cheap places to stay?  or are there places open all night?
		    Splendid hotel and Eden Palace are good and cheap.                You could try the   very close to the Casino.
		    Great line up!
		 
			
			Anyone I want to see is insanely expensive   I thought Montreux was supposed to be a jazz festival - since when have hip hop and rock been jazz? Think it needs to change its name if there are only a handful of jazz artists
		 
			
			Found it's really quite in this thread, anyone heading there tonight?
		 
			
			thanks heaven the swiss boonies i live in are at least pretty close to montreux... so i'm going almost every weekend despite the price which is upsetting anyway
		 
			
			Went last night and had a fantastic time. Loads of free shows on, so need to break the bank by going to see one of the big stars. Atmosphere was great around the concert hall area.   
Cheers

			i'm half sick that the opening band for roxy music cancelled and now   is playing. it's sold out so i'm going to miss him!    
and how the hell did i not notice paco de lucia is playing? also sold out.    
			
			have to say a bit disappointed in the De La Soul concert. i didnt appreciate the fact that they added a 2nd opening act to the lineup a month or two later after i bought tickets. Instead of opening earlier, they just pushed the main act out later which sucks for those who are taking the train. it was either leave early to catch the 1:08 back to lausanne, or wait until 2:28.    
we didn't even see the opening act 'The Crib'. Tech N9ne was super cool but there was no band, just him and another rapper rapping over prerecorded music. The sound was great for that (I got to try out my new 340CHF earplugs). But for De La Soul, the sound SUCKED. Maybe it was comparing the prerecorded set vs the live music but it was way too loud, even with my earplugs in that shave off 9dbs of loudness. I ended up putting in the crappy foam plugs they give away for free, then retreated to the lounge to watch on the screen and sit in comfort.    
I think I'm going to write Claude an email or maybe just link him to this post.   "	49		 Jun 0001	[]	2010 Montreux Jazz Festival	guest		5739	Concerts

			Hi Folks,   
The ""Mozart of Madras"" would be in town! His ""Jai Ho"" concert would take place on   at  . A. R. Rehman is a prolific figure in Indian music (which subsumes Bollywood ""filmy"" music). He won Oscar in 2009 for his music in the international hit movie ""Slumdog Millionaire"". The Jai Ho concert has already kicked off from US and he would be covering a lot of central Europe too. More info here:    
I met him through a press conference in Hotel Part Hyatt few weeks back. Being President of Indian Student Association Zurich I was part of the group which met him through a video conference (He was in New York and us in Zurich). And I have to say he is such a wonderful and humble person in real life, no airs even after achieving so much. He dodged some of the obvious questions like ""How do you feel after winning Oscar"" with charm and also told us he would not be limited to music from his movies.    
I have adored his work since childhood, his earlier works like Roja and Dil se are ethereal! I am too excited to be in the audience. Hope you guys would also come to enjoy his music!
		 
			
			For tickets you can also contact Ms. Dipti Abhilash (0764662902)
		 
			
			If I am not wrong, he won the prestigious Grammy too for the same. Wonderful event. I would look forward to attend the show to have a different taste of music.

			My name is Brandy. Some of you may know may because I used to run the Zuerich Open Mic.    
On August 25th, I will be premiering my new program with my band Chamber Soul in the Kaufleuten's summer sound series. We, chamber soul, are a trio composed of voice, trombone and guitar. The idea is to take a classical chamber approach to modern pop/soul music.    
In our new program we have invited the world famous string arranger Larry Gold to write arrangements of our songs. Larry is the man behind not only the ""Philadelphia Soul sound"", but has written string arrangements for everyone from Justin Timberlake, to Kanye West, to Al Green.   
The amazing local Galatea quartet will be joining us to play these arrangements.   
Chamber Soul puts on a great show, and have been written as "" a great band that presents a magical concert evening that feels more like dinner with great company.""     
Check us out at Chambersoul.ch   
Id love to see you all there!

			The Sweet did a concert in Ludwigshafen last year.  I could hear them from my office window (it was just across the road).  They were quite entertaining.
		     
I think I'll offer my services as a native guide.   
I could even work as an interpreter for Slade...

And don't expect to see Noddy Holder or Jim Lea there either!       Just Dougal then?

		    Alice?  Who the...  Oh.  Alice.  I know her.  Used to live next door.       
One of Smokie really did live on the same street as me in Bradford.   
When Bradford City were in Premier League, we saw Smokie in the stand once - all wearing Smokie T-shirts.

			It is fun. We went last year and it turned our to be well worth the effort. (One of my favourite bands, The Kings of Leon were playing so I am a little biased)   
 Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

			I went (For the second time), great little festival but I won't be going again! For the two headline acts, The Strokes and Kasabian, they dropped the volume to about half of what it had been during the day. We were about 50 metres from the stage and we could talk to each other without raising our voices. Totally ruined what should have been two mind blowing acts. Real real shame, which was second only to the disappointment of watching England get a thrashing from the Germans on the last day of the festival!

			Hi!   
Anybody from Zürich going to see Stevie Wonder on next Wednesday? 
I don't want to stay there over night so i was wondering if someone would like a company and could give me a lift. 
The tickets are still available for 115CHF.   
Thanks!

			At Stevie Wonders last concert in North Korea the crowd were so ecstatic thay began to shout out asking for requests.    
 It just so happend that Kim Jong-il (a massive Stevie Wonder fan BTW) was in the crowd. Excited and overjoyed he shouts out ""Do ah jazz chord""    
 So Stevie, amazed at the leaders request, plays a ten minute solo on the keyboard and the crowd goes wild.   
Kim Jong-il, now looking a little confused shouts out again ""no, no do ah jazz chord!"" Stevie, loving the enthusiasm of Kim Jong-il, decides to oblidge and plays yet another jazzy number. once complete, again Kim Jong-il, now a looking a little angry, shouts out AGAIN ""NO, No, No do a jazz chord! damit""- tired of this Stevie says ""Look man, how about you come up here and do it yourself if you're not happy!""    
 Kim Jong-il jumps on the stage, grabs the mike from Stevie and begins to sing ""ah jazz chord, to say, I love you""...

			It's just been announced that  .   
Anyone on the forum likely to be going?   
If my hair is only 2cm now, how long is it likely to be by next June if I don't have it cut?   
Does anyone know where I can buy a thrash metal t-shirt in Zurich  ?   
Will I still look good in denim at the age of 40?   
Should I just stay at home with a Bing Crosby CD?
		 
			
			That is going to be one heck of an amazing memories tour. Ah, but if they'd only done that tour back in 85, I'd have been happy    
I'll be in the UK by then, but the venue they're playing at there I'm told is terrible. Ah well, I'll still probably go, too many memories attached to all of those bands!
		    I feel the same. It's not going to be anything like it would have been, and I'll probably not enjoy it as much as I would have then, but it would be a shame to miss it.   
I'll just know that I'm in Switzerland when I'm offered ear plugs at the entrance. Knebworth, for all its faults, is, at least, in a proper Heavy Metal country.    
			
			Bookable starting at 21.12.2009 08:00 oclock          It's likely I will be. I doubt my SO will come. I took her to her first Rock concert this year. It was Heaven and Hell. I told her she had to wear black, which she eventually did after a couple of outfit changes under protest. She radiated self-consciousness on the bus ride to the Volkshaus.   
I wonder what are the chances Lemmy will expire on stage like Tommy Cooper?      If it's receding at anything like the rate of mine, the average length will still be 2cm by then.      I think you're fishing for compliments now.      Depends on what you are planning to do to/ with it.      In the three years or so I've been in Zürich all the bands I've seen have been going for more than 30 years I think. And I haven't been to any classical performances.      I usually pocket a handful for use on a long distance flight.
		    Perhaps you'll find something  .
		 
			
			That could be worth making a trip over for.
		    Heh, but if I manage to get to that show, my earplugs will be in my pocket! Lemmy and Co. made sure of that back in 1984...
		 
			
			Do you think a darkie would be welcome?    
They aren't so welcoming at the metal bar on Langstr.   
I'll join in if others are going.  DB, you confirmed?
		    I'm not confirmed, and won't be until the 30th at the earliest, but I'll let you know if and when I book.
		 
			
			Thanks for the heads-up. I'll know to avoid said venue on that particular night    
			
			I wonder what the order will be on stage.  I remember when metallica, anthrax, megadeth and someone else I forget now were due to tour in the 80's and the only real success were Anthrax because they went on anywhere whereas the others kept squabbling over who was the ""headline"" act.   
I wonder if metallica will do the proper stuff and now there new soft rubbish.
		    I'm   the order for the big four would be Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Megadeth - but I'm betting that they'd do a switch around for every gig, as each is huge in their own right. Will be interesting, with the Mustaine/Metallica dynamic to see how long this tour even lasts. Everything I've read over the past years says he's as bitter now as he was in the 80s.
		 
			
			That's really sad news! Are those bands still able to speed? 
I thought Metallica deployed their last album in '89, wasn't it? 
The bell tolled for them 20 years ago, same for Megadeth, Motorhead and so forth. By the way, honour to all the great stuff they did 20 years ago.   
Cheers 
Nick
		    Heh, to me Metallica released their last good album in 1983.
		    I'd argue against your vision, given that you missed, at least, Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets.
		    Sorry, DB, I don't think that what doesn't work at 39 will improve with another year of aging ...
		    Judging on the layout of the poster, Metallica appear to be the headline act. For me, Heaven & Hell and Motorhead are probably more of an attraction, but that is probably my age. I am surprised that it has been described as 'The big four' and not 'The Big Six'. Perhaps that may cause confusion with Judge Dread    
			
			Ok, I will undust my leather jacket and start growing my hair. It should be long enough before Juny.
		    I quite intentionally missed those. When Ride came out, I felt they sold out.       Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax and Metallica are known as the big four of thrash.              
			
			I go to a lot of metal every year, usually including a couple of three-day festivals, but I doubt I'll make it to this one.   
Firstly, it clashes with Hellfest in France -   - this is a great festival. Well, at least it was in 2008 when I went. I'll likely go in 2010 too, as the lineup looks amazing.   
As for the others, I haven't seen Metallica for about 17 years and I'd be curious to see them, despite not really liking them much since I heard the drum sound at the beginning of ...And Justice For All. Never liked Megadeth. I stumble across Heaven & Hell and Motorhead frequently at big festivals. Slayer have become boring live, unfortunately. Anthrax - always the lightest of the ""big 4"" and I always preferred S.O.D.!   
So, anyway, there's my analysis. Great that they're bringing such high-profile bands to CH though.
		    Good taste    
Quite a few good bands at Hellfest, although it is odd to see bands like Kiss and Twisted Sister along with 7 Seconds and Agnostic Front and Immortal on the same bill!
		 
			
			I'm in! Still got a few vintage shirts at home... Slayer, Motorhead and Anthrax.. but no, Anthrax is way too small now for me. So.. Slayer & Motörhead it is.. which one you chose DB ? Last time I've seen Motörhead was 4 years ago or so... and Lemmy was still great.                 ---> zürich hb to Wil. 30 min train ride, then from there shuttle busses! Enjoy!
		 
			
			cheers man thnx
		 
			
			YES!!!  This will be a AWESOME since I am going to miss them playing in my hometown Chicago in Feb as I am moving to CH in January.   
Ed
		 
			
			I'm going just to see Slayer! I hope I don't break myself trying to do the same crap I did back when I was in my teens. Moshing like a maniac to ""Mandatory Suicide"" just doesn't feel like something my body wants to jump into nowadays...      Haha, no worries, there's not likely going to be a very violent mosh at the Slayer concert, it's mostly HC Punk these days that has the brutal moshes.         
Hahahaha notice the guy in red near the front who does a very strange dance by himself..  I don't know why but watched it twice and laughed both times.   
Ed
		 
			
			Following the death of Ronnie James Dio, Heaven & Hell have pulled out of their tour including this event.       
			
			This is a very interesting line up, besides the 4 main ones, Alice in Chains, Mastodon, Volbeat and Unearth is what I am currently listening    
Is there anyone still attending?
		 
			
			i can't find an updated program (running order).  anyone got a link?    
i might possibly go on friday pending the schedule.
		 
			
			I won't be there. I'd only be disappointed.   
I'd prefer to leave the past in the past.    
			
			i feel the same way about the main four but alice in chains and mastodon are really worth seeing. both of their latest albums are incredible.    
but holy crap - is this a camping only festival? ticketcorner only lists the full pass which is 129chfs.
		    Click on 'Running Order' in the link on my previous post       i'm not that dim...      ...which is why i asked.    
i thought maybe it was an oversight on the web site. seems odd to be getting so close to a festival and still not know who is playing when.
		 
			
			Well that the issue of a band and venue for the wedding solved ...
		 
			
			I have a ticket going for 90 chuffs if anyone is interested.. (wife doesn't want to join.. )
		 
			
			well now that mastodon has cancelled, there goes half my reason to see the show.       Come on Hash surely weve grown past this. 
Metallica THE metal band and their followers (including me) surely aren't like this. 
Bleeding me 
Tim
		 
			
			i have seen metallica in caracas some weeks ago.... i guess what!!!!.... i'm going to zurich just the same day the will be playing at sonisphere festival !!!!!...   
James, Lars... please play two days after!!!
		 
			
			I have seen Metallica the last time 2006 in Durban and the first time 1984 as Support Act of Venom at Zurich Volkshaus. That show changed everything and it must have been hard for Venom playing after them.
		 
			
			Last saw Metallica Monsters of Rock Donnington 1990 or 91, was a bit hazy in those days, ACDC headlined and Metallica kicked arse then. Also had Motley Crue on aswell with Queensrych. What a jumbled line up. Belter of a day though. Would'nt mind seeing them again but doubt the neck would be able to take the banging!!   
Just found an old Slayer album, South of Heaven- kids dont like it       Definitely. Reminds me of the US 1985 Combat tour with Exodus, Slayer and Venom. Venom gave a truly half hearted show throughout the entire tour, and even the video produced from the tour used a promo stage footage for their songs.    
I remember the Venom guys standing at a backstage door looking out and watching Slayer, it was kind of heartbreaking to see. Sad, because Venom were an excellent band in their own right, just different from the new thrashers coming out.
		    You are Venezuelan? LOL me too, I think we are the only two forum members from Venezuela    
			
			Just saw a video that Scott Ian posted from the Zurich gig:        
Looks like a great time, a great gig...did anyone here actually go, and how was it?
		 
			
			I was there on Friday - I went late though as was in the process of moving.. I parked a tad away and while walking to the arena was amused by the number of people walking out with mud up to their knees.. They must be the people who jump in the mud and catfight or something like that... within 10 minutes.. I had joined the army and was wading in at least 30 inches of mud walking (at least 1km) to the stage.. My wife's comments were too vulgar to post here..    
After 200mtrs I was left barefoot as my shoes insisted on producing too much suction force.. so I just walked out of them   
Nontheless, this was a tiny price to pay compared to listening to master of puppets live.. I can still hear it echo in my head..   
			
			Mud, Music and Metalheads    
been there done that! 
i loved it despite the weather and the gigantic mudhole!   
anyone going to see Slayer in Zurich in August??!
		    I saw Slayer hundreds of times, these guys rock despite their age... I don't mean they're old but for playing brutal and fast metal, they're still doing it like hell ! Do you have their latest album ? I don't really like it. There's nothing new at all    
I'm more of a Metalcore fan. Hatebreed being my favorite band, I also a huge fan of Stick to your gun. I went to As I lay dying gig in Soleure a few weeks ago. This is something you must see on stage !   
HORNS UP !     
			
			@BUGFROMHELL 
no i dont have their latest album, but a live performance is a live performance so i will be getting my ticket today  
if anyone is going get in touch and we can meet there  
i will check out hatebreed/stick 
cheers

Will sell them for 70 CHF each - which is 15 CHF cheaper than current prices.

Thanks,

			Long shot, but as a congolese soukous fan with withdrawal symptoms.... can anyone suggest where I should search to try and find some (live?) congolese music in the Zurich area?
		    There is no soukous in Canton Congo.   
But...yesterday Lisanga played at some ""Caritas""-Festival in Lucerne. Seems that the band is Lucerne based.    
Chiga-Chiga are based in Switzerland but there are no concerts announced so far.        
			
			Many thanks, Prof!!

			Can't help you with Congolese music but how about something from Mali? Mix in some Yodeling and Trachten and it sounds like good fun.          "	3	0	 Jun 2010	['1', '1']	congolese music in Zurich?	Dr Alex	12	1129	Concerts

			Hi all - is there a good website to keep ahead of who is touring and where?? Had a good website for uK gigs, but am searching cold here...
		 
			
			Not sure how good it is, but   lists concerts that it sells tickets for (which seems to be most big ones).
		 
			
			Thanks - also the concerts section in this forum is not bad too!!

			I noticed today on Marina & The Diamonds website that there are still a few tickets available. Well worth a look in my opinion. I have to wait until October to see them in the UK.   
Their album was released in Germany & Austria today and is already No. 5 on iTunes.

			Hey all 
I am moving to Zurich with my BF sometime b/t Sept and Nov. I LOVE live music and was wondering what the music scene is like in Zurich. I've been spoiled living in Raleigh NC currently and growing up in NYC - I like classic rock, love the Grateful Dead, bluegrass, Americana, some jazz (just getting into that)- am afraid I'll go thru music withdrawal in CH. Looking forward to a new adventure and making new friends.   
Cheers, 
Sue
		 
			
			Well, it ain't New York but if you keep an eye on the concerts calendar here you'll be ok. Most of the interesting shows aren't advertised until tickets are gone - a weird local quirk - but there's a healthy scene and you'll see great acts in tiny venues. Plenty from here are regular concert goers, so you'll be sure to meet sympathetic folks soon.
		 
			
			Are you more into big gigs or local bands ? There are plenty of places, many non-commercial that give local bands a platform to play. If you want you can go to such gigs pretty much any day of the week in Zürich. As for big bands, it's festival season in Switzerland, so you should be doing fine in summer at least. But there's a lack of real live-music pubs and clubs* in Zürich which aren't concerts.    
*1 or more house bands, or a guy in the corner, 2-3 days per week at least.
		 
			
			Do they have Country Music? (not Bluegrass, that's an entirely different animal.) I'm talkin' I just lost my truck, my job, my dog Earl and ""now I'm a gettin' drunk and crying in my beer"" country? That would be nice. If there are any venues anyone knows about, I arrive in August and would like to go. (Zurich area) thanks, M
		    There is an annual Coutry festival in Albisgütli, which attracts both local bands and big names. I'm not sure when it is though. In between times there's not much going on in the way of country music as far as I'm aware although there are several number of local bands who play it. Maybe if you ask around a bit you can find out where and when they play.
		    There's not much Nashville country in Zurich but surprisingly a fair amount out in the sticks, which is kinda appropriate. As for Bluegrass and it's grandson Americana, there's a fair number of world names passing through each year and most get such good receptions they regularly return.   
There's a very kindly lady at the Migros City ticket counter - who doesn't speak much English - who'll let you know about upcoming events not yet on the radar and reserve tickets once they're in. One good reason to learn some basic German.
		    The festival was a few months back if I'm not mistaken.  That and Willie Nelson is all I've seen advertised around ZH sadly.

			Just seen an ad for this today, the support act is Editors - quality    
			
			Have seen them in Geneva - they're excellent live, very recommendable.
		 
			
			one of the best live acts ever, but the new record is shi.te plus i hate stadium gigs...and if you have seen them on showbiz promo 200peeps club gig... the purist in me is left cold... have fun!!!    
			
			Hey, I'm selling 2 discounted (10%) tickets for the concert of Muse ... tickets are seated. If you are interested please PM me!! Soon!!
		 
			
			Discounted to 10%, or by 10%    
Have decided I'll probably take a hotel in Bern overnight and head back the morning after.
		    2 seated tickets Kat. 2 paid 260.20 CHF ... sell them at 230.00 CHF ... bit more than 10% of discount   .. if u r interested just PM me ... tickets are still available.
		 
			
			Anyone interesed in sharing the trip to Bern to see Muse 2.6.10. Have car and muse on the ipod. I will be leaving from Lenzburg or I could drag myself to Baden if necessary Pm me   
			
			Will be taking the train over, and last train back - left it far too late for the hotel idea to work.....   
Supported by Editors, in case I hadn't already said so, who are also bloody brilliant live    
			
			Anyone got any spare tickets to sell? standing preferably...
		 
			
			Also looking for 1 or 2 tickets for a couple of friends.  I'm sorted myself, and have one spare for my mate who's looking for a second.  I also have another mate who's looking for one.  PM me please if anyone has 1 or 2    
Terry, give me a shout over the weekend as I'll be heading down before lunch and know Bern pretty well if you wanna look around a bit.
		    standing tickets still available - bought mine yesterday!
		 
			
			Just a thought and still not sure of my travel plans yet but if anyone is interested maybe we could organise to meet up at HB and travel down to Bern as a group.   
At the moment I anticipate leaving HB around 3 -4pm but I do need to confirm train times and exactly which train we'll be taking with a couple of other people.
		 
			
			Sounds like a plan Jemma - and cheers for the ticket!  Beer coming your way    
Was planning on travelling back to ZH after if I can make the train - anyone else?  Gig starts at 6pm so I think there shouldn't be any problem getting back.
		    Intercity trains from Bern to Zurich are every half hour and the last train leaves at midnight according to SBB so getting back shouldn't be an issue. This is Switzerland and due to the noise regulations concerts aren't allowed to finish too late    
Does anyone know if there are extra trains being put on? At the moment I'm thinking of upgrading my GA to 1st class as reckon the trains home will be packed       Linky  - google translate had an interesting version, so if anyone can translate that'd be super!   
1st class...genius    
			
			One seated ticket for muse, now going for 100 chuffs.... Any one interested ?
		 
			
			there is a special train at 16:40 from the HB direct to Wankdorf.   
the SBB website seems to suggest that this train does not have class specific carriages     
no special trains listed on the way back to Z-town though.   
upgrading your GA for the homeward journey is likely a good idea (and probably only 10 chfs extra)             
			
			Any idea if that one stops at Lenzburg, I havent had any nibbles on my offer of a lift down so I am considering the train option.
		 
			
			nope, the train from Zurich is direct now stops.   
that said i just checked   and there are Sbahns from Lenzburg to Zofingen, with special trains from Zofingen to Wankdorf.             
			
			70 chuffs for a return ticket   Maybe I be driving after all. Anyone need a lift ?
		 
			
			If anyone is going tonight and is in the Zurich Altstetten area and happy to sell my 2 spare tickets then I'll split the takings with you!  
Please PM me.    
Thanks.

			Chinese pianist, Lang Lang will be performing in Zurich this Sunday, 7th Feb. Tickets are almost all sold out -  repeat performances in Bern and Geneva on 12th and 14th Feb respectively.   
He might not be everyone's cuppa tea but I personally cant wait!    
Anyone going?    
			
			Why not announce it on the  ?    
			
			Didnt realise there's one. Always thought it was under the events calender    
EDIT: managed to set it up now. Any chance of helping me merge UM?    
			
			Can you indicate a website ?   
I'm extremely interested.
		    You can get the tickets on ticketcorner.ch   
Very limited seats left though.....hurry!           Just bought two       Seeing as this thread covers Bern and Geneva as well, it may as well stay active in case those Members from other areas are interested in attending. May I suggest to them that they, too, add it to the above linked calendar?    
I hope to make the Zurich show.
		 
			
			Ouch those tickets prices are steep. I missed him in Dublin before I left about 3 years ago. Only then, the sold out tickets were 20 a pop. I think I'm going to have to pass on seeing him this time around :-(
		    Done and done    
Just checked the tickets for the rest of the cities and are almost all sold out - in case anyone's interested. Best to hurry and get them.       Thats what I thought too, but I've never ever seen him perform 'live'. Will be great to do so, his theatrical and exaggerated mannerisms are legendary - though thats not the reason why I am going!   Couldnt bring myself to pay for the Kat 1 tickets though....ouch ouch ouch.
		 
			
			Zurichers, tonight's the night! Woot!    
			
			Bloody amazing night!    
Those in Bern and Geneva who have tickets, you're in for a treat.

			Just wondering if any know of any of the more alternative pubs, clubs and venues in Zurich, Bern and Basel?   
Places like rote fabrik and the like.
		 
			
			in Zurich   
try profitref, its alternative, depending on the day you can find dub/reggae and very good techno, minimal and deep house...ppl are very relaxed..   
there is also another place, close to Langstrasse, its a house, next to a ""not alternative"" disco/pub named blin (or something like that) good music, alternative venue definetely..
		 
			
			Maybe I'm a bit of a noob on the topic.   
But does Alternative refer to the Alternative Rock music scene,   
or Alternative lifestyles etc.?
		    I'm thinking mostly of alternative music, just not limited to alternative rock.
		 
			
			El Lokal is mainstream alternative.    
That heavy metal bar on Langstr, would that be considered alternative.  Have been meaning to go in there despite my yuppy attire.
		    Although I'm not really looking at rock bars, stick em on the thread, I don't mind a bit of punk.
		    I think you meant 'Bling' and the bar nearby is the Mars Bar, which has regular live music. To complete the Triumverate, the Tessiner Keller opposite the Mars Bar is the best 'alternative' place for food in the area.   
The Stray Cat bar at the end is good for bad boys.
		 
			
			Cyrus, help us out. What kind of music do you like? What might be my alternative  could be your mainstream.
		    I did that the other week, wearing yuppy clothing, and the looks me and a friend got were basically along the lines of ""You are not one of us, get the f**k out of here now""... borderline hostile. Never again.    
The place looked like a true hardcore metallers place though, i've never seen anything like it. There were no casually dressed people there at all.
		    Must give it a look then    
			
			I love alternative bars too.   
But when I use the word, I refer to the mid 90s onward sound.    
The 'newer' alternative groups have great and really cool music and all, but it's all the lame hipster fans I can't stand. How did the 'alternative' crowd become the social snobs?!?!   
""It's not the band I hate, it's their fans""--Sloan
		    Now I definitely want to go.  Furthering on this and Chemmie's point, snobbiness can ironically be found in the cliques that were initially a rebellion against it.   
In my personal case, my dress style has no correlation to my musical tastes, so I'm used to getting stared at or told off at places.   
Think I'll organise a weekend drinks night at the Heavy Metal Bar.       I was trying to keep the thread general, and not just related to me.   
I'm looking mostly for the places that play alternatives to house, top40, and school/wedding discos that seems to be the standard fair for big clubs and venues.  If the venue puts on a wide range of nights, so much the better.  Personally I'm looking more for the alternatives to the big dance clubs, so electro, techno, minimal, dub, dubstep, beats, nudisco, and a whole lot of stuff I don't know how to classify.   Also, smaller venues who might be interested in letting me DJ.
		 
			
			In Zurich:   
- Helsinki (right behind Banhof Hardbrucke) 
- Bombay (near Langstrasse)    
They're both great!
		 
			
			In Basel, the  . Often punk, but lots of other stuff, too. And a nice bar/restaurant upstairs.
		 
			
			I went to that rock bar on Langstr.   with a friend who fits the part. I had people blatantly tell me that the girls there arn;t interested to talk to me because I was wearing a red T shirt ... haha Narrow minded people ... on the plus side, it was an interesting experience and I was even invited to the other lesser known metal head bar around the corner, the cactus which was kinda a cute looking american biker bar full of yet more metal heads.    
Worth a look but maybe the sort of place to grab a quick beer whilst parsing by rather than spending your whole evening there. Although there was a crazy lady swinging flaming ball and chains about on the  , that was pretty entertaining   I heard a rumor that it will be closing down at the end of this year, it seems that the locals do there drinking at home and just go there for the music and to abuse anyone daft enough to enter without the appropriate attire. haha
		    I was in there a few years ago. Cracked me up to watch people headbanging while listening to a DJ.
		 
			
			Hmm Pirates in Hinwil is pretty good apparently, i used to live in hinwil but never went. You take the s9 straight through to hinwil from zuri which will take about 40 mins or you can take the more regular s5 to uster and then change and get s9 from uster to Hinwil.   
Uster also has some cool bars, theres the Red Ocre which is an Aussie bar. hmm what else, I Love OXA but thats not really alternative but im sure if you go into the niederdöfli theres a tonne of nice bars and some clubs down there. Thats where i spent most of my time on exchange year, either that or by the lake drinking. even in winter, like a bum. lol
		    Ah, The Cactus.  One of our favourite places.  Very friendly place with hard rock (not heavy metal).  They also have the tree trunk in the corner where people take turns trying to hammer a nail in (with the pointy end).   
Classic joint.  Straight out of a small town in Canada or the US.
		    Check out (as you probably know) Tillate and Usgang for what's going on. Um, there is new club, Ill see if I can get you info (a friend works there) and I think it might be what you are looking for (you might be able to play too).    
The reason I asked to be more specific was to find out what you meant by alternative- it can have different meanings (well at least to  me)  as I previously mentioned and deffo is different to what Chemmie wrote.
		 
			
			I suggest dressing up black coat and going to X-tra ti Gothic party  DDD
		 
			
			It depends what you mean by alternative.   
One kind of alternative:   at   last night. Excellent quirky music, nice venue . . . small and intimate.   
An alternative alternative:  , the squat. Everything from punk to hardcore to metal to industrial to the arty end of electronica. Catch it before it's redeveloped as flats (by these chaps,  http://www.dasdreieck.ch/)      Bugger, wanted to go see that, but forgot, I kind of like her album, I wondered what they'd be like live      I've heard of this but never been.
		    I wasn't convinced by some of the Youtube performances I'd seen, but it was a really good live show.  The stage in Zukunft creates a nice space, you're close to the performers and you think you're witnessing something special.  Micachu herself has a strange but charismatic presence and the performance really got the crowd going.  My only complaint?  It was a slightly short set.
		      Hi Cyrus,   
Helsinki Sunday night band Trio from Hell are playing at the Stand up Comedy on Friday.   
But it looks like everyone predictibly equates alternative to some type of rock despite your above points of reference.    
I think for a different scene you'd need to check out another dirtier less sanitised city. I went to a Drum n Bass night up in Basel last month and chatted to a few local people there. One of them told me there's regular dub events up there, I'll contact the guy I met to find out more and PM you. 
Or Berne perhaps.    
But Moods has some interesting gigs on occasionally, but not a regular night obviously and DJing would already be arranged for the big gigs, saw US3 a few weeks ago.   
Matahari was a bit indie / rock commented on by Depeche from the first weekend drinks.   
Acupulco is a little bit experimental sometimes.   
Music at IQ bar at Escher Wyss Platz is varied but has no DJ.   
Last time I was at Babalubar the guy behind the bar was playing some cool tracks and was really helpful and enthusiastic when I asked him what the tune was that was playing. I reckon you could ask in there if they'd be interested in a one off trial DJing.   Worth a try.   
Finally you've got the ski season coming up and those snowboarders certainly know how to Dub.   
Keep us all posted if you find somewhere to DJ, sounds interesting.   
Cheers, 
HB
		    Bar 59 in Luzern recently let me play in their bar, and that went down well, they said they might have some more nights for me.  This is what got me thinking about expanding a little.   
BTW in Luzern, some places to check out.   
Bar 59 have a great variety of nights, a good crowd and quite captivating interior.   
Schuur put on some good gigs and nights too, though sometimes the crowd seems a little young.  International and local bands/DJs.   
Metzergerhalle on baselstrasse is good place for punk, rock and other metal things.  They also occasionaly have bands, mostly local, the ones I've seen there have been really good.  The place is tiny so you get right up close.   
Sedel is a bit far out of town, but it's pretty much the centre of the alternative music scene.  It used to be a prison and the cells have been converted into practice rooms for local bands.  Also a very good variety of nights.   
Treibhouse is supposedly good too, but I hardly ever go there, it's mostly for students and they make me feel old.   
Magdis, or st Magdalene is a great place, but not so much music orientated.
		    ""Coooooool"" (said in Bart Simpson voice).
		 
			
			The Sedel is also an artists collective. It has a very, very interesting history. They released a book with their anniversary a few years back, giving the history. Unfortunately, it is in German, but it was very interesting.    
My favorite part are the cows next to the car park.
		    Hi Cyrus,   
I sent you a PM of the info from my dub (& DnB) contact in Basel but thought I'd post this night that's coming up in Berne on Friday.   
Sounds like Berne is jumpin'.   
DnB may not be your cup of tea but   is on and a plethora of other non Swiss DJs (not that Swiss are inferior but it shows the scale of the festival's line up).

			Krypta Bar in Basel....       
			
			ok, im not linking to programmes or websites, too much work as i wrote sh!tloads of pages in here already about club scene in ZH. 
when i say electro i mean that as a general term that includes techno, minimal, house, electro etc. check websites, check myspace of them artists n get an idea whats up.   
indie means mostly indie-djays or_live that they have live gigs on. 
also check programme on websites of particular club.   
some of them might dont have a website...keep yo ear to the ground n watch for most modest flyers: black_n_white copies sticked with glue. 
the glossier the poster is, the more stiff, commercial and unbearable the crowd, club, music will be there to be found. its a simple measure that will never change n indicates where to go (except mascotte, but karaoke from hell and some live-gigs are ok)   
bar=bar with low-fi crowd in terms of less people in banking leisure wear, blackberry overkill, maserati car keys on tables, escorte service chicks at hand. etc. about 99,9% ""you are not supposed to meet your boss""-certificate

		    To those interested, I'm at   on the 30th of this month (Jan), I'm in the bar and playing all night.  The club is putting on a night called ""Märchen Grotesk"", from what I can tell is's a mix of thrash, electro, gothic and new wave.   
I won't be going quite so hard (unless I feel the night's heading that way) with my own mix of alternative and electro pop, hip hop and some leftfield dance.   
I hear the grotesk nights are quite something, entry to the bar is free, but there's normally a charge to get to the club next door, usually around 10-20CHF.
		 
			
			Hi-haha...I think you mite like to come to a party my friends are making for the 29thjan,my g firend is the feature dj and theres loads of fun to be had by all-sorry,not going to be a rock and roll revival nite-not that thats not going on somewhere else on the same evening,and also fun,i think-hehe 
so,the address is culb revier,hohlstrasse 18,8004 zurich.live techno,porn tech and wicked dj line up.  
come-its fun for everyone!      did you ask for a Pimms and lemonade?       I'm intrigued, what exactly is porn tech?
		 
			
			Even though Ive probably been listening to it for years already, what the **** is Porn tech?   
Interesting thread. Anyone know of bars/clubs that play alternative music (ie not top40 Beyonce crap) in  ?
		    This place is great, never had problems chatting to people there even when wearing normal clothes
		    Alte Metzgete can vary rather from night to night.
		 
			
			Hello there,    
I'm pretty new here and it's the first time i'm posting. I recently moved to basel and i really miss the indie music scene of london and nyc, clubs and live shows. any advice on where to go? anybody I could join (none of the people i met here seem interested)? I realized that Editors played in Zurich the day after their gig and I am still bummed..   
Thanks!   
Ali
		    Darn it, I am away this weekend Cyrus. I hope it goes well (sounds like good sounds to me) so that you get to do it again. This'll be your 2nd time at Bar 59, so it appears you're going down well.  
I will defo make the trip next time you're on. Any follow up sets planned yet?   
Cheers, 
HB
		 
			
			Alter Metz is really cool. But mostly for metal people. Kontik, next to Mc Donalds at Niederdorf is also a bar full o headbangers but more alternative.   
Does anybody wants to have a beer at alter metz? Send me a msg
		    Cheers, will let you know, think it went down alright but it was a bit quieter this time round.  Going to follow up with 59 shortly, also another booker was interested and took my details.
		 
			
			I wrote about it on the Zürich clubs thread, but the After Hours party at Stairs on Sundays is definitely one of my most alternative experiences here.
		    I have been to Pirate bar, and I must admit that after living 10 years in Switzerland this is the best place in terms of ""good mood"" I have ever been.  I highly recommend it.
		     
Back again at Bar 59 on Friday the 4th June (next week) with a mix of indie, beats, indie hip hop, non commercial house, tech and dubstep and other stuff.

			Has anyone seen the very convincing Jimi Hendrix impersonator in Zürich?   
He often performs by the lake at Bellevue (Zürich), it has to be the best busking act I have ever seen anywhere in the world. He looks and sounds like Hendrix. It sends tingles down the spine.   
Here is a link I found on Youtube.       
You can see him perform at the moment.
		 
			
			saw him the other day on the lake..he was even playing guitar with his tongue for a while..cool guy with a nice band

			Not to be missed.   
I was devastated when they cancelled last-minute in Nov 2008 due to tiff with the singer.  Who care's about the singer; it's all about the drum and bass.   
Seen them twice back home; both legendary shows.

			Hi Hash,   
I just try to get my lot together. Will leave work at around 4.30PM and meet some of the people at Zurich Mainstation around 5.30PM.    
I will be at the Station by 5.15, at the ""Treffpunkt"". At least all my guest speak better english than I do...

			Most expensive concert ticket I have ever purchased.  Plus a cc charge.  And then even a charge to pick them up!  Only in CH.   
But it's for a good charity.  Looking forward to the Beethoven.
		 
			
			Come on guys, I know there are lots of classical music lovers around on EF. Even though if its not your usual cup of tea, its a great time to be introduced. Like Hash said, its for a good cause with the creme de la creme of Europe's musicians as well as one of the best pianists living today!    
Program for the evening:   , Coriolan Ouvertüre in c-Moll, op. 62   , Piano Concerto Nr. 23 in A-Dur, KV 488   , 7. Sinfonie in A-Dur, op. 92
		 
			
			One should add the KKL concert hall is acoustically and architecturally a wonder.
		 
			
			Sorry folks, if it isn't Polish progressive rock I'm staying put
		     
			
			Less than a month to go now, but tickets are almost all sold out.    
If you havent got them, best to do so pronto! A great opportunity to see one of the world's more reculsive but uber talented pianists in action. No I am not an official concerts organiser    
			
			The KKL acoustics is a miracle indeed (for me it is above any other concert hall that I have been to).  
Eventhough spending a fortune for the tickets, do not try to save on good food that day (if you are among the lucky ones whose stomack is a socially active entity) - it doesn't matter if you are on stage or off stage - even the slightest pianissimo you produce is well heard.  
Enjoy!
		 
			
			I am ridiculously excited!    
The wait is finally over this evening! Anyone else heading down there tonight besides Hash and me?

			Everyone, I was at Long'i'rock at the weekend and it was awesome (even though I was there for only one day...). Very muddy, but well organised and the bands that I saw were excellent.    
Wrote a mini review here:

			friday night was incredible. one of the best live shows i've ever seen.   
if any band owned the festival...it was DOWN!                
since you missed it here's a sample...       
			
			Well written review but you looked over the only decent band there...

			Hello,   
Like countless others on this forum I am in Switzerland (Zurich) for the sake of a partner, and have limited German language skills thus far and am finding employment a bit of a problem.   
In the UK I was a professional music journalist, so I thought I would utilise my background here and set up a site/blog devoted to flagging gigs and concerts in Switzerland that might pass under the radar of some of the English-speaking community. Some very interesting stuff happens, often in smaller venues, and it seemed worthwhile to have a place for previews and details in English - hopefully not treading on the toes of the excellent gigs heads-up thread on this forum.   
The site can be found here:    
Hopefully soon I will upgrade to its own domain name and make it a 'proper' site.   
Thanks for your time, and if anyone is interested in writing for the site, do use the contact page or PM me here - particularly want write-ups/reviews of any gigs people go to.
		 
			
			I think it is a great idea! Nicely organised. Just thought I'd let you know you have a tiny spelling mistake - It is Aarau. Could you please elaborate on what you'd like people to write about besides concert reviews? Do you pay? Good job! Hope it takes off for you.    
			
			Ah thanks for the edit.   
At the moment the priority is 200-300-word live reviews of any rock/pop/jazz gigs in Switzerland that are well written and interesting. Otherwise, previews similar to those already up there need writing on a regular basis too.   
And the site is totally an amateur exercise for me at the moment, but in an ideal world that will one day not be the case...
		 
			
			Nice Blog!   
A source of Switzerland's 'underground' music can be found via Radio stations here. I'm impressed with the coverage unknown outfits get here considering the size of the country & this coverage inevitably leads to packed gigs in small local venues (which I like), bear in mind also that some of the types of Artist Groups are full of creativity like Bands playing Drum & Bass/Techno style music live, Swiss Reggae Artists (Famara - Basel) & experimental electronic music.   
Did you know? There are at least 73 important Radio stations here....
		 
			
			The site looks great. Hope it all goes well! Will definetely be using it.   
Who did you write for in the UK?
		 
			
			Thanks Nick and Transition.   
I was the editor of a small music rag in London for a while, also done stuff for Stool Pigeon, Record Collector, Quietus, Art Rocker, Rock N Reel and others.
		    Reggae and D&B . . . The cutting edge . . .    
			
			What an awesome idea! Great blog, two thumbs up from me    
			
			Have bookmarked this blog! Keep it up!
		 
			
			Thanks for the words of encouragement, hopefully it will be useful to y'all.
		 
			
			Hello Everyone,   
This week we can offer new previews of Nebula in Winterthur, Emily Jane White in Geneva and Berne, Beach House in Zurich and a review of the Wolfmother show in Zurich's Volkshaus last week.

			Hey, I really dig the idea and the blog, and I'm now subscribed.  I'd also be interested in doing some writing.   
Out of curiosity, did you take the name of the blog from the Bright Eyes song?  Because that is a great song.
		 
			
			Nice blog! FYI, Under Byen (from DK) is playing in Bern 18.02.10.
		 
			
			Hello everyone,   
This week on LandLockedBlues we can offer previews of the much-anticipated show from Yeasayer in Zurich on 12 March, and Danish weirdos Oh No Ono's show in Lausanne.   
We still have the TANTALISING, no less, free download of High Places' 'On Giving Up'. High Places come to CH in April.   
We also have a word from some pals at Radio LoRa who run a radio show called the Late Greats.    
You can all join in,   
LandLockedBlues
		 
			
			Hello,   
Latest on   is a preview of what will be a very loud Pontiak/White Hills show in Lausanne and aging bluesman Doug MacLeod's pair of Switzerland gigs in March.    
Yeasayer and Oh No Ono reviews are still relevant, as is the free download available of the High Places tune 'On Giving Up'.   
If anyone is interested in writing for the blog, do get in touch.   
Many thanks

			Hello,   
Slight blip in  momentum recently due to some niggly computer issues... but life has now returned and we have previews of upcoming shows from Morgan Geist in Zurich and Times New Viking in Lausanne. We shall see you there.   
LandLockedBlues     
			
			The Easter break is out the way and LandLockedBlues, for one, is looking forward to some stellar Switzerland shows in the coming weeks. Previews can be found of gigs from Los Angeles' High Places and from Canada-by-way-of-London, the mighty Caribou.    
The sun is coming out, friends   
LandLockedBlues     
			
			Hey great Blog and I have subscribed.    
May even have a go at writing a review myself.     
Keep up the good work.
		 
			
			Lausanne seems to get some pretty good gigs from smaller bands . . . Times New Viking, Crystal Antlers . . .  What drives the Lausanne scene?
		 
			
			Swissrob: thanks a lot for the kind words, you'd be most welcome to write something. Do let us know if you feel like penning an article, it will be warmly received.   
Gastro Gnome: Yeah I've noticed that too, particularly the Le Romandie venue over there. Obviously have some very imaginative promoters for such a small place.
		 
			
			These are the latest things to discover on LandLockedBlues:   
Modern soul from Mayer Hawthorne (Zurich)   
Modern folk from Tunng (Zurich)   
Some strange noises from Johnny Dowd (Zurich, Neuchatel, Basel)   
Some instruments being smacked around by Wildbirds and Peacedrums (Berne)   
Enjoy,

			Yep that's this Saturday. Almost a year after they played last in Switzerland, they are back to put on another blazing show. This time at Fri-Son in Freiburg. Tickets are only 22 CHF (25 with the starticket service charge).   
I would  classify the music as electronic but without computers, samplers as all  of the music is played live with keyboards and guitar pedals, drums.  Definitely one of the best live shows I've ever been too and I will  definitely be going to this one.   
Here's some examples of their stuff (check out Lovely Allen) from their  myspace page (the link gets filtered, but it should be the first thing that pops up on a google search).   
If anyone is interested in other details or the music appeals to anyone and folks are interested in  coming along PM me.

		    hahahahahaha! yesyoah!
		 
			
			BEP has been popular since before 2003.  They have had many more than just 1 or 2 hit songs.   
I will be at the concert with some friends from Basel and France!        Correct me if I am wrong but I think the OP was asking who wanted to go, not for conjecture on the merits of the group.
		 
			
			I'm looking for standing tickets for this gig if anyone has some available.   
(only seated tickets are still on sale)

What's the official face value for standing tickets?

PS: last time I was there, the place was full! So if thinking to come in a larger group, do reserve a table. And it's a restaurant, food is ok, averagely priced.
		 
			
			What a lovely lovely evening we had yesterday  
Baye Magatte Trio are great, very talented, and the voice... mmm    
Very passionate singing as well... even if I could not understand the words, he could really deliver the emotions! Very talented performer.  
He has his website and told that has some other performances in Basel. Highly recommend!

Big compliments to Union for organizing these events. Brings a lot awareness of cultural diversity to Swiss neighborhoods. Well, when a restaurant has a quote of Aung San Suu Kyi on its walls, you can't really expect low-q events of them

Friday 15 1. 10, clock 21:00, admission free!       
""Doctor Youssuf Deller's"" ethno project presents original compositions between East and West. Palatable ambient passages flirt with hefty Oriental grooves. These improvised and scattet Tassilo Deller, if he is good-humored, with Oriental-African scraps - and sometimes he even knows himself what he was singing!

Friday 22 1. 10, clock 21:00, admission free!     
Dark Fire Cloud of Lafayette, Louisiana (USA) had at the age of 7 years of the blues in his veins.

Returning to Louisiana, he founded the famous Zydecco-reggae band ""Sons of Selassie"". He now lives in Switzerland and is accompanied by the ""Stormy Seas congenial. 
Harmonica-String Rhythm Fusion ... Just positive!

Upstart Entertainment Presents       Auditions on May 25, 2010 from 6:30 p.m. (venue will be announced on registration) 
  This new musical weaves together the songs of Jacques Brel in a trip around the world. Brel was an accomplished sailor and aviator who dreamed of one day making a trip spanning the globe. Brels World uses his music to take the audience on the journey that Brel himself never made. 
  Jacques Brel is a Belgian singer-songwriter who was active in the 1950s and 60s and into the 70s. He died in 1979 at the age of 49. His songs draw on the French chanson and troubadour traditions while also blending in pop music. His lyrics span a wide range of feelings and emotions. They are romantic, loving, tough, cynical, hopeful. 
  Cast of Brels World: Strong characters who can portray the depth of Brels lyrics and verse.     The songs will be sung in four languages, the narration and dialogue is mostly in English The cast will be required to sing in English, French, German and Dutch.  
  For the auditions, please prepare one Jacques Brel song plus a song of your own choosing. In addition, you will be asked to deliver a monologue of your own choosing. Your choice of audition material should reflect your major strengths. Previous knowledge of Brel is not required although an affinity would be an advantage. 
  A list of songs from Brel's World is available on request.

			Does anyone know where I can get tickets for this event?           
			
			Yes.                           
			
			Thanks. But this site doesn't let you but tickets online it just recommends places to buy tickets. And it would seem none of those places allow you to buy on line either.   
Anywhere to buy Mumford and Sons tickets online?
		 
			
			It's Rote Fabrik. They don't normally have any online sales.
		 
			
			Thanks. Never been before, presume it is a good venue.         
			
			You can buy them in Jelmloli at the  Ticketvorverkau on the 4th floor. Got ours on Saturday CHF25 each - bargain and can't wait    
			
			Migros City on Löwenstrasse, Zurich sells RF tickets. Have a flirt with the lady there, she'll remember your face and keep the secret Blue Lines (White Stripes) concert tickets back for you. Give her your email, but hurry, word is out.
		 
			
			This is probably entirely too late that I saw this -but Bro Records let me buy my tickets through email and then mailed them to me...You could also reserve them then go pick them up a few places said...
		 
			
			secret what......?       
			
			Thanks to everyone for the input. I managed to get tickets from:-     crazy beat records   badenerstrasse 79   
I am now looking forward to the event!

			In case you are interested the program is available on the website and ticket sales are to open today:     
			
			One of the worst programmes for any festival I've ever seen.
		 
			
			Thing is that they know that the tickets will sell out almost immediately no matter what the line up is, so they dont seem to bother any more. Plus it has always had that mysterious (to me) world music and French chanson component. On the other hand it is the best festival I have ever been to (2000 to 2003), just such a great evening vibe and so much to see wandering around the grounds.
		 
			
			It is a shame that there is nothing particularly new if at all! some ok bands but for the price and close to Nyon I am starting to prefer Caribana and their line-ups however their ticket prices have also gone up alot in the past few years.
		 
			
			iggy is worth it, but jamiroquai is live so lame at festivals... 
2007 was great. björk, midlake and arcade fire...awesome!   
besides ist true: one of the best festivals (apart from that worldmusic stuff *yawn*)
		 
			
			Do you really have to buy a ticket? People told me that there also outside events which you dont need a ticket for. Are they right? I dont like any of the performances but i wouldnt mind wandering around nyon for a couple of hours
		 
			
			We went last year, there were quite a lot of touts at the entrance/in the car park on the night selling tickets.   
Nb. it's not in central Nyon - it's in some fields outside of town
		 
			
			it's not in nyon but in a cow pasture outside of town. but anyways, yes, there are always people selling tickets outside, including professional scalpers. i remember seeing this one guy a few years ago that i had bought tickets from in zurich about 3-4 years prior. what he was doing was walking against the crowd and buying tickets on the way out to the parking lot, then running back to the main gate and selling them there, at double the price.    
best to make a little sign for tickets and wait along the traffic line into the parking. if you wait until late, especially as the main act starts playing, you can get a significant discount. done that.       if you mean to get in there with not paying: not, you have to buy one. 
if you mean if you can buy one at the entrance: yes, but maybe to a rip-off price. no (rarely a) ticket office when sold out 
if you mean not to buy at the day the got sold online/ticketcorner etc: : no, its sold out VERY quick. but i believe not this year....
		    Ok.. Basically people told me that you dont need tickets just to wonder a bit around the place.  
Also how do you get there from the main station?
		    Could they be referring to the Montreux Jazz Festival ?
		 
			
			Well they did tell me it was Paleo but maybe they got confused. Have to clarify that. Thanks!
		 
			
			fyi, all days are sold out except for tuesday. but usually they sell a limited number of tickets the day of (or is it the day before?) the concert.
		 
			
			It is incredible that they can sell out a concert like that. It is indicative of the lack of quality live music events in Suisse Romande.
		 
			
			Prodigy was nice last year, but I don't think I'll be going this time around :\   
Maybe I'll attend something like the NIFFF instead... and probably walk around Montreux on the Jazz Festival.
		 
			
			i don't really find a lack of quality in the area- at least it's better than i thought it would be coming from nyc but i admit this years line up sucks!!!!! went last year and it's a great festival in itself- so much food/drink options if thats your thing but lots to do as well. last year was great- santogold was my personal highlight- i was on stage dancing with her!!!! that made me love paleo... but it's a good huge crowd of people looking to enjoy.   
			
			I don't want to be a downer, especially in terms of any muzzak fun, but I can't stand the overpriced, overvisited festival biz. Somehow the overorganized nature of these things here lose appeal for me. It is a few kms from us, but I will go if we actually play, haha...Wish it was a bit more low key. Though, the food people talk about is tempting..      From the Paleo website:       
			
			Gata - to reply yes they have a large camping/type area outside of the paleo entrance that has loads of stalls and one place for bands and stuff so yeah worth going especially as geneva is so close.  You do need to take the ""little red train"" from Nyon station but it is free and you get there in a few mins.  A good laugh especially if the weather is good.  I may go to the camping part Saturday as I dont feel like getting a ticket so PM me if you want to catch up.    
			
			I mentioned Nyon as that is the closest town and I didn't think ""in the middle of a cow pasture near Nyon"" would fit in the title.   
I never go to hear an actual band, usually just to hang out and eat at the stalls, and laugh at the Milk stand... and sometimes there is a not very well known band that surprises me    
You have to buy a ticket to go in, there are is no free stuff outside the gates like at Montreux Jazz or Cully.   
There is a bus-shuttle from the Nyon train station to the festival grounds.  You can also drive, though if you don't get there early enough you have to walk almost the same distance as from the train.
		 
			
			There is a Milk stand?? Cool!  
Harvey Milk stand would be even cooler..   
There are a few fests going on, Caribana as well, they have some kind of kid muzzak going on, might be fun. I like smaller venues.

I am up for this but will have to wait till the Mrs. is back from a trip to see if she wants to come, not to keen in Mr. Def I would think.   
If you like Mos Def, you'll love this guy     
Very similar music styles, I might have to pass on Mos because Mr. Scott-Heron is playing in London around this time.   
Get a taste here:     
			
			Time for a bump.
		 
			
			enjoy!!! going to see him here in lausanne next week-    
			
			Does anyone have 2 extra tickets to Mos Def?????   
Pleeeeease??
		 
			
			I'll be warming up at my place with my friend.  People are welcome to join or we can arrange to meet up at Rote Fabrik before the show.  Since it's gonna be nice Sat, we could have dinner on their lovely patio.
		 
			
			Anyone... mos def tix... pretty please with sugar on top...
		    Just wondring , its sold out or your looking for freebies ?
		 
			
			The show is sold out, but with the Rote Fabrik, they sometime have a few tickets at the door.  Hope to see some of you tomorrow.

No bands though in the diary for the near future, but DJs and a couple of English comedy events on the 13th and 14th April; blimey, that's tomorrow and the night after.          I think I know who you mean and he's Scottish. He used to play at the Pickwick every first Monday of the month with his band ""Triple Bypass"" and now he has a new band called ""Shotgun Momma"" you can look up on the Pickwick Zug webpage when they are playing.

			Hi   
Is anyone going to VFestival (Chelmsford - UK) this year?       
			
			Here is the linky:       
Great line-up!
		 
			
			Fancy going?    
I don't have tickets yet... didn't buy any as my UK friends aren't going this year... but the line-up is almost too good to be missed.
		 
			
			Hi, 
Yeah my son has got tickets. Hes really excited about going.
		 
			
			Seriously interested.    
			
			Festival is sold out, but you can always get tickets... might have to put in a few more bucks though.
		 
			
			I have opted for Exit Festival in Serbia this year  .
		 
			
			Wow, didn't know Chelmsford has its own fest. I saw Chumbawumba last time when I was there, when they were still punks.
		 
			
			Paul Weller - yes!   
Cheryl Cole... Are you kidding ;-)
		    Doubt she will be there. She would have shrunk down to nothing by then.
		 
			
			Would love to see Groove Armada again. They are amazing with a full band in tow.
		 
			
			I don't know where to start...... Kings of Leon, Prodigy, Mika, Calvin Harris, Florence and the Machine, La Roux, Faithless,  etc..... I really want to go.
		 
			
			If anyone has a spare ticket, I would of course be very happy to take it    
			
			I went last year and had a great time - am really gutted this year as the line up is MUCH better!!  I got my ticket from ebay fairly last minute and paid only £30 over the ticket price - which I thought was worth it.   
If I hear of anything going I'll let you know - they always seem to come up.   
This year instead I am graduating and going to Glastonbury and then via Hyde Park for KOL    
			
			i will visit the friday of hard rock calling at the hyde park with  the hives, pearl jam, the gaslight anthem..........(both other days are not my type of music)

			Yeah - we got our tickets yesterday  My husband's an absolute, dedicated, long-term fan of EC. We've seen him in Basel before and the atmosphere there is usually fantastic.
		 
			
			Have a great time. Should be a sell out. Ive already got my tickets on E-Bay.

Thanks

			A friend of mine just saw the tour in Miami and said that Clapton struggled vocally. I loved Winwood's last CD ""Nine Lives"" some very strong songs on there. Not sure if I'll go though.

			I know Switzerland has certain age limits for movie theaters.  Anyone know if there are age limits for concerts, particularly for stadium concerts?
		 
			
			I've been going to concerts here with some friends since I've been 13 so I doubt theres any age restrictions, although I'm not sure what happens if 5 year olds turn up with tickets    
where there are restrictions are concerts at clubs. There it's normally the normal club age restrictions
		 
			
			I wish there had been an age limit on concerts tonight.    
No middle aged irritating men with big fat cigars - and especially not right in the thick of it, at the front      
ahhhh that feels better    
			
			Nicky, that's what happens when middle-aged women go to concerts in Switzerland ...    
Who did you see?  Tom Jones?  Engelbert Humperdinck?   
(scurries for cover)
		 
			
			The U2 concert has some blurb about a lower age restriction. 6, if I remember correctly.
		 
			
			It's usually listed on the website of whomever is selling tickets.
		    If you wear a checked shirt and your waistband around your ribcage, you've hit the limit.
		     
Oh, that's cool.  Thanks.  I was actually thinking about taking my kids to the U2 concert.
		    ok busted        
It's alright.  I heard Tom Jones still rocks... kinda.      
			
			there are age limits to certain concert....i always check before i take my son...    Eintritt ab 16 Jahren, oder in Begleitung eines Erwachsenen. (Jan Delay..Maag Hallen)
		     I never paid him much attention, but his cover of   with The Cardigans really took me by surprise.

			Just the big heads up on Pat Metheny's Orchestrion tour, coming to the Volkshaus, Zurich, 12 March 2010.   
Reviews have been outstanding, Metheny raising the bar again, this time as solo human artist with his giant   set up.  Pure jazzists who have been following Metheny like me for several decades, and who have seen the Orchestrion tour in other European cities, have come away absolutely mesmerized.       
It promises to be a great great gig.

			Definitely up for a drink or two beforehand.  Big Ben's West sounds about right.
		 
			
			Only recently just heard about her (them?) from this forum.  I do like the latest album, might see if I can make it.
		 
			
			Hello there, 
If any of you hear of any spare tickets going, please let me know! I am desparate to go - I adore Florence! I had tickets to see her in Berlin (hence didnt book for Zurich) last weekend and I missed the gig due to my own stupidity. I was so convinced I had read Saturday on the tickets, and then when I got the tickets out to go, I saw it was friday. Too late, money wasted and not only was  I gutted to not see Flo, but I felt like a prize idiot too. :-(
		 
			
			That's a rough mistake, ScientistMel.  I presume then the Zurich show is sold out.  Hope you find a ticket.
		 
			
			Tickets still for sale on Starticket...
		 
			
			Thanks so much for the ticket advice. I have my flo tickets for Zurich and am v happy indeed. I thought I had already checked everywhere, including starticket but maybe something had gone wrong. 
Saw her at Reading festival last year and her voice was astonishing, and coupled with being mad as a box of frogs, makes a brilliant show!
		 
			
			So we meeting for dinner and/or drinks beforehand?
		 
			
			Can't do dinner but we are meeting others in the IQ bar at 18 o'clock.
		 
			
			Anyone got or know of anyone selling 2 tickets?? Official outlets are sold out I believe.
		 
			
			There's usually an Abendkasse - even if they claim in advance there's not - or some lost soul selling single tix. And if all else fails, Mikey, you could try for a dangerw*** in the crush of people waiting to get in.
		 
			
			Cheers, dude. DWing would happen regardless, it's not a fallback option!   
Now looking for just the one ticket.    
			
			I'm a bit slow off the mark for this one but if there are any spare tickets floating around give me a shout. Cheers...
		 
			
			Big Ben or IQ bar; which is it?  I'll go where the cooler people go.    
			
			I'm so excited about this gig       i am cool, so is mikey, dan is only mildly cool though  
where is IQ bar hash?
		    At Escher-Wyss.   
Given that Mr Hall has not replied and that Bananahead has indicated IQ Bar, I say we join them at IQ Bar.
		    ok, so as bananahead has suggested, from 6 pm onwards at IQ bar - see you all then!    
			
			What! Mikey is coming.  Man .....
		 
			
			Yep and still looking for 2 tickets for Hugh to the Abu!
		    *looks in his wardrobe and realises the truth hurts*       Thought you'd given up being Hugh's bitch.
		       only kidding dan dan     stand next to me love, my coolness will rub off  - oor er   
			
			What time does the show actually start (I don't care when doors open).  They are always annoyingly on time in CH for concerts.
		 
			
			Answering my own question:  19.00 Uhr     20.00 Uhr    23.00 Uhr
		 
			
			what time is kick off? 
I am some interviewing to do and won't leave the office til 19.00

So, Florry and the Mechanics on stage by 21.00?
		 
			
			There are some people meeting at Les Halles at 7pm, so will drop by IQ and then head over there, as I love Les Halles and haven't been there in ages.

			So, that was all kinds of awesome       did eric just leave then?    
			
			Kinda, he had to go get a train to Basel. He did say goodbye to whoever was around        Yeah but if I'd been there, Val couldn't have been, so in the end it was for the best

			The Underground Sessions steps it up a gear with 2 fantastic musicians. There have been a lot of changes at the venue and there will be a few more before this gig but rest assured that this is going to be a defining moment for the Sessions. 
Mark Kelly is a fantastic singer/songwriter originally from Manchester but currently residing Swiss side we are really excited to have him play, a real honour! 
Joining him will be the elusive James Carrington, he pulled a little on the line but we finally managed to reel him in to play for definate this time! His music has been used in such shows as Smallville and E.R. and he is signing to a major label too! He flys over from London exclusively to play this night! 
All in all an amazing night of acoustic pleasure awaits ...... look forward to seeing you all there, 
all love

			Portuguese pianist, Maria Joao Pires will be performing in Luzern's KKL on  She will be performing in a charity concert with the Human Rights Orchestra which includes many instrumentalists from Europe's major orchestras such as the Berliner Philharmoniker, Lucerne Festival Orchestra, Orchestra Mozart Bologna, who offer their services to raise awareness of human rights issues as well as to raise funds to support grassroots organizations.   
Considered one of the best interpretors of Chopin, Schubert and Mozart's music, she is a poet amongst many musicians. She is also famously reclusive and her concert appearances rare - hence definitely an opportunity of a lifetime!! WOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOO!

			Hello, has anyone got spare La Roux tickets that they'd like to sell?  Please PM me if by any remote chance you find yourself with 2 tickets that you've now discovered you can't use.  Her show on 3rd March in Zurich is sadly already sold out.  Who'd have thought that flame-haired, falsetto-warbling offspring of police-based soap actors would be popular over here?  Thanks.
		 
			
			You're gonna have to probably get it from some 16 year old. Thats the majority of the audience right there    
			
			I'm also looking for a couple tickets.   
I really didn't like her first time I heard her, but it grows on you.
		    Me too.  Your ears sort of atune to the reedy high-upness.
		 
			
			I think she has a double-spiked demographic:  16 year olds and those old enough to remember ""Living On The Ceiling"" by Blancmange.  Sadly, I'm in the latter category.
		 
			
			After hearing her performance of ""in for the kill"" on Jools Holland I'm not sure a live show is that desirable. On the other hand I like the style and any excuse to get some more wear from my 80's wardrobe seems like a good idea.
		    I think it's probably much broader than that.   
The Kitsuné crowd runs right through the twenties into the thirties . . .
		 
			
			So... Anyone got any tickets they'd like to part with?

			For those who are interested, or may be interested, Xavier Rudd is coming to Bern (at the Bierhubeli) on Feb 21 and Zurich (at the Kauflueten) on Feb 22.  Show starts at 20:00 (doors open at 19:00).    
Anyway, a fellow EFer and I are going to the show in Zurich (already got our tickets) and wanted to make everyone aware.  I would describe his music as having a reggae-type vibe and he plays the digeridoo as well as an assortment of other instruments (all barefoot by the way).

			Hello everyone!   
Just thought I'd drop this one in.   
On the 13th of February five Swiss bands will be rocking the stage at the Papiersaal. The whole thing's called ""Monkeys on Stage"":    
It's a concert series that has started last April and is on going successfully, it's the third MOS, and it's gonna be great.   
So for anyone who likes rock'n'roll and a good concert, for all those who are interested in what good swiss rock sounds like. See you there!    
Cheers

			Just a heads up to anyone out there waiting for U2's 360 Tour to come to Switzerland. Looks like they are coming to Zurich's Dübendorf Airfield next year. Most likely early September - will be confirmed before too long I expect        
			
			U2 are great, I went to their 360tour in London, I'm tempted to go again!!!
		 
			
			doh.  we got tickets to the paris show.  
oh well.  will likely go to zurich as well    
			
			Confirmed, well. . . At Letzigrund  
Sep 11th 2010  
45chf to 380 chf    
28.01.10 presale    
Enjoy
		 
			
			Note the venue has changed to Letzigrund. Also the cheapest seats are CHF45.
		 
			
			Is there a presale code?
		 
			
			where can I buy the tickets
		 
			
			Where's Letzigrund? So I know to avoid it       Do you have to be a VIP member on ticketcorner to enjoy this presale?       I guess so although the details have yet to make it to ticketcorner.com. Usually they will do a VIP presale the day before the general public onsale date. Alternatively paid membership of the u2.com fansite may entitle you to a presale but details have yet to make it to their website.    
Whatever the scenario the event is likely to sell out fast given the relatively small capacity of the stadium. Wouldn't be at all surprised to see a second date added on the 10th or 12th after this date sells out.
		 
			
			You're right, second date announced for 12.09.2010

			Advance notice for this concert. 13th - 17th April 2010.   
Artists have not been advised yet. Previous performers have included Jon Lord, Nazareth and Suzanne Vega to name just a few.

			Thanks for the heads up DP (I saw Deep Purple the band not the EF dude  when 1 was 16, and again 3 years ago in La Rochelle)    
Road trip Natasha      I  have seen them a couple of months ago in Arbon, but that is another story.   
I will sort out tickets much earlier this time if the line up looks good.  It would be great if Jon Lord returns.  He has played in Zermatt several times.
		 
			
			The long awaited line up for this has been announced. A bit disappointing for me and I won't be attending.   
I am sure that there are some names that will appeal to many of you, but not me particularly.   
Artists include Lionel Ritchie, Billy Idol and Newton Faulkner.     #   
Edit: A new headline act is to be announced tomorrow. Perhaps the organisers felt the same as me. (Or do they look at EF?  )

			Well here goes....    
For chitter and chatter about gigs up and coming to run along side the wonderfully implemented calendar events and for the numpty simpletons like me who prefer the old fashioned way      
hopefully this will replace Jot's great 'Zurich Gig Guide' from the past - but will please all the unfortunate bumpkins that live outside the canton of Zurich    
			
			Why is it that some people have so much difficulty dealing with change?   
IMO This thread is pointless and selfish.
		 
			
			I was sure I was going to get groans for that and they will all be from people living in or around Zürich...   
When in real life a small group of people sharing the same interests (for example Zürich inhabitants, blondes, Audi TT owners, whatever...) joins up with a bigger group (for example Switzerland inhabitants, ladies who like to dye their hair, Audi owners...), you can then tell them a 1000 times that it doesn't make sense them staying together in their small group, that they should open up to the other people...If they don't want to change they won't.
		    well then go to this   instead? we cater for all    
			
			Primal Scream Xtra 16 th August.
		    Are you going Annie and Nicky? We may have to re-arrange my schedule a bit so we can go because they are good live.
		 
			
			We are Nigel, booked our tickets today.
		    Not sure yet - not listened to any of their recent stuff
		 
			
			The latest album is really good. Check out the website    
We now have tickets as well.       
I am also wondering about the Delilahs at Kaufleuten on 13th August.
		    Don't you think that there are Primal Scream fans living outside of Zurich?
		    Primal Scream are playing in Zurich therefore it is a 'Zurich Gig' - I created another thread to post gigs in Switzerland should anyone wish to....
		    Grrr.... 
Zurich is in Switzerland.
		    Why don't we have ""Yawn"" button as well as Thanks & Groan?
		 
			
			Well you all found this thread about Primal Scream playing in Zurich so whats the fuss.      PS I dont live in Zurich Kanton.      I found it because I actually live in Zurich and am registered to this thread.   
But why should a Primal Scream fan who does not live in Zurich have to wade through 10 pages of Zurich concerts to discover that his favourite band is going to play in Switzerland?   
If you want to keep this thread fair enough but please also add the events to the Concerts Calendar!
		    Who let you in? Anyways, this thread is far more pointless and selfish, it's only for Zurich Stadt       True but we should also have a ""This poster is being selfish"" button that would be worth 10 groans.
		    Why register to something that seems to cause you so much angst    
Anyone only using this ""Heads Up"" thread or the EF concert guide is going to miss out on plenty of things they might like anyway. It contains a mere fraction of what is going on. Compare it to a comprehensive gig guide eg   ,   etc   
Real gig guides exists elsewhere, so I certainly can't be bothered replicating them on EF. Call me selfish if you must, but it only caters for those who like to be.....       
			
			We have the Concert Calendar, we also have the Zurich Gig Guide thread and the Switzerland Gig Guide thread - is this not enough?    
Martin if you want to add Primal Scream into the calendar then go ahead - Mannie Organ decided to post it here and that is entirely her choice but it does not stop you creating an event   
After the demise of the Zurich gig guide some people (me included) missed having a general thread to chat about and mention up and coming gigs.   
I am sure people living elsewhere can still look at at this thread if they see a new post added to it - especially if they are interested in music and are willing to travel - if someone decided to create a Basel Gig Guide I would follow it, just because i Live in Zurich doesn't mean i wouldn't be interested in gigs in other cities   
where's the flogging a dead horse icon for this bleedin topic......
		 
			
			Martin - you groaned Mannie Organ for merely posting a gig that is happening in Zurich in the Zurich Gigs ""heads Up"" thread, do you really believe that deserves a groan? as far as she is aware she is posting in the right place... really some people.....
		    The difference between the EF concerts calendar and a general events website is that the concerts mentioned on here are focused towards the expat community.    
According to your reasoning if information that was already available on the Internet should not be added to the EF then there wouldn't be much content on the EF.   
What I don't understand is why you can't create a Primal Scream Concert thread on the calendar for the 16th August and then have your discussion there: ""Are you going?"", ""No I am going on holiday"", ""Pity because Primal Scream are good"" etc... ?
		    Go for it Martin, very happy for you to go and post the event in the calendar, jeeze I'll do it if it will make you happy?
		    No I groaned at her because she knows of a good concert that could interest other expats but decided not to add it to the Calendar.
		    everytime this thread gets bumped to the top, i think there's a new concert...       I posted it in the Zurich thread because the bloody concert is in Zurich,end of story.          Most of the gigs I go to are with Swiss people. They have remarkably the same taste in music as ""expats"". EF is intended to be a ""Community portal for English-speaking people in Switzerland"", not an expat ghetto.      People do often refer to outside web sources. The real value of EF is in the info that isn't so easy to find, and peoples experience and opinions.      I've not been overwhelmed by the volume of your contributions to this calendar (was it zero or nil?). It's a bit rich to be handing out tit-for-tat groans to contributors and using that as an excuse.
		    That is the whole point of my groan. If you post your comments and information somewhere in the middle of a gigantic Zurich Concerts thread it will not be easy to find.
		     gigantic one and a bit pages.
		    Exactly the problem, and not exactly unexpected.  That is why I wonder why there are mutliple gig threads.  It serves no purpose other than to keep those in Zurich happy and the rest of the board uninformed.
		 
			
			I give up.      see everyone uses things differently, I prefer this way rather than the concerts calendar, the gig is posted and then if no one adds a comment to that event then it gets lost in the pile - whereas I see a new gig added to this and it appears in 'new posts', if i decide i want to go to the event mentioned I put it in my own calendar, I find this solution easier, however i appreciate that you don't, we can't please everyone and I think it will just have to be give and take   
If in the future you see a gig mentioned on this or the other thread and you want to create an event in the concerts calendar then go ahead but don't groan at people if they have chosen this method if that's what THEY prefer   
Nicky
		    For the moment but by August it would theoretically be longer.
		    It's a conspiracy for sure.   
Magnolia Electric Co.  25 Sept  El Lokal , Z*****
		    And why not post it to the general concerts thread?  Do you specificaly not want others to know about it?  Or do you feel too many concerts go on in the rest of the country that it would be lost?
		    Cyrus I didn't post it in here but I actually advised Mannie Organ to post it in here so yes slapped wrist - but it is actually a Zurich concert, not exclusive to Zurichers but it is happening in Zurich - the thread exists and it seemed a suitable place   
I think you are being a bit pedantic over this... is it really all that important? a gig is happening in Zurich and it was posted in the Zurich Gigs 'Heads Up' thread       It is pedantic, but it's not just me being pedantic is it?  I just feel everyone is better of with a general concert thread, but those from Zurich can't seem to post their concerts to a thread that doesn't have the word ""Zurich"" in it.
		    I think 'those' from Zurich can (if they want) Mannie Organ isn't even bloody from Zurich she posted it here because the event is IN Zurich, quite a logical decision do you not think, when confronted with 2 threads, one called Switzerland Gig Guide and the other Zurich Gigs ""heads up""    
Basically don't blame the messenger, it's the mods decision what to do with the two threads and so far they have been left as they are, so...... a user comes along and posts a zurich gig in the zurich gig thread and she gets groaned and hassled about it       
			
			Ok, to summarise:   
There was a Zurich Concerts thread, people weren't happy and made a General concerts thread. Then people weren't happy because gigs in their area were getting lost in the big General concerts thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... People still weren't happy so there was a Concerts forum created.    
People still weren't happy because they could only discuss a particular concert in a thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... then the non Zurich people got pissed off...     
FFS people, no one is going to be happy all the time. Its not the end of the world, get off your high horses (Did Hsiang ever find out where to procure one?) and go to whatever concerts you want to. If a gig is in Zurich why can't the people that live in Zurich discuss it in a Zurich based thread. If they were going to go to a gig in Luzern I'm sure they wouldn't object to it being in a Luzern gigs thread.    
I think a certain amount of ""cop the f**K on"" is needed here.
		    Actually the old Zurich concert threads served well for all concerts in the country, because most concerts happen in Zurich, there were no other threads.  I thought a title change would be appropriate to reflect the actual content of the thread, but obviously, that was just too much.
		    Well then you should have left well enough alone and not tried to fix what was not broken.       But why on earth do you guys have to have these general threads why not simply create an individual thread for each concert and discuss the specifics there.   
That was Nathu's aim when he created the Concerts calendar.   
This reminds of procedural language programmers who couldn't understand object-oriented programming: Now every concert is one object.
		    Because maybe they don't want to!   
You are still perfectly entitled to post the concert in the concerts thread should you so desire.
		 
			
			It's annoying me now how I bang on about it, I understand how some people prefer a single thread and some like the events, but I simply cannot understand why we have 2 seperate stickies simply confusing the issue.     
All gigs posted here will be in Switzerland, most will be in Zurich, why is it so hard to not have a single thread with a title that accurately reflects the contents ""Upcoming Concerts"" or some such, then acts will be picked up by all who might not otherwise consider a trip out of town.  Instead we have 2 threads, or one thread with an inaccurate title.
		 
			
			Now that 50% of the dissenters have annoyed themselves, can we move to the next part of this thread cycle please?   
Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism -> thread users discuss thread -> long period of silence -> thread users think it safe -> Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism ->
		 
			
			Er, I support the use of the Concerts Calendar - which should be merged with the main calendar IMO; let's have a huge 'What's On' section with overview - rather than having lots of different threads.   
There was some arcane rule about not posting an event on the calendar if you weren't intending to attend; surely that's not necessary? Should there be a concert, is it not easier to have it on the calendar? One concert has no relevence to any other and threads like this spin outta control... although something is better than nothing.   
And it's Zürchers, not Zürichers       Oh yes, above it all aren't we? but can't possibly post to a concerts thread without Zurich being in the title.
		 
			
			right i have to dash off to catch a flight very shortly but as an interim would it make everyone happy if I merge this thread with the Switzerland Gig Guide thread and just have the one thread from now on    
The Zurich guide i really don't think was created intentionally to p!ss off Cyrus and Martin but it seems to have done anyway and I think they'll be banging on about it until the cows come home, so I'll merge and we'll just have one generic thread - which will eliminate their the 'them and us' belief   
Agreed?
		 
			
			Right threads merged - it's all a bit of a jumble - i will attempt to edit it when i get chance
		 
			
			I was going to post earlier, but it felt a little childish   
For fans of electro pop, the excellent   are coming to CH   
Stall 6, Zurich, 2/6 and 
Volkshaus, Basel on 3/6
		    Can I now be picky and ask for it to be renamed ""Switzerland Gigs ""Heads Up"" or ""Switzerland Gigs Discussion"" or ""Switzerland Rough Gig Guide""? Cos it aint a gig guide.
		    ah it could have gone in the other thread

(to avoid a sh!t fight based re: the usual argument: Zurich vs rest of the known universe, if someone feels like popping this on the gig-calendar please feel free. i don't know how. :-) )   
they will also be at Gurten for those who are going

			Yeah, I think that its because you were only allowed to buy the tickets when they were released if you were a VIP member of ticketcorner.com. Totally sucks as now all the 'ticket dregs' are left. Anyhow, I managed to buy 2 tickets for the UK so will be seeing them there.    
			
			Someone wants to come?           
Thats gonna be my first concert here! Great start    
			
			I wouldn't mind going to see Gossip tonight at Kaufleuten, but they sold out at starticket, does anyone know if they sell tickets on the door?   
I don't want to travel all the way to Zurich and find I can't get in.
		 
			
			A bit short notice but, tonight I can completely recommend both of the bands that will be playing in the restaurant, if it rains, or just outside on the terrace if it doesn't, at the Rote Fabrik. The bands are, in no particular order, Sein and Attwenga. 
Thankyou for your time.

			Wilco play the Volkshaus on November 11th, tickets from CHF55.-   
Peaches plays 8th September, from CHF55.-   
Goran Bregovic also plays there 23rd April, 2010 ( ) from CHF65.-
		    play the Club at the Theater Spektakel in Zürich Tuesday 18th August, bringing some spooky Ethiopean jazz grooves to the shores of the lake of Zurich. If you weren't in Addis Ababa before 1974, you'll know their music from the Jim Jarmusch film 'Broken Flowers'    
Fire        
			
			This used to work much better when it was a single thread called Zurich Gig Guide 2009 in social events.                      play the Mascotte in Zurich again on December 5th. They're also supporting Muse at the Hallenstadion on November 18th. A good show       It doesn't work because you aren't using the system correctly.
		 
			
			Martin he is using the system how he would like to use it - please quit with groans because someone disagrees with you.   
There are many who no longer benefit from the new system me included - I know a lot of time and effort went into creating the concerts calendar but i feel it is not as effective as the handy gig guide thread we had before. I am finding out about less gigs now because people are just not posting them. It's quick and easy to post on here and many people are short of time and don't wish to create an event.   
So please, we know you don't like this method, but we don't like the other method so can we be grown up and not groan the users who would like to carry on down this route?   
Bannahead thanks for those 3 updates - I am sure in the old system these would have been announced sooner so I hope there are still tickets left for Temper Trap   
Cheers  
Nicky
		    ...It's not that we don't wish to creat an event, but we're following previous rules asking us not to create events if we don't intend / sure if we're going. This is a ""Heads Up"" thread.   
On that note, the rather loud and rocking  play the Rote Fabrik this coming Sunday 20th. Last time they played there were about 7 people in the Ziegel; one was a waiter, one at the bar, two groupies and me and my two mates   A private party!    
There're really quite good, despite the crowds...
		    I agree UM this is why i don't use this calendar event because a) I am unsociable and don't want a crowd tagging along with me at a gig   and b) sometimes I find out about a gig want to tell others but may not be going myself   
I just don't want to get into the whole gigs head up guide v concerts calendar debate again - there was no happy outcome the last time so why can't each person just do as they wish and post a gig ho they want?    
I like this method and it worked for many years and was updated regularly - at least 2 to 3 times a week a new gig would be posted on here and it was always my most favourote thread, it's now died a death and it's a shame    
			
			I haven't posted because I haven't seen anything I liked, it's been quiet over summer.   
Here's a couple to get the thread started again.   
25.10 Micachu and the Shapes / The Invisibles, Zukunft, Zurich   
12.11 Passion Pit, Alte Borse, Zurich   
20.11 The Field, Palace, St. Gallen   
25.11 Massive Attack, Eishalle Deutweg Winterthur   
3.12 Punks Jump Up, Hive, Zurich   
5.12 The Heavy, Palace, St. Gallen
		 
			
			Massive Attack, even antisocial me might be interested in that.       And where do I fit in to that description? I'm still fearful of crossing paths with the FOTL boys after the death look they gave me for buying a bottle of wine at the counter, it was for DaveA I tells ya! Don't think we'll see the likes of a FOTL & Black Mountain ""restaurant"" gig again soon   
Anyways here is my heads up, El Lokal to the rescue in October with varying shades of classy Americana in one hell of a week:   
Oct 18 - Mark Eitzel (American Music Club) 
Oct 22 - Joseph Arthur (last time I saw him was supporting R.E.M.) 
Oct 25 - Richmond Fontaine (Uncut Magazine's favourite story tellers)
		    Oh boy oh boy, Good work, El Lokal       Palace in St Gallen is a very good venue. Dont be scared to stand in front of the ""seat"" people though.        This is your opinion. And you are wrong.   
Along with Nicky, I do not want to reopen the whole Zurich Gig Guide versus Calendar discussion because it got boring very quickly. However, I will not be posting any events         
Sadly I won't be able to attend The XX gig and I am mightily disappointed.
		     
I like the recent albums but I'm not sure how it will work live.
		 
			
			Camera Obscura - 13th Oct - Abart, Zurich   
White Lies - 14th Nov - Kaufleuten, Zurich
		 
			
			Someone here on EF is nutty for them if remember correctly....   
Ultravox - Volkshaus Zurich - 15 April 2010   
with Midge Ure back up front.
		 
			
			It's a good week for indie music in Zürich with Au Revoir Simone on Tuesday and Yacht last night (which was great!).   
This evening Girls are playing at Exil.   
They have an interesting personal history, having grown up in the Children of God cult, being heavily involved with drugs and being adopted by a billionaire . . . or something.   
The music is psychedelic, influenced by the Beach Boys and shoegaze.
		 
			
			Who are the ""Girls"" ?     
as you can imagine, googling is pointless ... what do I google? Girls in Zurich, Girls group, Girls music ...
		 
			
			Anyone interested in seeing Alice In Chains in Fribourg start of december?   
A bit of a different band from their Grunge days, could be interesting
		    Well I did explain a little bit in my original post . . .   
More here:          If only I noticed earlier      
The debut album - imaginatively titled Album - is in the post   
Did you go? Were they good?       
And now for a plug          Unfortunately they started at 11.30 which was a bit late for a school night, so I decided against it.   
In other news . . . Patrick Wolf is playing at Mascotte on Wednesday. Anyone going? Or want to go? If you are it would be nice to meet up . . . PM me.       
			
			FYI - for any Aussies out there Eskimo Joe is playing tonight in Bern at the Bier Huebli           
cheers   
Nic
		 
			
			It would seem that The Joy Formidable are supporting The Temper Trap.   
Check out the video here      
How can you not love this band.
		 
			
			for the U2 fans out there, heard that they'll be playing in zurich next summer... can anyone confirm?
		   I'm looking forward to see KING AUTOMATIC at the longstreet bar 4.11.09 @2100h
Now that is something worth going to see..       I watched their video, what a bunch of w@nkers!
		    Not definitively but I can say the stage diagrams /architect plans have been drawn up (see  ), permission for a concert at Dubendorf Airfield has been granted, and I would expect a concert date sometime in the first half of September 2010 to be announced in the next week or two.
		 
			
			...are playing at the Volkhaus on 28.01.10...(I know I know, that's ages away, but being in CH...)   
I think tickets are around CHF50 , but you'll get excellent riffage for your frank, and the support is sure to be good....       
You know it makes sense!
		 
			
			Looking forward to the Temper trap in a few weeks. Got a few mates coming. Anyone interested in meeting up, PM me
		 
			
			Ian Brown is playing at Abart in Zurich on the 18th January. Tickets are now available.   
Should be a great gig if he manages to keep out of trouble with the dibble between now and then.
		 
			
			I just hope that he doesn't get bottled like  the last time he played Rohstofflager.   
Ian went offstage for a break, the roadies were switching out the Fender guitars and bringing the Gretsches onstage. This suggests the likelihood of an encore filled with Stone Roses songs. He wasn't offstage for more than 3 minutes and the idiots behind started throwing filled cups of beer towards the stage, coating us in the front row and the instruments on stage. They were asked to stop, but the continued. The lights came on the, the roadies got all the gear off stage and the Ian didn't come back on to play an encore that would have included a bunch of Roses tracks   , (as indicated on the setlist i collected)   
I really hope the Abart crowd are a bit more sensible.               is playing at the Salzhaus in Winterthur on Sunday, 22 Nov 2009   
And me sadly up in Germany...
		 
			
			The Living End - Aussie pub rock   
Monday 23 Nov Abart Zurich.   
Any interest?             
			
			Scout Niblett's at Abart on at Exil on December 3rd.   
Dinosaur Egg!
		    will be there with the missus and some mates   
went to high school with these guys       At Abart or Exil?   Put the gin bottle down, man.
		    Naughty Hendricks!   
It'sh Exil . . .       
			
			for those going to Temper Trap on the 2nd Dec - the venue has been changed to the Abart
		 
			
			Living End - what a gig man!!!    
AWESOME !!
		    YEA - it was an amazing show!!! And I liked how the venue was really stretched to it's limit, with a crowd surfer almost kicking down a ceiling-mounted stage light and with the bass literally lifting the roof      
best CHF36 I ever spent in Switzerland    
			
			A great venue for a great Band:   
Stereophonics.  
09.02.2010.  
Palais Xtra. ZH
		 
			
			The Temper Trap is playing at Abart Zurich on 2nd. December. 
Is anyone going as well?
		 
			
			Wow just listened to some Youtube vids (Science of Fear, Sweet Disposition and Fader) and they are pretty damn awesome, in fact very awesome, I really like the sound.   
Abart is 50m from my apartment too. Very tempted, will talk to my friend and look at tickets tommorrow. Thanks for the heads-up man.    
			
			You're welcome. Love Abart as it's a smaller venue AND it has a Bar    
			
			got the tickets as soon as i saw they are in CH. really looking forward to seeing them..
		 
			
			Also already secured my tickets for Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten on 22. February. He's amazing live and it will sell-out really fast. Just to give everyone the head's up.      Same here. Should be rad.    
And yep Xaiver Rudd is a go-a in December. Will bet tickets asap
		 
			
			I'll be there at Temper trap - looking forward to it - shame they changed the venue though
		    Thanks for the heads up...I would've turned up at hafenkneipe blissfully unaware that they had changed the venue otherwise. Oh well, bang goes my 3 minute walk...   
Should be an awesome gig though, can't wait to see them live.
		    ...and bang it goes to Richdog. Abarte is at the end of my street.    
Really looking forward to the gig, booking tickets tommorrow.       But Xavier Rudd is in February next year not December?
		 
			
			oops my bad. May miss it cause i'll be in Australia either feb or march
		 
			
			Biffy Clyro is playing at Mascotte in Zurich this Saturday. 
Also for those who have missed it, Editors are playing at X-tra in Zurich with support by the Maccabees! Should be a great gig.
		    Its annoying that one,we are booked for the editors,but would have really liked to see Biffy Clyro.
		 
			
			Same here. Difficult choices      me too - they supported Muse but really we were so far away and as usual the sound is rubbish in Hallenstadion and especially for the support acts. Would have been good to see them in a smaller venue   
see you Sat Mrs O
		 
			
			see you in the bar.
		 
			
			Just seen Filastine is playing at exil in Zurich tomorrow (Friday).  Think that might be mighty interesting.
		     
4th February   at abart   
10th March   at rohstofflager
		    She must have liked it here last time!
		 
			
			David Grey for anyone interested   
X-tra 7th Feb
		    I missed both these on their first visit, hopefully get to see them both on their second
		    Cool i might be keen for that
		 
			
			Gentleman & the Evolution are playing at Maag Event Hall in Zurich on 20th April 2010. Bit far off but tickets will sell fast.    
Gentleman is pretty amazing live!
		 
			
			John Butler Trio coming April 25th 2010 at Maag MusicHall AG  
unfortunately i'll be on a plane to Oz then

			Jase you just made my day!   
I love John Butler Trio, saw them live at Gurten Festival.  
Will get my tickets asap     
Another heads up:   
RJD2 is playing in Bern in May.       
			
			12 March, Zurich, Volkshaus -    bringing his upcoming   work.   
Brothers and sisters in true music, this gig is a keeper of keepers.  I have heard some tasters from the CD, read reviews from in the know people who I trust with their musical opinions, and it promises to be a deep human  , esp. in these obtuse times on the planet earth.  And believe me I have seen Pat Metheny many times (more than any other artist perhaps including Joe Zawinul in the same company) since 1978, so this is full-hearted endorsement.   
If you saw   tour of 1992, and   in 2005, then this tour has the potential to outpass these two extra dimensional gigs.  Metheny is a musician/composer/human being for our times and for all times.   
Here's a neat interview with Metheny       Is RJD2 playing his low tech hip hop stuff (ie. since we last spoke/Dead ringer) or his indie singer-songwriter stuff? cause im not so found of his new direction.   
Edit: Also keen to check out DJ Vadim on Feb 5th if anyones going
		 
			
			Jose james, Kaufleuten Zurich 10th March.

Blood Red Shoes have a new album in March and they are coming to Abart on 29th March.    
			
			Dans le sac vs Scroobius pip play at Sudpol, Luzern 28th Jan.       
For those of you who haven't heard of them before, well worth a listen.    
There are also sections of spoken word from ""Scroobius pip""        
tickets are only 30.00   
Should be a great show
		    They played at Hafenkneipe in Zürich last year.  They must like it here.

Does anyone like this band? 
I would like to meet people going to the concert?   
Cheers
		 
			
			Thanks for the James Blood Ulmer tip nice!   
I have tickets for the great Element Of Crime next week but i heard its sold out.
		 
			
			Hey people   
sorry for the last minute question, but is anyone going to the concert of Angélique Kidjo in Kaufleuten on Saturday? I'll be there with 2 friends and thought it would be a good ocassion to meet some of you     =   
All the best 
Roxana

Will let you know if I make it   .
		    will be in Zurich (Hallenstadion), on Sunday, the  .

Although it's on a Monday  , I'll definitely see her       will be in Zurich (Kaufleuten) on Tuesday, the  !   
Would love to see her... too bad that it's so far and on a Tuesday       will take place from the 7th to the 10th of April in Crans Montana (Valais).   
The program is available here:       
I've never been so far but I might go there on the Friday evening.   and   should be interesting.       I love air but not sure how much tickets are. I thought theyd be expensive because they're crazy popular in Australia
		 
			
			Btw: Does anyone know where I can get tickets to the Stall6 gigs? Im trying to find DJ Vadim tickets online but it seems to be the biggest run around
		    I think you can just email   to reserve tickets . . .
		 
			
			cheers mate
		 
			
			The Blood Arm are playing in Albani Club, Winterthur on 23rd Feb and Bar 59, Luzern 24th. I have seen this band twice in London, and they put on the most entertaining shows of any band I have ever seen.    
Go see them!   
(And if anybody is going to be driving to either one from the Grindelwald area, please let me know...)       Great!!! I'll be there...  Tickets available at:    
(40chf  )
		    Bar 59 is a cool little spot, might go check them out.     
La Roux is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, on the 7th March.
		    Damn, apparently it's sold out.  Anyone want rid of their tickets?
		    Do Kaufleuten normally have additional tickets on the door?
		    Don't know, but would like to find out.
		 
			
			More gigs I would like to go to (but need to work out if I can get back from Zurich on a school night  ):   
Hockey 16 Feb 10 Abart     
Vampire Weekend, May 28 2008   Zurich <-- so errr ignore that, as it's way out of date (Thanks bananahead for spotting!)
		     
Hey Kirsty, you do realise that it is 2010 this year?                 
But they were good    
			
			hmm thanks for pointing out my stupidity... but I would have liked to go! This was my vain search for bands I really like playing in Switzerland, and I turned up... 2   And one of those was 2 years ago! (It said past performances in teeny tiny writing - you can't blame me for getting over excited and missing that!)   
Harumph, so just hockey then...
		     
Hi there, 
You can buy them in Ticket corner,  they are 60.60 CHF general entrance, 
it is not that expensive. 
Are you going? 
Alex
		    The missus might be sorting tickets atm. Will let you know if we are
		    Hockey is ausverkauf.   
I'm not sure if they will have tickets on the door at Abart.

			Kitsuné faves Two Door Cinema Club are playing on January 27th at Ziegel au Lac.       
			
			Coming 27 Jan to the D! Club,   - the one and the only   for a  !!!!  Can not make it for professional commitments in other parts of the continent, but it promises to be da BOMBE.  Such a precocious talent.  A voice and presence        
Check out this clip from 1995 in London.  Whatever you do please stay in your seat...........!!!!!!!!!!       
			
			infected mushroom are playing feb 13 @      
they always seem to be changing style, better than being stagnant I guess, and I'll probably go check it out
		     
I thought he went by the name of Senanda Maitreye these days?   
P.S to save others searching the D Club location as I just did   it's in Lausanne
		 
			
			As a heads up, we actually have a concerts calendar as an option on the main forum calendar. It's somewhat lost because one has to scroll down and change the options to see it - we're working on simplifying this - but  anyway. As these lists get longer and longer, perhaps it'd be useful for others to know from the calendar if you're intending to go. It'll allow a bit of buzz for the event and let others know who's attending.
		     
Nicky, he sure has but thought to put his former name out to those who remember him from 1987 when he came out with  rby album, and several others after until he changed his name to Sananda Maitreya in 2001.   
My bad, I put Lausanne in the Title block but not in the main text!   
Anybody been to the D! Club in, of course, Lausanne?   
			
			Terrence Trent Darby used to be on my wall as a teenager, would love to see him if he did his hold stuff, alas Lausanne a bit too far..
		 
			
			I think I might go to this.    
Will just have to stay up all night and get the first train home  .
		 
			
			Nicky n Natasha   
I think he will play some of the older charts and newer ones too.   
Maybe he is on tour and coming to your area?  I had no idea about this Lausanne gig until I read it in   this Saturday morning.   
Or if you would like a very nice youth hostel near the lake in Lausanne here it is.  Highly recommended and very reasonably priced.  Think 39 chf room with breakfast       
			
			Recently discovered  covering concerts in Switzerland (landlockedblues). May be of interest to see who's around and get the er, skinny. (Is that right? Skinny? Is that still in?)

			Tindersticks are playing Kaufleuten, Zurich on May 5th.   
Miserable feckers. Great live.

It starts at 22.00       
			
			The White Lies gig for tonight has been cancelled.   
""Dearest fans. Charles from White Lies here. Im am so so sorry to say that we have to cancel tomorrows show in Munich and the following day in Zurich because Harry has picked up a very nasty viral infection which has destroyed his voice. He's seen doctors from various parts of Europe over the last few days and overdosed on every steroid/anti-inflamatory and pain-killer we could get hold of. But it hasn't worked and today we had to come off stage in Vienna after only 3 songs. We're so sad to have to re-schedule these two shows once again. We had been looking forward to them since December. Please be assured that we will still play these shows for you as soon as we finish the next album and by then have exclusive new songs for you. Love from us all. C W/L""

			Benga comes to Bern on the 3rd of April at Reitschule.   
Haven't yet been to a pure dubstep night, this seems like one to go for.  Might be my first night out in Bern too.

Opinion anyone?
		 
			
			Posting on behalf of a friend of mine, he organises Stoner rock bands to come over here.  Rock isn't normally my thing but I've hugely enjoyed every concert he put on.   
Locations are either Sedel or the Blues Bar, both in Luzern.  Sedel is the old womens prison, just outside of town, Blues Bar is a tiny room at the back of a latin nightclub, just past schuur.               
			
			Ash are playing Abart on 25th May     
Last time I went to see them was at the University of London Union...seem to remember the night ended up with me drinking Snakebite and Blacks, whilst arm wrestling students...not quite had a similar experience in Switzerland so far...

24-27 June, St Gallen.   
Gonna be a rough weekend!
		    Yeah . . . especially without any decent bands        
*GROAN*   
sorry DJ Bobo wasn't available, he's kinda hard to get a hold of this time of the year
		    Well, I'd probably give LCD Soundsystem the time of day . . .   
And I note that The Strokes have a new album out in 2010.   
Not the freshest line up though, is it?
		 
			
			Yeah, I'm really going for the Strokes and STP (and I have a gulity pleasure for Billy Talent too, but I'm in therapy for it).   
The rest will just be cool filler, perhaps some surprises.
		 
			
			Huge Euro festivals suck. Small festivals suck harder. It's all a big con to get us to consume more product. Bring back touring.
		    What you want is small 'conference' festivals in towns:  SXSW, Stag and Dagger, The Great Escape
		    What I want is a seven foot blond chick with natural curves and green eyes who'll turn into a pizza at 3am, but I appreciate your sentiment.
		    Certain to be available at all the above events, if you do them right.
		    Ahhh I saw Ash at the Astoria last year. It was great. I will try and get along to this one. It's a school night though    
Happy memories of ULU... They used to do the best nachos to go with your snakebite!
		 
			
			I've seen Ash 3 or 4 times at various stages of their career and they have yet to be less than awesome   Best time was in a little venue in Hastings and Silver Sun were the support.   
Ah, Silver Sun - their debut album was fantastic!!
		 
			
			Saxon - Z7 - Thursdsay night.
		 
			
			Blood Red Shoes at Abart on March 29th          Indeed           
Looking forward to it lots.
		    please tell your friend to send some of these bands to lausanne...      concert cancelled !!!
		 
			
			The Moon and Stars' festival (in Locarno) programme is available:       
Too bad that Locarno is that far!!!   
I hope that JK will give another concert elswhere in Switzerland       Would go to see LCD, STP and Wolfmo but the FREAKIN World Cup is on, priorities priorities.    
I see the Gurten has Faith No More headlining - enough said. Wont be going to see that rubbish again.
		    They'll be showing all the matches from big screens so it won't be that you'll have to miss anything....btw Mike Patton is GOD!
		    To be honest its the WorldCup, I need to be comfortable when Im watching the Greatest Show on Earth!   
Hmmm MP is a deity huh... The Real Thing is their seminal album granted, in fact I still regularly listen to it, but their material got progressively Pattonised (weird and experimental in want of actual music) culminating in the God awful Mr Bungle. Discuss...
		     
I don't know how I can discuss such ignorance politely    
Different strokes I suppose and if you prefer the Mike Patton that sings Lionel Richie covers then so be it... I guess I couldn't interest you in his work with John Zorn then       No need to be polite, we are discussing Patton after all. Angel Dust was after The Real Thing, and about the time I started to loose interest. Jizzlobber was the last straw. Terrible.
		 
			
			I for one am stoked to see FNM headlining the Gurten Festival!!!    
btw...   
epic < angel dust < king for a day < album  of the year   
tomahawk is also awesome.   
peeping tom is really good too.    
mr bungle and fantomas are acquired tastes but absolutely incredible live.
		     
what's a world cup?         
Sorry, not my thing
		    Unfortunately this world cup is not played with sticks so guess your national team didnt qualify, u could always support the USA       He does a great job, I'll post them up in events shortly, but if you'e a big fan of any of the bands, it'd worth the trip to Luzern.  Both venues are very small and you get right up close to the band.
		 
			
			Soccer world cup? I know what id rather do..... Anything. But then again I'll watch anything when im loaded   
Anyone going to this M4 music thingo tomorrow? Keen to see Jose Gonzalez again. Last time I saw him the sound was awful and it was a horrible setup
		    Jeff Beck!
		    yeah but in support of ZZ Top? ewww....      
but i will say tho that Jeff Beck was amazing at Montreux Jazz Festival a couple years ago. probably my favorite guitarist evah!    
			
			FYI Paleo Festival has announced their lineup....meh           
besides Iggy & the Stooges & Indochine... meh indeed
		    Two Door Cinema Club and We Have Band are worth seeing.   
Foals are very definitely worth seeing . . . amazing live performers.  Klaxons too.   
I'll happily dance to Vitalic and Yuksek.   
N*E*R*D pretty good live too.
		    So I can see what snazzy dressers they are? Sorry, generic ""indie"" music bores me nowadays. Good point about N.E.R.D. & Vitalic though.
		    There's a big difference between TDCC and something like Coldplay or the Kooks.  There's electronica and afro-pop in there.  Yes, they're snappy dressers, but that's part of the deal if you sign to Kitsuné.  Not sure how they'd come across on a festival stage though.
		     
Which they stole from Vampire Weekend, who stole it from Paul Simon, who stole it from Fela Kuti. Shame he's dead now...
		    . . .  who stole it from someone else in Africa . . . etc etc blah blah blah   
You think there's a chance of completely ahistoric music with no antecedents?  And that bands shouldn't use some of the same sounds and influences?  TTCM fall some way in between Vampire Weekend and Foals, but have their own sound.  Vampire Weekend are more preppy/New England.  Foals miss out the Afro-pop, but have some of the same kind of indie-dance and free range guitar.
		    meh indeed
		   26.05.2010: Foals @ Abart, Zurich  
Tickets are available from    
			
			Port O'Brien playing in Zurich, Basel and Luzern this weekend. I have seen them in Dublin before and they were great live! Recommend.   
Hopefully they will still make it despite volcano issues!
		 
			
			Stevie Wonder at Moon and Stars on 7th July.
		 
			
			Crystal Castles at rohstofflager, Zürich on the 27th April, might try and make that.
		    play the Idaplatzfest in Zurich, 21st August, showcasing their second album      Perhaps      playing this Friday night at 8pm at Kaufleuten Zurich.
		 
			
			Not sure if it's already pegged in here, but The Eels are playing in Winterthur on August 28th, supported by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  Tix are 54 CHF from Starticket.   
Also the night before, Paolo Nutini is playing the same spot.   
Looks like an open air music week in old town Winterthur, should be cool. (Events already created for both in the Concerts calendar)
		 
			
			I've created a social event in the calendar for the Tunng gig on Wednesday.
		 
			
			this looks promising:        
at least for friday night.       What is it about the Swiss and Skunk Ananse?? 
Every other country got tired of them in weeks!   
The Eels looks promising!
		     
When you figure that out please explain to me their fascination with Amy Macdonald.   
It's just Eels btw, no ""the""
		     Cool, miss living there.
		    Anyone fancy it, or already going?
		    Er . . . that was last night wasn't it?
		    May, no?   
(too short)
		    Ooops . . .  I am living in the future!     (Yes . . . there are flying cars here and everything)   
			
			This looks good, an open-air festival for Zurich at long last.  i'll be there for Underworld and Booka Shade.  I'll try for Placebo but tradition dictates I turn up right at the end of their encore...          I've posted an event for this:       
			
			Bump for the Tindersticks playing at Kaufleuten tonight. Anyone else in?
		 
			
			Jimi Tenor and Tony Allen at the Kaserne tonight (8/5/10). Tony Allen was the band leader for Fela Kuti, but his solo stuff since then is less of the traditional afrobeat. Fans of experimental rock and jazz should check it out!
		 
			
			They obviously like it here     
mo. 29.11. -  - abart
		   Mike Patton's Mondo Cane   Thursday , 29.07.2010   20h00  Luzern (CH)  KKL Luzern - Konzertsaal    
			
			A.R Rahman concert 
Hallenstadion Zurich 
16 July        thanks for posting. that would be a VERY interesting show to see.    
but it seems like most concert announcements just make me realize i'm on the wrong side of switzerland.       Foals were amazing last night.  Tracks from the second album are generally more contemplative than those from the first and therefore less appropriate for a live performance.  The old/new split was about 70/30.  It's just incredible the way the band plays together . . . precise but intensely passionate.  Many times throughout the gig I just went 'wow'.  The final song, 'One Step, Two Step' left the crowd on a high.
		 
			
			not sure if anyone has posted it yet, but Slash is touring his new album in June. He's playing X-tra on the 16th of June. Miles Kennedy is on vocal duties.   
from what i've read they are playing a healthy mix of tracks from Slashs' back catalogue and the new stuff.  i'm really looking forward to this one.           
			
			Another overlooked festival, just saw a poster for it...Neuchatel Open Air.   
Cypress Hill! Looks like a nice location too.        
			
			What about the   in Lucerne   
Shame about the name.... I think its for the sexually frustrated
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this but....      - Abart, Monday 5th July, CHF35   
Fo sho!
		    Oh how gutted i was to hear this was on the 5th July, the day i go on holiday! VERY gutted
		    damn have my mother here from Oz that week. Might take her with us    
			
			Almost missed this one, John Garcia plays Kyuss at Schuur tonight (2nd June), Luzern.
		 
			
			i'm going to see them tomorrow in lausanne. i didn't bother posting coz i really didn't think there was anyone here interested.   
should i also mention baroness is playing in fribourg in july? my new favorite band.    
			
			A band I know will be playing Thu, June 10 in Stall 6. 
African Percussions and a singer from Gambia. 
P-Train & Lamine Jobarteh.   
CHF 10.-            
			
			The Kissaway Trail the highlight (for me) of this year's For Noise festival in Pully (near Lausanne).       
			
			I'm surprised no one has mentioned Prince in Geneva on 12 July.        
			
			Not sure if this has already been mentioned   
29th Sept Hallenstadion    
I am so there!   
Tickets for ticket corner members went on sale today, general public tomorrow I think, many pre sales tickets already sold out so get up early tomorrow folks    
			
			Say what now? I thought I knew you! interwebz-wise.       stick with me Debz and i'll show you the way    
come on who can not be a Peter Gabriel fan?
		             
anyone born after 1980       Phil Collins fans?
		 
			
			anyone coming to Bsides festival today?
		 
			
			Possibly, keeping an eye on the weather.
		    Damn . . . didn't spot that.  Not sure if I can come now.   
Three Trapped Tigers are excellent.
		 
			
			Hmmmm . . . Crystal Fighters are playing at the Imagine Festival in Basel tomorrow.       
Am I right in thinking this is free?   
Anyone else going?
		     
it is free, might be going.
		 
			
			I've already booked and paid for my Guns n Roses tickets.   
Geneva, 16th September at the Arena (beside the Airport)
		 
			
			I'm probably a bit slow off the mark, but Mumford and Sons are playing (with Sophie Hunger) the Montreux JF on 14th July. Tickets are note available on the ticketcorner site but, unlike other, it is not marked as sold out on the Montreux site.   
I'm also very tempted by Julian Casablancas with Vampire Weekend but at 80.- it's a bit steep. There are tickets available for that though.   
Does anyone know where else I might be able to get tickets? I can get to Montreux to buy them next week if this is necessary...   
Merci d'avance!
		 
			
			More rock at Sedel, Luzern.   
July 2nd 
Yawning Man   
July 4th 
Mondo Generator   
July 8th 
Valient Thorr
		 
			
			Devendra Banhart is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, Tuesday July 13th. Tickets from        
			
			Its not a Swiss gig so please don't shoot me down but we are off Wed to Belgium to what I reckon is the BEST open air festival in the world.....   
Werchter Festival is so damn well organised and has a solid line up every year. Just 8 hours drive. You can't beat it peoples.   
ROCKONAUSTRALIA !!!        decent festival but Primavera destroys all
		 
			
			careful with your ears, folks.    
my last concert, john garcia plays kyuss, might be my last concert.    
since then, i have tinnitus. BAD. this sucks.    
i will post up some tinnitus info at some point but please take care of your ears.   
/sweet blog
		    Nice!  I may have to think about this... haven't had my fill of weird yet this year.    One of my all-time favorites:   
[maybe this should be in song of the day...]   
But on a Tuesday?!? Come on!   
EDIT: Anyone here planning to go?  I am so up for it but pretty sure my roomie wouldn't be interested...
		 
			
			Baby was a black sheep, baby was a whore. Baby got big but she's gonna get bigger..... Anyone going to see Patti Smith in the Rote Fabrik on Wednesday? 
I really hope she only plays old songs, but it's not too far to walk home if she does.
		 
			
			here's an 'under-the-radar' festival...in grandson VD...          Oh man, missed that and probably can't go now.   
Love this song:       
			
			It'll be outside, on the lakeside, so you could in theory, come watch the football, outside, and listen to her in the background. It's going to be quite a night! I'll be up on the roof!        I really should be but the devil on my left shoulder told me to go watch football instead.
		 
			
			Rodney Branigan at the Cava.....     
			
			anyone interested in Baroness at Bad Bonn (Düdingen), 13 July? I got some super dooper expensive earplugs to try out.        
			
			Patti was legendary. The lake was magnificent, and Germany lost. Was that the perfect night?        crap i just saw this! i love patti smith- seen her a ton of times and poetry stuff too... wish i knew i'd have definitely gone...   
i've even got a gorgeous photo of her holding my then 6month old son at a poetry event in nyc... wah. a bit sad now i need to keep up on these things...   
			
			I want to be half that cool when I'm 62!       I would have loved to have gone , but I got the feeling that you would have got the weird Patti doing performance art versions of stuff, rather than the angry Horses version ... 
If it was the later then I wish I had gone !
		    was incredible.                
			
			T'was the latter. I expected a post-menapausal, I know it all and I'm gonna pass on the word Patti, but she rocked! Right up til her final song, which was rock and roll nigga. Having said that, she didn't actually do horses.     
			
			The Coral are playing Abart on November 2nd   
Should be a really good gig and tickets are only 35CHF       
			
			Mike Patton fans- Mondo Cane will be in Lucerne the 29th at the  .

          30.11.             (usa) &    (uk)   
sif you would go to Helmet. ffs its HELMET!!!!
		     
almost word for word what a friend said to me when he saw that    
Xiu Xiu in St Gallen in November..
		 
			
			ooh, i'd like to see those Drums in action.  (is the day before my birthday too, sounds like a good excuse for a big friday night)   
i'd be interested in seeing kate nash covered in whipped cream and lip-synching too, but only for laughs             A very good excuse indeed! It would be nice to see you there ... I've got my ticket ...      Yep, I agree, only for laughs, but as I do not like the location, I most probably skip that one.
		 
			
			i have just been informed that the Scissor Sisters are playing the on the 15th of November.          HELL YEAH!    
but that's a looong drive for a tuesday night.      
holy crap! after a quick search they are playing in Yverdon on Dec 1st. STOKED!
		    hope they are better than when they were at hallenstadion, worst gig in my history of gigs and i only had to endure half of it
		    I'll buy ya a beer, so take the train    
			
			02.12.2010 gossip @ x-tra, zurich 
info:   (german)
		 
			
			I see Booker T is playing  tomorrow (21st July). Rather peeved to only spot this now, plus to have to miss it due to soccerball.
		    wish i could. you're very lucky to have the abart. when i lived in zurich, i only saw 3 concerts there (in 3 years) due to working so much and just being out of the loop. recently i went and looked at the history of who has been there since i left in 2001 and thought i was gonna be sick.    
king's x at the abart was one of my favoritist shows ever.    
			
			Here's a few gigs that might be of interest in the ""near"" future:   
Pendulum 30/09 Xtra CHF45   
Goldfrapp 05/10 Xtra CHF60   
The Coral 02/11 Abart CH37   
Carl Barat (The Libertines, Dirty Pretty Things) 09/11 Mascotte CHF46

The Drums 19/11 Abart CHF43   
Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan 26/11 Kaufleuten CHF48   
Blood Red Shoes 29/11 Abart CHF35     Sorry for any repeats!   
			
			Pendulum, oh boy, might have to get in early on that one..
		 
			
			Kap Bambino at X-Tra in Zürich this Friday!       
(not sure that's the best of venues though)
		 
			
			It's notable how many bands return to Zürich soon after playing here.  Dan mentioned Blood Red Shoes above, Beach House too.  Do they think it's cool here or is it the strong CHF?   
Here's another returner . . . Au Revoir Simone at Abart on August 23rd, they were good at Stall 6 last September.   
Other acts that may or not be returning:   
Mystery Jets at Abart on 11th October 
Yuck at Hafenkneipe on 3rd November 
Plan B at Kaufleuten on 14th November

			Don't know if it is already mentioned, but Iron & Wine is playing on the 16th of September at El Lokal, Zürich.          SO SAD I WILL MISS THAT!      Tonight the YOUNG GODS are playing for FREE!!!!

Eintritt Frei!
		    Paging Gastro Gnome...that thoroughly nice chap is playing for free    
Sadly I'll be somewhere else...   
Oh, and I assume you mean September instead of October       Funnily enough I've met Gilles a couple of times through a friend.  She was visiting London from Estonia and was a big fan of worldwide.  She went to his club and got chatting to him.  He invited her to his house the next day and sent her off with a load of vinyl . . . she went back to Tallinn and became a DJ.  Nice chap.   
Have I already told you that story before?
		     
nice lil' story which doesn't amaze me all that much. Peterson seems like such a nice bloke at least on the radio show    
I might make the drive out ... Zükunft is such a great little club with an awesome vibe and the woodblock prints for announcing the nights
		    I'm not sure you got to the vinyl bit as those pesky Foals were a playing there thingys awfully loud    
*worldwide worldwide worldwide*
		    Ah yes . . . it's all coming back to me . . .
		 
			
			Is anybody heading to Rote Fabrik on Saturday to see The Maccabees?   
It's free from what i can understand of this-        
I might be if I can get out of prior arrangements
		 
			
			Pink Floyd fans should be headed to Dietikon, ZH Saturday evening 9-18-10:          Brilliant!  Yeah . . . I'd like to go and see them.
		 
			
			03.12.10      Switzerland       Aarburg      Moonwalker

See    
			
			The Morning Benders tonight at Salzhaus Winterthur   
support is the fantastic Sheila She Loves You from Basel
		 
			
			I can't believe I just read about Maccabees now it now. 
They are pretty cool!
		    It was an excellent gig, more so for being free.  We should lobby them to return.
		 
			
			The brilliant band The Wedding Present are playing on the 31 october in the Mariaberg in Rorschach:     
...why Rorschach       And they're playing Bizarro!?!?!?!?!   
Hmmm . . . might have to look at a hotel there . . .
		    Yes might be an option.    
Not doable on public transport as the last train departing towards Zurich leaves at 22.40.   
Why don't they play at the Volkshaus in Zurich like normal bands do?  
Don't get their marketing strategy?!   But then if they ever had a marketing strategy they'd be a world famous band by now.
		    Their biggest marketing push, as far as I remember, was quite perverse and involved releasing a seven inch single for every month of 1992.  I had 'em all, but have somehow lost track of them.       too much apple pie, Tubbs           
I just checked them out - thanks for the tip - I love them!!  Shame they don't have more dates up on their calendar but I will keep an eye out.  Hope there are more bands like them around - gives me hope    
			
			Nothing beats   for finding out what's on. 
You filter by date, price, distance willing to travel, can link to other social sites etc..
		    How do I see everything in Zürich.   
It just came back with this limited selection:        Hmmm . . . I tried registering.   
Does it only show you bands you track?      I've just spent ten minutes getting nothing but frustrated with that site.  I simply want to see what's on in Zürich.  Instead it seems I have to track a load of bands.  Can't I just track Zürich?
		    Don't know if you meant Sheila she loves you or the morning benders but if it was the first they are playing in La Catrina in Zürich tmw evening for   good idea to get there a bit early though as it fills up quickly.
		    They usually play at least 3 times a year in Switz anyhow..
		    Who told you that? The Wedding Present have hardly ever played 3 times a year in Switzerland (if ever).
		    Yes - Shelia she loves you - I won't be in Switzerland until the 11th October but will checking out all the bands and venues.  Do the gigs usually finish in time to catch the last train back from Zurich to Basel?  Here in scotland there are some venues that run 7 to 10 pm and last train is about 11pm but most venues run to midnight or later.
		    Well if you're moving to Basel I'm sure you'll have plenty of chances to see them. Most venues try to finish in time for the last train but it doesn't always work out.
		    Perhaps slightly exaggerated but they do come through quite often. I know for sure they've played Sommercasino in Basel several times.
		     
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finntroll @ Konzertfabrik Z7 - Dec 12!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't know that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank the holy lord that I was browsing this thread!!!!! One of my current favorite Bands of all time... Slightly strange coincidence too.   
So um, anybody else going?    
			
			Black Rebel Motorcycle Club @ Zurich Volkshaus November 14th   
Can find it listed everywhere but can't find tickets yet...

			Nick Cave and the Grindermen will be playing at the Folkshaus next Tuesday in Zürich. Anyone else going?

Shellac is playing in Bern on the same day , a bit torn between the two.If he would be singing bad seeds songs it would be easier.
		 
			
			Tell me about it! I'm immersing myself in Grinderman, to get used to it so I won't be too confused on the day. Having said that, they may do a couple of their badseed songs.       
			
			Dollhouse (SWE) play mascotte today (tuesday)- starts around 20h and some norwegian band will open for them.
		 
			
			Karma to Burn 
Les Caves du Manoir 
Martigny   
Deftones 
Frison 
Fribourg   
Bandsintown.com is pretty cool but has some limitations. I'd like to be able to opt out specific locations (like Zurich and anything in France) and it would be cool if you could feed it a list of bands from your music collection. Aside from that a nice utility. A friend told me about something similar that works with your itunes collections, feeds your band names into a database and returns upcoming concerts for bands in your collection plus similar bands.
		    How was the show?      Thank you!   
27th October @            
			
			Not sure if its been mentioned but a band from my home town in Australia are playing on Nov 5. Really Psychedelic but pretty decent the only time ive seen them    
Tame Impala 
Nov 5 @ Mascotte, Zurich
		 
			
			Club night rather than gig: Nu:Tone (Hospital Records)* & Stamina MC are playing at Kaserne, Basel on Sat 23rd Oct:    
Will be heading over from Zurich, anyone else going?   
* UK Drum and Bass producer and DJ
		 
			
			A bit disapointing to be honest. Maybe it was just too early in the tour. Some of it worked, some of it was a disaster. Nick was looking alot like Bunny Munroe.        Hmm. I saw him in Liverpool once; someone shouted ""C'mon Phil Collins"" and he never recovered. To think he let Kylie slip from his arms...
		 
			
			I don't want to talk about         I've met stamina at a house party once. Hes a cool dude. I could make it out for this one. I love hospital artists
		 
			
			Anyone going to see Santana tonight? My old man (who is a good laugh) is going by himself and he probaly wouldn't mind meeting up with some fellow old skool fans.       Anyone going to the Deftones show in Fribourg?  Has anyone been to that venu; is it large, small etc?  Thanks!
		    depending on which hall they use it can hold anywhere from 300 to about 3000 people. Considering it's the Deftones I'd imagine it would be the larger one. Frison is one of the best concert venues in Switz imo. One drawback to it though is that if you're in Basel or ZH it's often difficult to get back home with the train if you wanna stay till the end of the concert.
		    i'm going!    
i saw mastodon there last spring and i enjoyed it but have to say the acoustics there are pretty bad. there are certain spots where the reverberations from the big walls will turn the music into a horrible constant roar. a few feet to the left or right and it's ok again. also, there are no elevated viewing areas (all just a big floor) so if you are on the short side it might not be ideal. otherwise, i like the old warehouse style of venue.
		    Hmm, well i'd be comming from Basel so i guess i should start to look for someone with a car (if anyone is going anway?) or try and find a place to stay.  I wish there were better concert venues in Basel!  Thanks for the info!
		     
a friend of mine might be going with a car. Ask me when the time comes.
		    Cool, I'll prob catch the train over in the eve, let me know if you want to meet up.
		 
			
			Saw sharon jones and the dap kings last night @ kaufleuten and they were amazing. Invited two of my mates and they also raved about the show.   
First time ive been to kaufleuten too. Really cool venue. Might be a little posh for me though    
			
			Anyone going to see   on Friday?  Let me know, I'm going with another lady friend by train from Zurich hb.
		 
			
			The excellent Bonobo is playing a few dates in Switzerland 
Les Docks, Lausanne on 8/12 
Moods, Zurich on 17/12

Or only CHF33 from Starticket
		    Ooh! Ooh!  I would totally join for Seu Jorge! But I'll be out of town.  
Ah well, next time. 
Let me know how the show is; never seen him live and most of the albums I love of his are *quite* a few years old.
		    Check out his  stuff!  
If you haven't already seen the LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU you must.
		    Balls. Im back home for Xmas. Bonobo is dooooooope
		 
			
			is there anyone interested in two free tickets to KARMA TO BURN playing in Martigny on Nov 3rd? i can't go now due to other plans. i hate to see good tickets go to waste...PM me if interested.
		     
Decent band and nice guys. I would take those tickets off you if only 1) I knew where Martigny was, and 2) David Max and the Sons of Void weren't playing in Basel and Spectrum weren't playing in Basel on the same night.
		 
			
			i was all set to drive an hour to martigny to see them, bought 2 tickets for me and a friend, then later discovered that i had mistaken the date and have another concert (public enemy) on the same night. then to top it off, they booked another show in yverdon on the next night, which is even closer than martigny. i'm planning to go to that one.        
Thank you so much for your post!   
I am definitely going to Seu Jorge's concert! 
Is anyone from Basel joining too?!
		 
			
			Moorcheeba with Skye (26th) in Zurich  
Sounds great, anyone going?
		 
			
			The Black Keys will be performing @ Rote Fabrik next March.

Anyway . . . looks like there's a good thing happening this weekend at Uto Kulm.  That's three legendary DJs!          Cheers for that, to confirm 24th March CHF35....Linky    
Sweet    
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned   as a gig guide/general stuff to do resource...just happened to see a copy of it on the tram this morning and it's a pretty comprehensive       Indeed.  I'm not sure if it's entirely comprehensive though.   
The @zueritipp Twitter feed is laughable.
		 
			
			ooooooH!!!!

			Went there for the first time last night to see Caribou and Shy Child - what a fantastic dive it is ! I miss the toilet venues in London (Dublin Castle, Windmill, Notting Hill Arts Club and so on) and this place would not look out of place if it was in a side street off Oxford Street.   
Recommended if you like down and dirty venues and interesting up and coming bands.   
Shy Child totally kicked bottom. I enjoyed Caribou but after half an hour felt I had enjoyed them sufficiently.   
Coming up - Beach House, The Swans, A Place To Bury Strangers and in January The Fall   
Pay on the door, no advance booking, no credit cards. Like stepping back to the seventies but in a GOOD way.           
Ive been hearing her songs in the local Migros a lot actually. Maybe they have her album or that she's gaining a little notoriety in Switzerland?
		 
			
			of course, in response to this....  i have to offer up the original.  I was never a massive Chisel fan, before my time, but I know every word to this one.                     Only the two in Zurich...but at the Xavier Rudd on 21st and Panteon Rococo on 24th (also in abart)

			Hi all, there is a gig tonight with someone called Jess who is the lead singer - i met a guy from the band on the plane today - but he didnt know where it was! anyone any clue how I can find out where it is? I'vee googled everything I can think of and cant find anything with a Jess singing.

			Hey Pol, what is Komplex?             Hey Nic. Komplex is a new location (Hohlstrasse 457, Zurich - next to Letzipark). From what I've heard it is bigger than Abart and a good alternative ....
		    Strangely at the same address as Dollhouse  . Could make for some interesting shows.
		    So I look on their website and pop up a post. And then the next day I get a newsletter saying that it's not Zurich but Luzern.

			If any of youse are keen on your blues, C.W. Stoneking is playing @ El Lokal, Zurich on the 27th Feb.    
His version of seven nation army on TripleJ a few years ago was a think of beauty. Id post it but its block out of Australia    
			
			Ah, I can't believe I missed Lambchop. And Mark Lanegan, that hurts. And Einsturz. And New Model Army, they are still playing? Wowsies...I should really watch this thread.
		 
			
			Also I saw K&D are playing at Volkshaus on Jan 29th. Im super double mega pumped to see this if anyone's keen for a catch up
		    just got informed that johen arbeit will not be be playing after all      UPDATE VOM 07.01.2011: Leider musste Jochen  Arbeit die Tour aus familiären Gründen absagen. Brian Mitchell wird aber  im Café Kairo eine Solo-Show spielen.      Love love love C.W. Stoneking!   He will also be playing at ISC in Bern on 17th of Feb - this has just made my day.

			<3 the Cold War Kids! Thanks for the heads up on this show!      I've been living in Boston for two years now, and will be moving to Basel in a couple of months. The Dropkick Murphys put on a great show!
		 
			
			Thanks for the heads up...I saw them in Manchester many moons ago, and unfortunately they really did come off as a two/three song band. Still might be worth a watch in a small venue like the Abart.          When will you be in Basel?  If you want to meet up and have a chat or see a show drop me a line    Always nice to meet someone comming from Boston.
		    Sounds like a good show.  I will probably join.  Anyone else going?  Is this venu easy to get to from the main station?
		    Hi JustRose,       (from the Bahnhofquai/HB tramstop)  direction Albisgütli and get off at the Sihlcity Nord stop or you can catch the S4 Train (from track 1 at the Zürich HB) and get off at the Gieshubel stop. Both stops are walking distance.       Looks like the Black Keys have cancelled    
On the plus side Mogwai will play Rote Fabrik on Friday 11th March, tickets CHF35.    
			
			Some others I have seen on Zueritipp:

			I'm definitely going to catch the Foo Fighters at Greenfield this year. The teaser for new sound songs great (well at least the first 30 seconds). Sounds more like their older stuff.     
			
			my favourite song of the foo fighters is "" my hero"", followed by ""the pretender"" and ""wheels"". 
Looking forward to the festival........
		 
			
			I can't make it to Greenfield this year as ill be away so am planning to go to Southside festival (in southern germany) instead.  Anyone been to southside in past years?  It looks like a really great lineup this year: 
Foo Fighters * Blink-182 * Arcade Fire * The Chemical Brothers *Portishead * Arctic Monkeys * Clueso * The Hives * The Subways * Gogol Bordello * Flogging Molly * Elbow * The Wombats * Sublime With Rome * Two Door Cinema Club * Boysetsfire * Selig * Band Of Horses * The Sounds * Klaxons * Eels * Sick Of It All * Parkway Drive * William Fitzsimmons * I Am Kloot * Friendly Fires * Darwin Deez * Converge * Comeback Kid * Portugal. The Man * Kvelertak * You Me At Six * Brother * Cloud Control...

		    I saw them tonight in Bexhill and they were excellent.  It was the last night of their UK tour before coming over to mainland Europe.  If there are any returned tickets I would definitely recommend it.
		 
			
			The line up for the m4music festival (24.-26.03.2011) is finally out:

		    I saw 'Does it Offend you , Yeah?' in London a couple of years ago.  Quite underwhelming though.    
I'm not a huge Streets fan, but this is a must see as it will be the final tour ever.
		    I'll be there! Anyone else?

			Bright Eyes are playing Kaufleuten in June - got mine on Starticket yesterday.
		 
			
			YUCK is playing on March 7th in the Hafenkneipe in Zürich:       
			
			Ever since we moved to basel in October we have been on the hunt for local unsigned indie bands in cool small venues.  So far we have been to 2 gigs - both great but we are used to 2 or 3 a week!!!  Seems the venues are here but not always our genre of music (too heavy or hip-hop etc..)  so after waiting patiently - we have 2 gigs next weekend!! And all Swiss bands!!   
Friday the 25th at Kuppel for the Choo Choo's of Bern and the Kapoolas from Basel   
Saturday the 26th for Basel's own: Shelia She Loves You and the Oh' No's (two of the bands we've already seen) at the Union Kultur Club.   
Along with seeing the Charivari on Monday night (to see the Top Secret Drummers) its gonna be a good week!!!!
		 
			
			^ Sheila She Loves You are fab - their last gig at la Catrina in ZH last year was my fave gig of the whole year. I hope they make it back to ZH sometime soon!
		 
			
			Queens of the Stone Age   
At Komplex 457   
on 11th May
		     YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!                Gimme....where?
		 
			
			In basel try out 
Nordstern 
Hirshnek 
NT areal
		    Cheers for the heads up. Just bagged me some tickets      The one venue we really liked was Sommer Casino - they do a lot of rock, metal as well as hip/hop.  Only a couple indie nights over the last few months.  Also look at the Kaserne - this is right near us and looks fab from the outside but nothing on their calendar really appeals to us.
		    I have to yet find heavy and actually interesting here, but it is not like I venture out much for this, we live in a tiny place...so gota give it real chance. The stuff I have heard was either to eager to be heavy, leaving everything else behind, or noise for the sake of noise, but I am sure there is something worth listening.
		 
			
			queens of the stone age will also be at this year's kilby at bad bonn!!!! can't wait to find out the rest of the lineup!           Just some info on tix: tickets go on sale this  , limited to 4 per person, from either        
or        
Tix are expected to sell out fast, so get in quick!
		 
			
			After lots of wondering why there had been no news, I was sad to hear today that there will be no Zurich Open Air Festival this year   - last year's line-up was so awesome.   
BUT   
it is confirmed for 2012. Yay!       
			
			Bad Kilbi Bonn's a great festival, great atmosphere and generally good bands there. I saw the legendary Sunn o))) there a couple of years ago.
		     :d
		    And they are now sold out.
		 
			
			The Sadies @ El Lokal May 29 ... Also playing the Stolze Open Air Festival Zurich on May 28th     
cheers, 
Sue
		    ahem      
Anyway. She was fantastic.   
It was my first time at Komplex. And it's tiny. I was expecting somewhere a bit bigger than abart but I think it's actually smaller. Although it does have a higher ceiling which helps with the sound.
		    Smaller than Abart?!  Mmkay, explains why QOTSA sold out so quickly.
		    I'm sad that I missed her      
The Komplex venue can be rearranged for bigger shows. The walls are all moveable - actually it's a huge space. That's why it can accommodate bigger acts like QOTSA, My Chemical Romance, Interpol etc etc as well as the smaller ones (Phoenix Foundation, Caitlin Rose) I think the capacity is up to 5000.
		 
			
			Looks like British Sea Power have cancelled their March European tour,  including the Abart gig on the 09.03.11.    
Not sure why....but Noble cracked a rib at the last gig. Bummer!   
Gigs will hopefuly be re-scheduled for later in 2011.
		    Yep, it is planned to be re-scheduled ... or at least that is the plan so far. Fingers crossed!       I used to love Belle and Sebastian until I saw them at Open Air last year, they were pretty lame.    
			
			Haha, got sucked in and forgot what I came on here originally to post    
Anyone else going to Roger Waters this summer? I am already looking forward to it!! I just can't wait haha    
			
			I am going! can't wait       I bought The Boy With The Arab Strap when it first came out on vinyl but never really got into it. Then late last year I bought the latest and love it. Since then I have bought all of the CD's so I hope I'm not disappointed but I think they will be better indoors than out. And it should have a totally different vibe to a festival.
		 
			
			alexander hacke from einstuerzende neubauten will play in dampfzentrale in bern on 12th march!

José is a world renowned guitarist, born in Brazil but living in Nyon. He used to teach at the Geneva conservatoire, and has appeared many times at The Paleo and Montreux Jazz festivals. A brilliant artist.
		    When you think they started as a college project, they've come far from the days of playing King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow.   
I've seen them a few times and they always deliver, but can get a little twee. At one show at the Rote Fabrik they covered Dire Straits' Romeo and Juliet. Hmm. Since Isobel Campbell left, so did the darker elements. Still worth seeing though    
			
			Atari Teenage Riot are playing @ Salzhaus, Winterthur 21.05.2011:

Ohhh! ... and Beady Eye are playing at Gurten Festival. Excellent!  
(Other annoucements for Gurten: The Ting Tings, Kate Nash & Royal Republic)
		 
			
			Noise fans,  is playing tomorrow (sun March 6th, 9pm), in Geneva, at  .    
I was curious myself, saw this performer from New Zeland 3 days ago in Prague and he blew my mind. Plus, he is a really cool dude, high school prof on his sabatical touring the world with his musical mission. He is quite big in his field, so far on this tour he has played in UK, Scandinavia, CZ, FR, after CH he is going to Japan. Just a note for the gentle souls amongst us, bring ear plugs (just in case the sound guy sucks  ).    
It's short and sweet, very intense and a ton of dizzy fun. We are going.
		     
Wow...just checked out the Gurtenfestival...many bands I like! 
I think I'll go to see The Sctrip and PLan B on July 16th.

Shoegaze-y, girl-group-y pop, garage rock-y, grunge-y goodness.
		 
			
			Yes please.           that sounds really good, shame I missed it.
		 
			
			Lloyd Cole small ensemble 13th April at Restaurant Viadukt.
		    Actually, it was awesome....The Geneva performance better than in Prague, then, Cave 12 threw a gig yesterday -  and  also quite obscure noise, I am sorry I have missed those 2.    
But, were very lucky to have Campbell Kneale of  on our couch past few days, weeheee...a lot of interesting talk.    
Check out Cave12 in Geneva, it's a fantastic project, loads of gigs are in  , an experimental culture place, I think it used to be a squat, unsurprisingly. I love the venue, nice people, guests and staff. Cave12 are great, too. Very approachable, I want to gig with them, when we finally put sh...t together.

2 Day music festival in Basel - April 1st and 2nd. Figures we are in scotland that weekend for a 2 day music festival in Edinburgh but anyone else looking for live music (indie, etc...) in little venues should consider going!!   
I've been to a couple of the venues and they were great (summer casino, kaserne) and have seen The Kapoolas and really liked them.   
Oh and Shelia she loves you!!  Very good local Basel band!
		 
			
			I've got the following gigs lined up: the human league, swans and qotsa at the bad kilbi bonn festival, earth, cyndi lauper, marianne faithful, belle and sebastian but I'm most looking forward to seeing Earth

jun 24th 
3 doors down will play at jun 14th at the volkshaus zurich
		 
			
			lyle Lovett plays at kaufleuten jul 17th, good charlotte plays at komplex 457 
aug 04th
		 
			
			Flexing my urban muscle, Frauenfeld 2011:   
Snoop Dogg, Lil Wayne, Cypress Hill, Wyclef Jean, The Roots, Taio Cruz, Ice Cube, Black Star (Mos Def and Talib Kweli), M.O.P, Public Enemy....to name a few.   
Sounds like a hot ticket
		 
			
			for the same customers(frauenfeld) is the festival in wohlen (Touch the air), june 23th to 26th with timabland, akon, ludacris, busta rhymes to name a few     
			
			British band The Brew playing the Galery Music Bar near Z7 in Pratteln tomorrow night        Yes that looks a great line-up. Underworld are amazing live, and been wanting to see 2ManyDJs live for a long time. 
I'll hopefully be able to spend the whole weekend there.     
And for this weekend (Sat 2nd April): Kings Of The Jungle @ Komplex Zürich:        
			
			Another reminder for my mates awesome Rock'nRoll April events at Sedel, Luzern, stoner/pysch/desert/doom rock.   Different concerts on the 3rd, 8th, 21st(22nd is a holiday btw, so you can stay out late) and the 23rd of April, see   for details.       
Sedel is a great venue for these bands, I just wish it was a little closer to town.  Shuttle busses do run every half hour I think and only cost a tip for the driver.
		 
			
			Also, just seen   and   are playing Stall 6 in Zurich on the 2nd of April.  Loving whatever that scene is, electronic hip hop beats, monster bass and synths.  Their albums are well worth a listen if you don't mind a bit of the electronic).   
Edit : FFS, Young Gods play Sedel on the same night, and it's a friends birthday, damn.
		 
			
			The line-up for the Palèo Festival has just been announced - The National, PJ Harvey, Portishead, Beirut, The Strokes, Anna Calvi, The Chemical Brothers and more...               
			
			Filter at Abart on 22 June       there are some fine acts playing there but mainly during the week and I've got to work!    
			
			Best thing about Paleo, for me, has always been the discovery of acts I would've never seen otherwise...  &   come to mind in recent memory
		 
			
			Don't forget! Belle and Sebastian @ X-Tra ZH next Wednesday 13.04.11 Perfect indie pop - herbaceous borders, foxes, cups of tea etc etc            
Filter are phenomenal live, I saw them at a festival when Richard Patrick got nailed in the head with waterbottle. Didn't miss a beat right at the corus of 'Hey Man Nice Shot'.   
Crowd went berzerk! Sick mosh pit. I never knew 'Take a Picture' could be such a heavy song.   
Gonna hit up this show up for sure.
		 
			
			José González & The Göteborg String Theory are playing tomorrow (Friday 8th April) at Salzhaus Winterthur.       
Anyone else going as well?
		   Ben Howard is playing at the Caribana Festival in Crans-près-Céligny on 11th June:           Has anyone been to this small Festival?   
			
			Just got an e-mail with the BlueBalls Luzern lineups;

Could be up for Sophie Hunger, CocoRosie and Joanna Newsom out of those but the rest seems a far cry from Imelda May and the Dandy Warhols last year...
		 
			
			Can anyone recommend a gig for tomorrow (Saturday) night in Zurich?   
I feel like some music        
Concert is tonight. Should be really good       
			
			Dirty Dozen Brass Band from New Orleans plays at Moods tomorrow.  I'll be there.
		 
			
			Tuesday July 5th    - X-tra     
			
			I heard that next thursday Beardyman is playing @ Stall6 for around 20CHF. If you get the chance check out his essential mix from this year (or last..... can't remember...). Basically beat-box's the entire thing while looping over himself beat-boxing.    
Its like the musical form of Inception
		 
			
			Slash plays JUL 13th at the KOmplex 
Rise Against plays Aug 23rd at the xtra 
Josh Groban plays at the KKL Luzern Oct 06 th

			Architecture in Helsinki playing Kaserne in Basel on Easter Sunday night.

Already have my tickets for friday.             How was it? I wanted to go but didn't want to put up with the pain of getting back to Zürich - I had things to do on Saturday.
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this before but Raul Midon will be playing in Zurich at Moods on 10th May. Tickets available   priced at CHF38.   
This guy is brilliant        
			
			Atari Teenage Riot are playing at Salzhaus, Winterthur, 21.05.11           
Minus a member, right?
		    Yeah there's just 3 of them on tour - Alec Empire, Nic Endo, and MC CX KiDTRONiK, I think. Carl Crack OD'd in 2001.
		 
			
			Sheffield band   are playing @ Stall 6, ZH next Wednesday 18.05.11         (ps. I've got some free tix if anyone wants them, check the 'Free Stuff' section)   
			
			Holy Sh!t!   
Wilco are coming to Basel on 7th November - playing the Kaserne   
Also the Wild Beasts are playing on the river in Basel on 11th August.   
Awesome!!!
		 
			
			Cat's Eyes (Faris Badwan of The Horrors, and Canadian opera singer Rachel Zeffira) are playing at Hafenkneipe, ZH, on Thursday 26.05.11, kind of dark girl group pop with goth undertones. Watch their debut performance at the Vatican (of all places!):       
			
			anyone else going to einstürzende neubauten tomorrow and on thursday in lausanne? i'm SO looking forward to it! if i manage to get there in time that is...   
			
			A while away yet, but awesome Kiwi band   are playing at Abart, ZH, Thurs. 08 September 2011. I saw them at the m4m festival this year and they almost blew the roof off Exil.
		 
			
			Cut Copy + Architecture in Helsinki @ Stall 6, ZH, 28.06.11 - so I will get to see AiH this year after all    
			
			Grandmaster Flash at Stall 6, Zürich, Saturday May 28, 22.00
		    Getting back home was the expected long, drawn-out, sleepy saga, but it was worth it. Cinema-gig with the band sitting on stage in front of the screen, ripping into their instruments, while videos played behind, it was pretty unique. The band hung around before and after and had beers with the masses too, nice blokes.
		 
			
			DJ Shadow at Komplex Zurich on 04.06   
and Arcade Fire at Montreux Jazz Festival on 10th July!!          I try and go every year, will be there all 4 days this time. If you like old school 90s hip hop they usually have a big name one evening or another. The rest is either French Pop / Reggae (so many hippies in NE) / usually decent electro and some kids singer on the Sunday afternoon which is when the families are there.    
  It was really crowded last year, I hope it'll be better organised (more bars, less VIP space) so getting drinks doesn't take half an hour. There's load of benches and what not so sit down on and it's by the lakeside so you can smoke by the rocks if you want. Thing of it as a Fete Des Vendanges you have to pay an entrance to and that has decent music. Well worth it... so long as it doesn't rain too much, but most of the place is covered by tents anyway.
		 
			
			Too bad I am not here!  
The  in Winterthur (15 min by train from Zürich!) is on in June, they have concerts from June 10-12th.               
ENJOY         playing Zürich 30th June
		 
			
			Anyone wanna join me in the Rote Fabrik to see Slim Cessna's Auto Club. Some band members from 16 Horsepower, in the theme of American folkrock, kinda.       
			
			Simian Mobile Disco playing Nordstern in Basel on Friday night and Cut Copy playing Hinterhof on 29th. Really looking forward to both.
		 
			
			CEREMONY is playing on the 28th of july in Dynamo in Zürich:       
Together with: 
LA DISPUTE 
TOUCHE AMORE 
DEATH IS NOT GLAMOROUS
		 
			
			...and still far ahead, but KVELERTAK is playing in the Abart in Zürich on the 1st of december:       
Together with:   
TOXIC HOLOCAUST 
TRAP THEM 
WOLVES LIKE US
		 
			
			Destroyer is playing Rote Fabrik on the 24th of June. His last album out-80s the 80s, and if the live show is anywhere near as batshit-bizarre as this video, it should be interesting.       
			
			Lenny Kravitz  at the Hallenstadion Nov.26 th  
Flogging Molly at the Komplex 457 Nov.17 th 
The Kooks at Komplex 457 Oct.26 th
		 
			
			the Cat Empire are playing at Komplex on the 12th November (tix on sale on the 29th June)
		    Yes - did I miss it?     
Can't believe I've only just found this thread    
			
			Just got back from seeing Filter at Abart. It was AWESOME! It's quite surreal seeing bands that I grew up listening to.  Back in the Republic of South Africa, it's a dream come true to see bands like this.  I'm very grateful to be able to have these experiences and see these band that I admire and really love.
		 
			
			Sebadoh at Abart in Zürich on August the 15th. Grungey!       
			
			Just happened to notice Fleet Foxes are playing at Komplex 457 on 21.11...some way off yet I know! As much as I like their albums I'm not sure about seeing them live - anyone seen them before?
		 
			
			^ I haven't seen Fleet Foxes before, but I'll be there.   
also, awesome aussies cloud control are playing at hafenkneipe 19.09.11. great band, lovely people.
		    Not quite my thing but very good live, I've heard.
		 
			
			Switzerland has its fair share of good gigs!!!      always has a good line up.   
And the Red Hot Chili Peppers are playing in Zurich before they even come to the UK!!!! Dec 13th at Hallenstadion!
		 
			
			The Dub Pistols are playing in Fribourg tomorrow night, 2nd July, as part of Fribourg Jazz Parade. Don't really know much about them, but sound right up my street.          Generally regarded as having given a very weak performance at Glasto last weekend.
		 
			
			Manic Street Preachers are playing at the Winterthurer Musikfestwochen on Sunday 28.08.11:          @ Plaza, ZH, 01.11.11. Tickets  .
		 
			
			11.10.2011 - Beady Eye @ Volkshaus, Zurich 
Tickets are going on sale tomorrow ( )
		 
			
			Not Zürich but definately worth the trip - The Antlers play St. Gallen 3rd December.
		 
			
			Some bands work much better in a venue then at a festival. Actually most bands do.       
			
			Hi we're just moving down from Lux in Sept and in the past few weeks have seen Foals, PJ Harvey - Prince played here etc etc. There is a good music scene here and it's advertised of 2 main websites, is that the case in Zurich or Switz as a rule? 
Thanks
		    Arse - back in the UK then. The last album was a corker .... back to the old form
		    Sunday August 14 - Zofingen - Heitere Open Air Festival
		    It's ok. There's a lot of bands that don't come. As Far as I'm aware PJ and Foals have never been.
		    PJ plays Paleo I believe, this weekend. And I'll miss her       Tickets available on ricardo if you want them.    
I'm just going to pretend that I meant Zürich.
		    Nope ... Foals played at Abart last year. Zurich is not that bad after all       I didn't say i was bad, just ok! I'll revise my opinion when Radiohead come and play on their next tour.
		    damn, only one Swiss date??    
Will you be seeing them on the UK leg of their tour DP?
		    I am going to see them in Hastings.  Just a few minutes walk from my house

PRINCE!!       
There are no more standing tickets left from ^ that ticket link, but I found mine from a UK website
		 
			
			The concert from prince in cologne arena was absolut rubbish, he played 
one song, left the stage for 50 mins, returned for anonther 65 mins and left 
early after a total of 75 mins played, some people payed about 150 euros for a seat.         That's a shame. He's usually one of the best live acts out there (imo) 
I hope he'll not be doing the same in Zurich
		 
			
			Friendly Fires will definitely be worth a look....   
Sadly I won't be able to make it - but I recommend   (Abart, 8th Sept)

Saw them a couple of years ago at that very spot.  Was very, very loud, we got very drunk, one mate got into a fight in the mosh pit and was almost thrown out, another ended up sleeping under a mattress in a squat somewhere in Zurich.

It scans your iTunes library or you can quickly and easily choose the interests that interest you as well as the cities and you have a personalized calendar and receive emails when concerts of interest are announced.

			Not so much a Heads-up, more of an ""Oh Bollocks"", but did anyone catch the Buzzcocks in Aarau last Saturday? Any good? I missed it as I was in the UK.        Saw them last year when the played Zug OpenAir (free festival) it was nice to say I'd seen them but tbh they were nothing special at all.

			For all you Vaud jazzers,   is coming to Chorus, Lausanne, 15 October 201, with his Migration band.  This is a musician/drummer not to be missed if you can make the gig.  Reservations will be necessary, I am sure.   
Antonio has many projects, but those of you in the know will recognize him as Pat Metheny's drummer in his PMG (Pat Metheny Group), the drummer since 2003.       
This is a big musician coming to Lausanne.

			Blue October are coming to Z-7 in Pratteln BL on 19 November.  I saw them once in Boston and it was a good show.  Too bad i am not in Basel then to see them again.

			Perhaps this could be interesting for some people: the people from the Kilbi festival in Düdingen/Bad Bonn will launch something like a   in winter - 9th/10th December in Exil (and Moods) Zurich.   
Particularly looking forward to Glenn Branca Ensemble and Thurston Moore. It's a little pricey (85.- for both days), though it's worth it for me.
		    presents  .   
The concert will be held on  at  , at   in Burgweg 7, 4058 Basel.   
You can buy tickets for 24 CHF through  ,  , at SBB and Post. Or you can buy it at the venue for 26 CHF from 21h on the night of the gig.   
The concert itself starts at 22h, but there will be a party at around midnight with DJ Edin and DJ Bob Rock playing Balkan/electro music.   
Kultur Shock plays some sort of Balkan music/rock/metal/punk fusion, and they are particularly good live. Well see for yourselves:       
and the same track live at exitfest 2010 in Novi Sad, Serbia:       
Great huh?! }:-) 
See you there!
		 
			
			Don't forget: British Sea Power are playing at the Abart, ZH this Wednesday 12.10.11. They had to cancel their ZH show twice before, so fingers crossed they'll make it this time!           
			
			pretty much my reaction too, with an few choice expletives thrown in though. I did regain my composure long enough to selflessly post it here, thinking it might help some deserving music fan out that way catch them.          Good concert, though I was pretty drunk. Place seemed to empty by the end of the gig, shame really, but as their last album was their worst so far then I'm not surprised.
		 
			
			Just got my Tickets for   at Stall 6, 6th November.

			Saharan blues from Tinariwen at Kaufleuten in Zurich on Saturday 15th October. If you've not heard them live and like riddim then it's the concert for you. A major influence on so many records recently.   
I happen to have two tickets for this show for sale at cost price  .       
			
			Has it sold out? I was considering it but won't decide until Saturday. I'll post again on sat just in case you haven't sold them.
		 
			
			Glasgow-based band   are playing at Papiersaal, ZH, on Wednesday 19.10.11. I'm liking them a lot lately, and I reckon they'll be great:         (I've also got some free tix if anyone wants them: http://wp.me/pLHpb-1i4)   
			
			The Italian electro-rock band   is visiting Basel.   
The gig is starting at 21h on 30th of October in Grenzwert bar (Rheingasse 3, in Kleinbasel).      to their profile with more of their work.   
And a small glimpse on what you might expecting a few weeks:     
So if you feel like changing your Swiss routine, you can start by going out on Sunday evenings as well. }:-)   
See you there!

		    We rarely read reviews after the event on this thread, so I'll keep it brief: It was very good   Support act François & The Atlas Mountains had some interesting beats but strange, Eno-esque dance moves, which were a bit theatrical, but in all very West Coast French dance melancholia. Anna Calvi's voice is a joy to hear. Nuff said.   
Oh Hai GastroGnome! I tried to grab ya but you had more beauties surrounding you than I did, so I didn't want to steal your thunder       I was there too! I'll be writing a review soon (on my blog, though, will post a link), just haven't had a moment. We should do a meet up at the next suitable gig, what do you think?

			A bumper week for music in ZH next week! Obviously getting to all of them may involve some kind of cloning technology   but here are my tips:       
			
			I'd love to say The Kills were great last night, but due to the   sound at X-tra, it's hard to say.    
Not the first time either - I'm not going to waste my hard earned on that venue anymore.
		     Were you upstairs or downstairs?   
I find if you are right in the middle upstairs the sound is not so bad.

			Sisters of mercy (chf 55) and its at xtra in zurich. Date 23rd November 2011   
I've got a spare ticket for the above   
If you're interested please pm me
		 
			
			looking forward for the sisters of mercy tomorrow and on thursday! can't believe i have never seen them before!    
next days' schedule:     
tomorrow: work, drive to zürich, gig, drive back 
thursday: train to lausanne, work, gig, sleep 
friday: drive back, work 
saturday: drive to zürich, vive la fete gig 
sunday: drive back, probably spend day on sofa 
monday: work, drive to zürich, fakir's gig, drive back ?   
why do all the bands chose to play at the same time and almost never in bern??
		    I was bang in the middle, about a foot behind the sound desk. Logically I would have thought the best place for sound in the venue...       yes,that is normally the best spot  . Try upstairs next time if you can.
		    price negotiable, if anyone is interested
		    mhm, the last time when there was paul kalkbrenner, sound was fine?!  
same with belle & sebastian and morcheeba.
		 
			
			sisters of mercy gig at the xtra was pretty good but the sound quality was terrible, more due to xtra than the sisters. not the first time a gig has been ruined for me at the xtra due to useless sound quality
		 
			
			Right, don0t know what the problem there is. The second half of the gig was much better.          Skindred are an awesome band - saw them at Download a couple of years back.  DK Murphies are a must see too - saw them in boston last year.
		 
			
			anyone going to any of these?   
the horrors - tomorrow night 
smashing pumpkins - next fri 2nd dec 
dEUS - next sat 3rd dec 
thurston moore - sat after 10th dec   
im new to town (zurich) but will be headinbg to these gigs, so feel free to say hi!   
(especially if you know where i can buy vimto...)
		 
			
			I'll be at the Horrors tonight, gimme a shout if you want to meet up. I know of a few Asian stores in Oerlikon which sell Vimeo that I can give you directions for ^^
		 
			
			sounds good       i'll most probably be at the dEUS one! and also at dEUS in neuchatel on the 6th     
thurston moore, i thought i was going but it's on the same date as FAQ's gig in Aarau   
and i think i'm probably going there, as the partying will surely be better!    
i had some friends seeing smashing pumpkins in london a few weeks ago and they were very disappointed (and they are pretty big fans). so i'm not going (to be fair, i wouldn't go anyway as i'm not crazy about them)   
we seem to like similar music, so feel free to come and say hi tomorrow at Fakir's show in kaffi für dich (details a few posts above).
		 
			
			Hi Crimson, I'll see I will see about monday night, tho i tend to work late at the moment. I'll def be at dEUS tho, my fav band! That should be ace. it woul dbe good to go to the show on the 6th as well but, work!   
Shame to hear your friends didnt like the pumpkins recently, i had friends at copenhagen, manchester and london gigs and they were nothing but loving the shows. they are the band that usually suprise me most at shows with how amazing they are, but i shall see!
		 
			
			i hope you will enjoy the sp show! let us know!    
dEUS are perfect. every time i see them i can't get over how great they are. and they are not even my favourite band! (but amongst the top ones anyway)

The Musical Box is a highly professional canadian Genesis tribute band. They bring the early Genesis years - when Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett were still in the band - back to life. They recreate their vintage shows as original as possible. The sounds, the sights, the costumes, the lights, the everything. They are very approved by the original band. Phil Collins even played a show or two with them. This time they will play the ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"" show in its entirety. It's rumoured that original Genesis guitarist   will join them for the encores!

while I had my head in the books studying for exams I forgot to do something very important (buy Noel Gallagher tickets at Komplex 457). Now they have sold out and I am kicking myself(!). If anyone has 2 spare tickets that they would like to sell or knows of a way that I can legally acquire said tickets, I would be most appreciative    
cheers

			woo.     play Zurich's Volkshaus 7th March. From CHF55.-     play 13th March in Zurich's Kaufleuten. From CHF50.-      play 16th March in Zurich's Kaufleuten. From CHF50.-     
hoo.   
CHF300.- gone. just. like. that.                  I've got tickets for wilco, earth, bruce springsteen and mastodon. I am thinking of seeing the tindersticks (brilliant in geneva in 2010, good in zurich in 2011) and lambchop. I saw lambchop a few years ago in the rote fabrik and they were dreadful, the band was sloppy, the crowd got bored and people started to go home. they must have had a fight because there was lots of banter between them which didn't involve the audience. this was promoting the damaged album.
		    I was at that gig: it was US Independence Day. Talking backstage with them during the interval Kurt and MacManus were talking about being TourBlind: it was getting tired and no longer personal. They wanted to be with their families, especially on that night. After a peace pipe, they came back on and played some haunting stuff, which many didn't enjoy, as you note. The banter was down to, er, the pipe, me thinks.   
Crap jokes were still crap, though. Can't wait to see them again.
		 
			
			for any Radiohead fans out there..    
I just got an alert on Facebook saying Radiohead tickets go on sale tomorrow  (31january) for a performance at Montreux 09 July
		 
			
			I got mine   who else will be there?          thanks that explains it, I have been thinking about that gig for years wondering why such a fine band had such a night
		    Gah! Thanksgiving. It was November. Don't know my foreign national holidays.

Glass Swords is one of the best albums of last year, though TBH, the appeal may not be immediately obvious.
		    Thanks for this old advice Jimmy Bee! I did not make the concert last year but went tonight to see him at Moods, he was playing with his Primitive Horn Orchestra...       Yes, brilliant music. But their concerts should be black and white.
		    Haha! So true....      - are you sure you are ""working"" out of the country for three months? Pretty sure me and Prof T saw you playing the drums last night in the Primitive Orchestra!

			Hi everyone, I'm new to this forum, so please bear with me, at least for a while. I was thinking to create a group on Meetup for people that go to concerts in Zurich, and perhaps want to go with someone else or bigger crowd.Would anyone be interested to join?    
I'm thinking (next few months) :   
26.03 Damien Jurado (el Local) 
31.03 Olafur Arnalds (moods) 
02.04 Veronica Falls (Mascotte) 
28.04 Bowerbirds (el Local) 
29.04 Laura Gibson (el Local) 
06.06 Tortoise (moods)   
If sth like that already exist let me know of course, i might have missed it.
		    Sounds like a good idea, this thread isn't a good way of organising social events.

Headliners on August 24th:     Franz Ferdinand   
Headliners on August 26th:     Flogging Molly     
			
			The   lineup is pretty damn good, especially the Saturday: Afghan Whigs, Mudhoney, and Lee Ranaldo.      Canadians Unit!      is playing at Parterre in Basel on April 7th!   
For anyone who hasn't heard this Canadian gem, they are highly acclaimed and having seen them in concert back in Manitoba, they are amazing live.           Hello and welcome to the Forum. You can post concert events on the mysteriously invisible*   or under   ( if you're a promoter or financially involved).   
Putting a concert / event on the calendar gives it greater exposure and allows for some 'buzz' (is this what the kids call it these days?).   
Also, you can set up a  . This particular thread can be hard work to get overview, so lead from the front!   
*Must look into why it doesn't show under the Events icon    
			
			this is a 'wee bit early but if there are any Diana Krall fans out there she will be playing Lucerne in November ( she just sent me an email to let me know )    
and hopefully there will be a couple more Swiss dates showing up.       
			
			AND.............   
any Pink Martini fans... ??    
they  (+/- China Forbes ? ) will be performing at the Verbier Festival 01August    
( tickets for this and all Verbier festival events just went on sale at noontime today )           
( EDIT... got my tickets confirmed.. row two seats 38-40.... just off center ... hope the people in the front row don''t wear frou-frou hats )

I'll check if I am free then - I would love to see them again.       Thanks for the heads up Prof. That weekend looks good for me so far, same as above, will check and see.    
Reggae...   
			
			The Concerts calendar is now added to the Events menu - thanks Editor Bob.    
As it's tricky getting overview of posts made in this thread perhaps consider adding a concert to the concerts calendar if you intend going as this may encourage others and it'll build our social opportunities.    
Lambchop play Kaufleuten in Zurich tonight. As I'm not attending - sad - I won't post it on the calendar, but were I to be going...   
Keep on rockin' in the free world.
		 
			
			I tried to add the concert to concert calendar but it says :   , you do not have permission to access this page."" 
where do i get the permission ?   
			
			As I understand it you need to make ten posts beforehand although it's such a dusty corner of the Forum I'm not sure. Have another try once your post count reaches 10...

			MAZZY STAR is playing in the Rote Fabrik in Zürich on the 18th of July         MOD EDIT: Nickelback thread merged   
I have never met an actual fan of this band.   
I'm sure they have some, but are probably too embarrassed to admit it. I don't blame them.
		   They've sold over 50 million albums, allegedly
		 
			
			I've been wanting to see Mazzy Star for years but alas I'm on holiday that day!
		 
			
			the song about the panties down by the ankles is cringeworthy
		    The same fans that think Bon Jovi are a great ""heavy metal band"" or ""Survivor"" and ""Europe"" kick ass.*           (*Um, they don't ....)   
			
			here's a great video with all the wikipedia 'updates' on Nickelback over the years.     
Some are very informative and amusing            
I guess I'll be dancing alone then           Canada has enough awesome music.    
Nickelback is just the Canadian reaction to Creed.

( I'm not overwhelmed personally )
		 
			
			Looking forward to RPWL at the Galery Music Bar in Pratteln this evening:       
Although the Z-7 crew are promoting and selling tickets, the venue is the Galery just down the road, not the Z-7 black hall.   
RPWL started life as a Pink Floyd covers band, but they've had their own progressive style for more than a decade now, their latest CD ""Beyond Man and Time"" is very good melodic rock.
		    I'd go just to see Janelle Monae. She's amazing
		    I like the line-up but can't understand why it's called Montreux ""Jazz"". Been to Cully last weekend, much jazzier there and a fantastic atmosphere.
		 
			
			Would love to see Tony Bennett but tickets are very expensive
		    I guess it's kind of hard to change the name midride.... and much of nowadays music is influenced by jazz (the good stuff at least)
		 
			
			Eagles of Death Metal are playing in Solothurn on the 21st of June.           
Nothing remarkably new or mindblowingly good, but never fail to entertain live. I'd go just to see Jesse Hughes do his little dance.
		 
			
			I have a spare ticket for ""The Slackers"" (SKA), Thursday April 26th, Zürich, Dynamo. Please PM me if you want it, it'll only cost a beer.

Saw him a few years ago at the wonderful bastion of downtown bohemia El Lokal, but almost fell asleep. He has a massive following but somehow he's lost his bite.    
Chicks dig him though, so see you there.
		    Definitely a victim of his own prolificacy.   
He is my beard mentor though, I'll be heading along for some ad hoc trimming tips.
		    MOLOTOV will also play in Winterthur, Salzhaus,

Tickets are on sale at   for a WHOPPING 78,60 plus the print at home fee makes it an 80 CHF ticket... I don't get why they charge us to print out the ticket at home.. that should be free right?   
			
			Quite a treat: starting on Friday, 16th November at the Reitschule in Bern is the   festival, celebrating 15 years of Constellation Records. Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Do Make Say Think, and A Silver Mt. Zion, amongst others.       Godspeed also in Zürich's Rote Fabrik for 35chf    
Can't wait! Although I've never seen them live so I have no idea what to expect...

			The Tindersticks ( ) and the Maccabees ( ) are playing in Fri-Son in November. Don't realy know a great deal about either band, but will have a butchers at YouTube and might pop along to one or the other.   
Edit: Sorry, had wrong dates.
		          The Tindersticks are a brilliant band, check out their second album with this cover (   and Curtains:   
The music is melancholic, moody, orchestral   
They can be brilliant live especially when they have their string and horn sections in tow.   
I fully recommmend them and good luck!
		    Thanks for the heads-up on this @Crumbs.  Can't wait!    
			
			What is it with the XTRA venue in Zürich?The sound quality is truly dreadful. I have seen several live bands there and I have always noticed the poor sound quality. Only the supremely organized or very loud acts seem to be able to overcome the poor sound quality of this venue.
		 
			
			Thanks PaddyG, I've been wanting to see the Maccabees for years :-). Seen Tindersticks, not really my bag.

			I've got tickets for Fleetwood Mac on 13-10-2013 at the (wretched) Hallenstadion in Zurich and I'm really excited about seeing Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie and the two lucky guys
		    There have been rumours about (no pun intended  ) that Christine McVie may also appear on the tour
		    I'm glad to hear it but I thought she'd retired completely, she really has to sing her songs, Stevie Nicks has too country a voice to sing Christine's songs imho. I'm also really looking forward to seeing Buckingham, a seriously underrated guitarist, play

They are appearing at Z7 in Pratteln on May 9th.     
This as a trailer to their debut album 'Dimensionaut'.  It should appeal to all prog. rock fans.          Thanks for the heads up. Saw them last night at the Stadthalle in Sursee. It was just like it would be to see the real Pink Floyd playing in a high school basketball gym. Fantastic!

		    They play at Komplex in Zürich tomorrow.

I'm finally going to get to see one of my favourite bands!    
			
			Nouvelle Vague play Kaserne in Basel on 2nd October. I have my tickets :-)           
btw what did you think of the gig? I wasn't impressed, I saw her last year in Geneva and she way way better
		    strange, i was also last year in geneva and did not enjoy it very much. i thought she was in a bad mood, whereas in zürich she was in a good mood   
i really liked the one in zürich and the one in montreux a couple of weeks later. still have the songs in my head. gotta love her.
		    i'm going as well! and to another place they're playing, could it be geneva? (yes too lazy to check)    
i've seen them live a few times already and i'm always impressed by the energy they bring on stage. much better than the cds in my opinion. you will love it!
		    Oh! I thought I might be the only one from here that would be interested. Maybe with the exception of Prof T.   
I saw Red Sky Coven a few years ago, but haven't managed NMA yet. Really looking forward to it.
		    exciting, isn't it?   see you there!    
			
			Fat Freddy's Drop, in Zurich 21st October       
will buy tix soon
		    god they were incredibily shit live 3 years ago at the kaufleuten. they sound like a local schoolband doing covers, far from their fab CD productions.

			I'm hoping for a fun night out rather musical masterpieces.        
			
			For country fans, Band Perry will be in concert in Zurich at   on the 23rd of November.  Warm-up acts (not listed here) are:  Easton Corbin and a a dynamite guitar player from Canada, Lindsay Ell (her mentor was Randy Bachman of BTO).
		 
			
			I don't get the nouvelle vague love, for me its money for old rope.
		    well, some versions have a bit of fresh new paint to it or sound interesting though i am not a big fan. just got a ticket from a friend, so i just 'been there'. what i like about them is the nice singing voice of the girl that wasnt there at kaufleuten and therefor (sorry, lou) were rather like a fly buzzing around my head...
		 
			
			vive la fete are playing in bern this coming saturday. woop!        
			
			Hi guys, been lucky enough to follow some of the greatest bands around just before they ""made it"" (luck and friends, not me). Went to see this Swiss band absolutely amazing and a brilliant punctuation to my move to Sydney. I think Domi should be big and I mean BIG       This got good around the five minute mark.  Sounds like what would happen if you put Thom Yorke and the XX in the same room.
		    Really cool music but my god what a shocking voice. They really need a new singer...        You have a good point...Not everyone can be this guy:       
			
			Anyone going to see Lucero on September 18?
		    I gotta see her live one of these days, can't believe I have missed her so many times. Did she do Nude on the News?
		    nope, unfortunately! according to my catpower expert boyfriend (and kind of friend of hers) she refuses to play it
		    I can't have too much of her all the time, a bit too dramatic but Nude on the News is one of my all time favs, really. She is so spontaneous and talented. I hung with folks who went to see her a lot in Atlanta.
		    i cannot have too much of her at once as well. but i like her more and more as the years go by
		 
			
			So I went to see Nouvelle Vague on Wednesday night, the sound quality of the band was not so good but the singing was perfectly fine and the entertainment factor was excellent. Over all a great night out and a lot of fun; I would go and see them again.           maybe because her song is called Nude as the News... see! Catpower loves me more than you!    
			
			After skipping out on most of the festival scene this summer, I'm excited to see The Dirty Head and the iconic Sublime (with Rome) on Nov. 12 at Haerterei. Great show for those who enjoy the punk/ska/reggae cali scene.           
			
			Rude Zone Festival at Dynamo, Zurich, November 1st:     
with BAD MANNERS and RED SOUL COMMUNITY, ++support           
			
			Sea Sick Steve @ Komplex on the 2nd Nov. is gonna be great.    
			
			Has a spare ticket for Sea Sick on Saturday, worth 38.- will sell for 30.- send me a PM.
		 
			
			I'm going to the following shows in Zurich; if anyone wants to join on the end then you're more than welcome to get the first beers in.     play the Viadukt Bogen F; Thursday 7th November, 21:00, CHF35.-          (Sold Out but worth a visit for the Abend Kasse option) @ Rote Fabrik Friday 8th November, supported by Zurich group  ; well worth an early arrival. CHF28.-          plays Exil, Thurs. 14th Nov, CHF25.-         play the Rote Fabrik, 20:30, Thurs 21st Nov. CHF30.-        play the Rote Fabrik, Weds 20th Nov. 20:30 CHF25.- - an absolute snip!          plays the Rote Fabrik, Thurs. 5th. Dec 20:30 CHF25.-

Thee Oh Sees 
Sleaford Mods 
Thurston Moore 
DJ Marcelle   
In a village. Who's coming?
		    Bad bonn kilbi is the best featival ever! In the middle of nowhere....highly recommended! I cannot go this year (getting married that weekend) but i cannot stress enough what a cool festival it is! 
Ps: if you go make sure to walk to the nearby lake and enjoy the beauty of thr scenery
		     
oh wow The Black Angels too! AND Mac Demarco!
		 
			
			Just seen the line up for Monteux Jazz 2015 and I don't think there is any artist that particularly stands out.  Perhaps they are keeping the best for next year as it will be the 50th one       
			
			thanks for the heads up, some good acts playing like Ibeyi, Foxygen, The Staves, Portishead, Sophie Hunger, Lionel Richie, Kronos Quartet, James Blake, Sly and Robbie, Anna Calvi, Alt J, Santana, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, George Benson,  etc etc   
but some serious crap as well, there is very little quality control going on these days
		 
			
			i'd also recommend dEUS and asaf avidan
		    I missed this, I love the Sleaford Mods!   
Otherwise a weak line up. I saw Thurston Moore with Sonic Youth at BKB a few years ago and they were lame. Highlight were the mighty Sunn O)))   
@crimson, I fully agree BKB is a great festival with a great vibe
		 
			
			Thurston Moore solo, I would go see. It is different, especially if he is in the mood.    
dEus is amazing. And James Blake.    
I want to see all that       Thurston Moore has different moods? How can one tell?
		    The left corner of his lips is about 2mm above the right one?

			recommended gigs in the VERY NEAR future (May) for Zurich:   
16.05: Dandy Warhols, Plaza (think of White Stripes with more fun)     
27.05: Porches, Klaus (from NYC - great fun)     
28.05: Dead Meadow, Club Zukunft (superb psych/garage band)     
29.05: Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Mascotte (surely no need to introduce them?)        anyway, they are a good band - very indie, if they come round again worth the trip.
		 
			
			Ezra Furman plays in Zurich tonight at Bogen F, 21:00.
		   play in Zurich at the  , 8th February.        
			
			I love them. ""Up with People"".   
Ezra Furman and his ""My Zero"" is MiniMC's ultimately fav song.
		    Doh! its the Missus's Birthday, oh well, I will just say its a surprise       Lambchop play Geneva the night before the Zurich gig; they play Luzern the night after.    
Ezra was ok the other night but the crowd seemed more happy to be there than enjoy being there, but that's the Swiss concert experience. He seemed tired.
		    I find that infuriating, in Zürich its about being seen at a concert but with absolutely no interest in the music! I am always telling people to stfu especially during quieter songs, when it seems the gig becomes a social gathering. The amount of times I have heard performers saying something about that during a performance, I don't think the Zürich audience gets it!    
			
			sooooo true....
		 
			
			Great thread. Any hint of U2 coming back...sadly passed us by last time (from a fans point of view that is).
		    It will be better when people start caring more for content than form. Being seen may also translate as liking the music, privately, you cannot expect a discrete culture all of a sudden show authentic affection in a prestigeous environment. The fact that the musicians and loads of listeners do not consider it prestigeous (the partisan opposite) is irrelevant.    
Les Grottes are great; in GE. Anti prestigeous. Weird enough stuff.
		    Lead from the front: dancing and enjoying yourself is the perfect way to get your square metre of space and will encourage the others. I was, however, told off by a woman once at a Nicolas Jaar gig for dancing. I apologised and told her next time I wanted to have fun I'd stay at home and listen on my headphones. Some just can't abide happiness in others.
		     
Hahahah. I am used to lead from the stage   , the best kind of hedonistic leadership.    
Well - I agree with you. There are places that support actual fun. And I also think that people do not dance for the same reason other stuff doesn't get done here, worried about spontaneity/authenticity being perceived as impolite, rude.    
I dance when I feel like it. Gigs, classrooms, balet halls, tents. I think the stiffness will change. A buddy of mine went to headphones party (4 diff music channels), she had to look for somebody dancing to the same stuff. Fun. And some rooms had no light. Gasp! Puritanism is on its way out of life.

Greenday - November 8th Hallenstadion.
		 
			
			Well here goes....    
For chitter and chatter about gigs up and coming to run along side the wonderfully implemented calendar events and for the numpty simpletons like me who prefer the old fashioned way      
hopefully this will replace Jot's great 'Zurich Gig Guide' from the past - but will please all the unfortunate bumpkins that live outside the canton of Zurich    
			
			Why is it that some people have so much difficulty dealing with change?   
IMO This thread is pointless and selfish.
		 
			
			I was sure I was going to get groans for that and they will all be from people living in or around Zürich...   
When in real life a small group of people sharing the same interests (for example Zürich inhabitants, blondes, Audi TT owners, whatever...) joins up with a bigger group (for example Switzerland inhabitants, ladies who like to dye their hair, Audi owners...), you can then tell them a 1000 times that it doesn't make sense them staying together in their small group, that they should open up to the other people...If they don't want to change they won't.
		    well then go to this   instead? we cater for all    
			
			Primal Scream Xtra 16 th August.
		    Are you going Annie and Nicky? We may have to re-arrange my schedule a bit so we can go because they are good live.
		 
			
			We are Nigel, booked our tickets today.
		    Not sure yet - not listened to any of their recent stuff
		 
			
			The latest album is really good. Check out the website    
We now have tickets as well.       
I am also wondering about the Delilahs at Kaufleuten on 13th August.
		    Don't you think that there are Primal Scream fans living outside of Zurich?
		    Primal Scream are playing in Zurich therefore it is a 'Zurich Gig' - I created another thread to post gigs in Switzerland should anyone wish to....
		    Grrr.... 
Zurich is in Switzerland.
		    Why don't we have ""Yawn"" button as well as Thanks & Groan?
		 
			
			Well you all found this thread about Primal Scream playing in Zurich so whats the fuss.      PS I dont live in Zurich Kanton.      I found it because I actually live in Zurich and am registered to this thread.   
But why should a Primal Scream fan who does not live in Zurich have to wade through 10 pages of Zurich concerts to discover that his favourite band is going to play in Switzerland?   
If you want to keep this thread fair enough but please also add the events to the Concerts Calendar!
		    Who let you in? Anyways, this thread is far more pointless and selfish, it's only for Zurich Stadt       True but we should also have a ""This poster is being selfish"" button that would be worth 10 groans.
		    Why register to something that seems to cause you so much angst    
Anyone only using this ""Heads Up"" thread or the EF concert guide is going to miss out on plenty of things they might like anyway. It contains a mere fraction of what is going on. Compare it to a comprehensive gig guide eg   ,   etc   
Real gig guides exists elsewhere, so I certainly can't be bothered replicating them on EF. Call me selfish if you must, but it only caters for those who like to be.....       
			
			We have the Concert Calendar, we also have the Zurich Gig Guide thread and the Switzerland Gig Guide thread - is this not enough?    
Martin if you want to add Primal Scream into the calendar then go ahead - Mannie Organ decided to post it here and that is entirely her choice but it does not stop you creating an event   
After the demise of the Zurich gig guide some people (me included) missed having a general thread to chat about and mention up and coming gigs.   
I am sure people living elsewhere can still look at at this thread if they see a new post added to it - especially if they are interested in music and are willing to travel - if someone decided to create a Basel Gig Guide I would follow it, just because i Live in Zurich doesn't mean i wouldn't be interested in gigs in other cities   
where's the flogging a dead horse icon for this bleedin topic......
		 
			
			Martin - you groaned Mannie Organ for merely posting a gig that is happening in Zurich in the Zurich Gigs ""heads Up"" thread, do you really believe that deserves a groan? as far as she is aware she is posting in the right place... really some people.....
		    The difference between the EF concerts calendar and a general events website is that the concerts mentioned on here are focused towards the expat community.    
According to your reasoning if information that was already available on the Internet should not be added to the EF then there wouldn't be much content on the EF.   
What I don't understand is why you can't create a Primal Scream Concert thread on the calendar for the 16th August and then have your discussion there: ""Are you going?"", ""No I am going on holiday"", ""Pity because Primal Scream are good"" etc... ?
		    Go for it Martin, very happy for you to go and post the event in the calendar, jeeze I'll do it if it will make you happy?
		    No I groaned at her because she knows of a good concert that could interest other expats but decided not to add it to the Calendar.
		    everytime this thread gets bumped to the top, i think there's a new concert...       I posted it in the Zurich thread because the bloody concert is in Zurich,end of story.          Most of the gigs I go to are with Swiss people. They have remarkably the same taste in music as ""expats"". EF is intended to be a ""Community portal for English-speaking people in Switzerland"", not an expat ghetto.      People do often refer to outside web sources. The real value of EF is in the info that isn't so easy to find, and peoples experience and opinions.      I've not been overwhelmed by the volume of your contributions to this calendar (was it zero or nil?). It's a bit rich to be handing out tit-for-tat groans to contributors and using that as an excuse.
		    That is the whole point of my groan. If you post your comments and information somewhere in the middle of a gigantic Zurich Concerts thread it will not be easy to find.
		     gigantic one and a bit pages.
		    Exactly the problem, and not exactly unexpected.  That is why I wonder why there are mutliple gig threads.  It serves no purpose other than to keep those in Zurich happy and the rest of the board uninformed.
		 
			
			I give up.      see everyone uses things differently, I prefer this way rather than the concerts calendar, the gig is posted and then if no one adds a comment to that event then it gets lost in the pile - whereas I see a new gig added to this and it appears in 'new posts', if i decide i want to go to the event mentioned I put it in my own calendar, I find this solution easier, however i appreciate that you don't, we can't please everyone and I think it will just have to be give and take   
If in the future you see a gig mentioned on this or the other thread and you want to create an event in the concerts calendar then go ahead but don't groan at people if they have chosen this method if that's what THEY prefer   
Nicky
		    For the moment but by August it would theoretically be longer.
		    It's a conspiracy for sure.   
Magnolia Electric Co.  25 Sept  El Lokal , Z*****
		    And why not post it to the general concerts thread?  Do you specificaly not want others to know about it?  Or do you feel too many concerts go on in the rest of the country that it would be lost?
		    Cyrus I didn't post it in here but I actually advised Mannie Organ to post it in here so yes slapped wrist - but it is actually a Zurich concert, not exclusive to Zurichers but it is happening in Zurich - the thread exists and it seemed a suitable place   
I think you are being a bit pedantic over this... is it really all that important? a gig is happening in Zurich and it was posted in the Zurich Gigs 'Heads Up' thread       It is pedantic, but it's not just me being pedantic is it?  I just feel everyone is better of with a general concert thread, but those from Zurich can't seem to post their concerts to a thread that doesn't have the word ""Zurich"" in it.
		    I think 'those' from Zurich can (if they want) Mannie Organ isn't even bloody from Zurich she posted it here because the event is IN Zurich, quite a logical decision do you not think, when confronted with 2 threads, one called Switzerland Gig Guide and the other Zurich Gigs ""heads up""    
Basically don't blame the messenger, it's the mods decision what to do with the two threads and so far they have been left as they are, so...... a user comes along and posts a zurich gig in the zurich gig thread and she gets groaned and hassled about it       
			
			Ok, to summarise:   
There was a Zurich Concerts thread, people weren't happy and made a General concerts thread. Then people weren't happy because gigs in their area were getting lost in the big General concerts thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... People still weren't happy so there was a Concerts forum created.    
People still weren't happy because they could only discuss a particular concert in a thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... then the non Zurich people got pissed off...     
FFS people, no one is going to be happy all the time. Its not the end of the world, get off your high horses (Did Hsiang ever find out where to procure one?) and go to whatever concerts you want to. If a gig is in Zurich why can't the people that live in Zurich discuss it in a Zurich based thread. If they were going to go to a gig in Luzern I'm sure they wouldn't object to it being in a Luzern gigs thread.    
I think a certain amount of ""cop the f**K on"" is needed here.
		    Actually the old Zurich concert threads served well for all concerts in the country, because most concerts happen in Zurich, there were no other threads.  I thought a title change would be appropriate to reflect the actual content of the thread, but obviously, that was just too much.
		    Well then you should have left well enough alone and not tried to fix what was not broken.       But why on earth do you guys have to have these general threads why not simply create an individual thread for each concert and discuss the specifics there.   
That was Nathu's aim when he created the Concerts calendar.   
This reminds of procedural language programmers who couldn't understand object-oriented programming: Now every concert is one object.
		    Because maybe they don't want to!   
You are still perfectly entitled to post the concert in the concerts thread should you so desire.
		 
			
			It's annoying me now how I bang on about it, I understand how some people prefer a single thread and some like the events, but I simply cannot understand why we have 2 seperate stickies simply confusing the issue.     
All gigs posted here will be in Switzerland, most will be in Zurich, why is it so hard to not have a single thread with a title that accurately reflects the contents ""Upcoming Concerts"" or some such, then acts will be picked up by all who might not otherwise consider a trip out of town.  Instead we have 2 threads, or one thread with an inaccurate title.
		 
			
			Now that 50% of the dissenters have annoyed themselves, can we move to the next part of this thread cycle please?   
Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism -> thread users discuss thread -> long period of silence -> thread users think it safe -> Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism ->
		 
			
			Er, I support the use of the Concerts Calendar - which should be merged with the main calendar IMO; let's have a huge 'What's On' section with overview - rather than having lots of different threads.   
There was some arcane rule about not posting an event on the calendar if you weren't intending to attend; surely that's not necessary? Should there be a concert, is it not easier to have it on the calendar? One concert has no relevence to any other and threads like this spin outta control... although something is better than nothing.   
And it's Zürchers, not Zürichers       Oh yes, above it all aren't we? but can't possibly post to a concerts thread without Zurich being in the title.
		 
			
			right i have to dash off to catch a flight very shortly but as an interim would it make everyone happy if I merge this thread with the Switzerland Gig Guide thread and just have the one thread from now on    
The Zurich guide i really don't think was created intentionally to p!ss off Cyrus and Martin but it seems to have done anyway and I think they'll be banging on about it until the cows come home, so I'll merge and we'll just have one generic thread - which will eliminate their the 'them and us' belief   
Agreed?
		 
			
			Right threads merged - it's all a bit of a jumble - i will attempt to edit it when i get chance
		 
			
			I was going to post earlier, but it felt a little childish   
For fans of electro pop, the excellent   are coming to CH   
Stall 6, Zurich, 2/6 and 
Volkshaus, Basel on 3/6
		    Can I now be picky and ask for it to be renamed ""Switzerland Gigs ""Heads Up"" or ""Switzerland Gigs Discussion"" or ""Switzerland Rough Gig Guide""? Cos it aint a gig guide.
		    ah it could have gone in the other thread    
			
			eskimo joe(super aussie band) are playing Bier Huebli in Bern on the 27th October.             
I'm going. anyone from Zurich feel like grabbing a train to Bern check them out?   
(to avoid a sh!t fight based re: the usual argument: Zurich vs rest of the known universe, if someone feels like popping this on the gig-calendar please feel free. i don't know how. :-) )   
they will also be at Gurten for those who are going   
cheers

			Heard a rumour the amazing Not The Sensational Alex Harvey Band will play in ETH StuZ this September. Not to be missed!
		 
			
			MUSE playing the Hallenstadion in Zurich - Nov 18th... 
Tickets on sale as of today       You've made my day!
		 
			
			B*llocks only seating left!!
		 
			
			Yeah, I think that its because you were only allowed to buy the tickets when they were released if you were a VIP member of ticketcorner.com. Totally sucks as now all the 'ticket dregs' are left. Anyhow, I managed to buy 2 tickets for the UK so will be seeing them there.    
			
			Someone wants to come?           
Thats gonna be my first concert here! Great start    
			
			I wouldn't mind going to see Gossip tonight at Kaufleuten, but they sold out at starticket, does anyone know if they sell tickets on the door?   
I don't want to travel all the way to Zurich and find I can't get in.
		 
			
			A bit short notice but, tonight I can completely recommend both of the bands that will be playing in the restaurant, if it rains, or just outside on the terrace if it doesn't, at the Rote Fabrik. The bands are, in no particular order, Sein and Attwenga. 
Thankyou for your time.

			Wilco play the Volkshaus on November 11th, tickets from CHF55.-   
Peaches plays 8th September, from CHF55.-   
Goran Bregovic also plays there 23rd April, 2010 ( ) from CHF65.-
		    play the Club at the Theater Spektakel in Zürich Tuesday 18th August, bringing some spooky Ethiopean jazz grooves to the shores of the lake of Zurich. If you weren't in Addis Ababa before 1974, you'll know their music from the Jim Jarmusch film 'Broken Flowers'    
Fire        
			
			This used to work much better when it was a single thread called Zurich Gig Guide 2009 in social events.                      play the Mascotte in Zurich again on December 5th. They're also supporting Muse at the Hallenstadion on November 18th. A good show       It doesn't work because you aren't using the system correctly.
		 
			
			Martin he is using the system how he would like to use it - please quit with groans because someone disagrees with you.   
There are many who no longer benefit from the new system me included - I know a lot of time and effort went into creating the concerts calendar but i feel it is not as effective as the handy gig guide thread we had before. I am finding out about less gigs now because people are just not posting them. It's quick and easy to post on here and many people are short of time and don't wish to create an event.   
So please, we know you don't like this method, but we don't like the other method so can we be grown up and not groan the users who would like to carry on down this route?   
Bannahead thanks for those 3 updates - I am sure in the old system these would have been announced sooner so I hope there are still tickets left for Temper Trap   
Cheers  
Nicky
		    ...It's not that we don't wish to creat an event, but we're following previous rules asking us not to create events if we don't intend / sure if we're going. This is a ""Heads Up"" thread.   
On that note, the rather loud and rocking  play the Rote Fabrik this coming Sunday 20th. Last time they played there were about 7 people in the Ziegel; one was a waiter, one at the bar, two groupies and me and my two mates   A private party!    
There're really quite good, despite the crowds...
		    I agree UM this is why i don't use this calendar event because a) I am unsociable and don't want a crowd tagging along with me at a gig   and b) sometimes I find out about a gig want to tell others but may not be going myself   
I just don't want to get into the whole gigs head up guide v concerts calendar debate again - there was no happy outcome the last time so why can't each person just do as they wish and post a gig ho they want?    
I like this method and it worked for many years and was updated regularly - at least 2 to 3 times a week a new gig would be posted on here and it was always my most favourote thread, it's now died a death and it's a shame    
			
			I haven't posted because I haven't seen anything I liked, it's been quiet over summer.   
Here's a couple to get the thread started again.   
25.10 Micachu and the Shapes / The Invisibles, Zukunft, Zurich   
12.11 Passion Pit, Alte Borse, Zurich   
20.11 The Field, Palace, St. Gallen   
25.11 Massive Attack, Eishalle Deutweg Winterthur   
3.12 Punks Jump Up, Hive, Zurich   
5.12 The Heavy, Palace, St. Gallen
		 
			
			Massive Attack, even antisocial me might be interested in that.       And where do I fit in to that description? I'm still fearful of crossing paths with the FOTL boys after the death look they gave me for buying a bottle of wine at the counter, it was for DaveA I tells ya! Don't think we'll see the likes of a FOTL & Black Mountain ""restaurant"" gig again soon   
Anyways here is my heads up, El Lokal to the rescue in October with varying shades of classy Americana in one hell of a week:   
Oct 18 - Mark Eitzel (American Music Club) 
Oct 22 - Joseph Arthur (last time I saw him was supporting R.E.M.) 
Oct 25 - Richmond Fontaine (Uncut Magazine's favourite story tellers)
		    Oh boy oh boy, Good work, El Lokal       Palace in St Gallen is a very good venue. Dont be scared to stand in front of the ""seat"" people though.        This is your opinion. And you are wrong.   
Along with Nicky, I do not want to reopen the whole Zurich Gig Guide versus Calendar discussion because it got boring very quickly. However, I will not be posting any events         
Sadly I won't be able to attend The XX gig and I am mightily disappointed.
		     
I like the recent albums but I'm not sure how it will work live.

This evening Girls are playing at Exil.   
They have an interesting personal history, having grown up in the Children of God cult, being heavily involved with drugs and being adopted by a billionaire . . . or something.   
The music is psychedelic, influenced by the Beach Boys and shoegaze.
		 
			
			Who are the ""Girls"" ?     
as you can imagine, googling is pointless ... what do I google? Girls in Zurich, Girls group, Girls music ...
		 
			
			Anyone interested in seeing Alice In Chains in Fribourg start of december?   
A bit of a different band from their Grunge days, could be interesting
		    Well I did explain a little bit in my original post . . .   
More here:          If only I noticed earlier      
The debut album - imaginatively titled Album - is in the post   
Did you go? Were they good?       
And now for a plug          Unfortunately they started at 11.30 which was a bit late for a school night, so I decided against it.   
In other news . . . Patrick Wolf is playing at Mascotte on Wednesday. Anyone going? Or want to go? If you are it would be nice to meet up . . . PM me.       
			
			FYI - for any Aussies out there Eskimo Joe is playing tonight in Bern at the Bier Huebli           
cheers

			It would seem that The Joy Formidable are supporting The Temper Trap.   
Check out the video here      
How can you not love this band.
		 
			
			for the U2 fans out there, heard that they'll be playing in zurich next summer... can anyone confirm?
		   I'm looking forward to see KING AUTOMATIC at the longstreet bar 4.11.09 @2100h
Now that is something worth going to see..       I watched their video, what a bunch of w@nkers!
		    Not definitively but I can say the stage diagrams /architect plans have been drawn up (see  ), permission for a concert at Dubendorf Airfield has been granted, and I would expect a concert date sometime in the first half of September 2010 to be announced in the next week or two.
		 
			
			...are playing at the Volkhaus on 28.01.10...(I know I know, that's ages away, but being in CH...)   
I think tickets are around CHF50 , but you'll get excellent riffage for your frank, and the support is sure to be good....       
You know it makes sense!
		 
			
			Looking forward to the Temper trap in a few weeks. Got a few mates coming. Anyone interested in meeting up, PM me
		 
			
			Ian Brown is playing at Abart in Zurich on the 18th January. Tickets are now available.   
Should be a great gig if he manages to keep out of trouble with the dibble between now and then.
		 
			
			I just hope that he doesn't get bottled like  the last time he played Rohstofflager.   
Ian went offstage for a break, the roadies were switching out the Fender guitars and bringing the Gretsches onstage. This suggests the likelihood of an encore filled with Stone Roses songs. He wasn't offstage for more than 3 minutes and the idiots behind started throwing filled cups of beer towards the stage, coating us in the front row and the instruments on stage. They were asked to stop, but the continued. The lights came on the, the roadies got all the gear off stage and the Ian didn't come back on to play an encore that would have included a bunch of Roses tracks   , (as indicated on the setlist i collected)   
I really hope the Abart crowd are a bit more sensible.               is playing at the Salzhaus in Winterthur on Sunday, 22 Nov 2009   
And me sadly up in Germany...
		 
			
			The Living End - Aussie pub rock   
Monday 23 Nov Abart Zurich.   
Any interest?             
			
			Scout Niblett's at Abart on at Exil on December 3rd.   
Dinosaur Egg!
		    will be there with the missus and some mates   
went to high school with these guys       At Abart or Exil?   Put the gin bottle down, man.
		    Naughty Hendricks!   
It'sh Exil . . .       
			
			for those going to Temper Trap on the 2nd Dec - the venue has been changed to the Abart
		 
			
			Living End - what a gig man!!!    
AWESOME !!
		    YEA - it was an amazing show!!! And I liked how the venue was really stretched to it's limit, with a crowd surfer almost kicking down a ceiling-mounted stage light and with the bass literally lifting the roof      
best CHF36 I ever spent in Switzerland    
			
			A great venue for a great Band:   
Stereophonics.  
09.02.2010.  
Palais Xtra. ZH
		 
			
			The Temper Trap is playing at Abart Zurich on 2nd. December. 
Is anyone going as well?
		 
			
			Wow just listened to some Youtube vids (Science of Fear, Sweet Disposition and Fader) and they are pretty damn awesome, in fact very awesome, I really like the sound.   
Abart is 50m from my apartment too. Very tempted, will talk to my friend and look at tickets tommorrow. Thanks for the heads-up man.    
			
			You're welcome. Love Abart as it's a smaller venue AND it has a Bar    
			
			got the tickets as soon as i saw they are in CH. really looking forward to seeing them..
		 
			
			Also already secured my tickets for Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten on 22. February. He's amazing live and it will sell-out really fast. Just to give everyone the head's up.      Same here. Should be rad.    
And yep Xaiver Rudd is a go-a in December. Will bet tickets asap
		 
			
			I'll be there at Temper trap - looking forward to it - shame they changed the venue though
		    Thanks for the heads up...I would've turned up at hafenkneipe blissfully unaware that they had changed the venue otherwise. Oh well, bang goes my 3 minute walk...   
Should be an awesome gig though, can't wait to see them live.
		    ...and bang it goes to Richdog. Abarte is at the end of my street.    
Really looking forward to the gig, booking tickets tommorrow.       But Xavier Rudd is in February next year not December?
		 
			
			oops my bad. May miss it cause i'll be in Australia either feb or march
		 
			
			Biffy Clyro is playing at Mascotte in Zurich this Saturday. 
Also for those who have missed it, Editors are playing at X-tra in Zurich with support by the Maccabees! Should be a great gig.
		    Its annoying that one,we are booked for the editors,but would have really liked to see Biffy Clyro.
		 
			
			Same here. Difficult choices      me too - they supported Muse but really we were so far away and as usual the sound is rubbish in Hallenstadion and especially for the support acts. Would have been good to see them in a smaller venue   
see you Sat Mrs O
		 
			
			see you in the bar.
		 
			
			Just seen Filastine is playing at exil in Zurich tomorrow (Friday).  Think that might be mighty interesting.
		     
4th February   at abart   
10th March   at rohstofflager
		    She must have liked it here last time!
		 
			
			David Grey for anyone interested   
X-tra 7th Feb
		    I missed both these on their first visit, hopefully get to see them both on their second
		    Cool i might be keen for that
		 
			
			Gentleman & the Evolution are playing at Maag Event Hall in Zurich on 20th April 2010. Bit far off but tickets will sell fast.    
Gentleman is pretty amazing live!
		 
			
			John Butler Trio coming April 25th 2010 at Maag MusicHall AG  
unfortunately i'll be on a plane to Oz then    
Venue phone: 044 444 26 26.  
Pre-Sale Tix on sale 16th December 10AM
		 
			
			Jase you just made my day!   
I love John Butler Trio, saw them live at Gurten Festival.  
Will get my tickets asap     
Another heads up:   
RJD2 is playing in Bern in May.       
			
			12 March, Zurich, Volkshaus -    bringing his upcoming   work.   
Brothers and sisters in true music, this gig is a keeper of keepers.  I have heard some tasters from the CD, read reviews from in the know people who I trust with their musical opinions, and it promises to be a deep human  , esp. in these obtuse times on the planet earth.  And believe me I have seen Pat Metheny many times (more than any other artist perhaps including Joe Zawinul in the same company) since 1978, so this is full-hearted endorsement.   
If you saw   tour of 1992, and   in 2005, then this tour has the potential to outpass these two extra dimensional gigs.  Metheny is a musician/composer/human being for our times and for all times.   
Here's a neat interview with Metheny       Is RJD2 playing his low tech hip hop stuff (ie. since we last spoke/Dead ringer) or his indie singer-songwriter stuff? cause im not so found of his new direction.   
Edit: Also keen to check out DJ Vadim on Feb 5th if anyones going
		 
			
			Jose james, Kaufleuten Zurich 10th March.

Blood Red Shoes have a new album in March and they are coming to Abart on 29th March.    
			
			Dans le sac vs Scroobius pip play at Sudpol, Luzern 28th Jan.       
For those of you who haven't heard of them before, well worth a listen.    
There are also sections of spoken word from ""Scroobius pip""        
tickets are only 30.00   
Should be a great show
		    They played at Hafenkneipe in Zürich last year.  They must like it here.

I would like to meet people going to the concert?   
Cheers
		 
			
			Thanks for the James Blood Ulmer tip nice!   
I have tickets for the great Element Of Crime next week but i heard its sold out.
		 
			
			Hey people   
sorry for the last minute question, but is anyone going to the concert of Angélique Kidjo in Kaufleuten on Saturday? I'll be there with 2 friends and thought it would be a good ocassion to meet some of you     =   
All the best

Would love to see her... too bad that it's so far and on a Tuesday       will take place from the 7th to the 10th of April in Crans Montana (Valais).   
The program is available here:       
I've never been so far but I might go there on the Friday evening.   and   should be interesting.       I love air but not sure how much tickets are. I thought theyd be expensive because they're crazy popular in Australia
		 
			
			Btw: Does anyone know where I can get tickets to the Stall6 gigs? Im trying to find DJ Vadim tickets online but it seems to be the biggest run around
		    I think you can just email   to reserve tickets . . .
		 
			
			cheers mate
		 
			
			The Blood Arm are playing in Albani Club, Winterthur on 23rd Feb and Bar 59, Luzern 24th. I have seen this band twice in London, and they put on the most entertaining shows of any band I have ever seen.    
Go see them!   
(And if anybody is going to be driving to either one from the Grindelwald area, please let me know...)       Great!!! I'll be there...  Tickets available at:    
(40chf  )
		    Bar 59 is a cool little spot, might go check them out.     
La Roux is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, on the 7th March.
		    Damn, apparently it's sold out.  Anyone want rid of their tickets?
		    Do Kaufleuten normally have additional tickets on the door?
		    Don't know, but would like to find out.
		 
			
			More gigs I would like to go to (but need to work out if I can get back from Zurich on a school night  ):   
Hockey 16 Feb 10 Abart     
Vampire Weekend, May 28 2008   Zurich <-- so errr ignore that, as it's way out of date (Thanks bananahead for spotting!)
		     
Hey Kirsty, you do realise that it is 2010 this year?                 
But they were good    
			
			hmm thanks for pointing out my stupidity... but I would have liked to go! This was my vain search for bands I really like playing in Switzerland, and I turned up... 2   And one of those was 2 years ago! (It said past performances in teeny tiny writing - you can't blame me for getting over excited and missing that!)   
Harumph, so just hockey then...
		     
Hi there, 
You can buy them in Ticket corner,  they are 60.60 CHF general entrance, 
it is not that expensive. 
Are you going? 
Alex
		    The missus might be sorting tickets atm. Will let you know if we are
		    Hockey is ausverkauf.   
I'm not sure if they will have tickets on the door at Abart.

			Kitsuné faves Two Door Cinema Club are playing on January 27th at Ziegel au Lac.       
			
			Coming 27 Jan to the D! Club,   - the one and the only   for a  !!!!  Can not make it for professional commitments in other parts of the continent, but it promises to be da BOMBE.  Such a precocious talent.  A voice and presence        
Check out this clip from 1995 in London.  Whatever you do please stay in your seat...........!!!!!!!!!!       
			
			infected mushroom are playing feb 13 @      
they always seem to be changing style, better than being stagnant I guess, and I'll probably go check it out
		     
I thought he went by the name of Senanda Maitreye these days?   
P.S to save others searching the D Club location as I just did   it's in Lausanne
		 
			
			As a heads up, we actually have a concerts calendar as an option on the main forum calendar. It's somewhat lost because one has to scroll down and change the options to see it - we're working on simplifying this - but  anyway. As these lists get longer and longer, perhaps it'd be useful for others to know from the calendar if you're intending to go. It'll allow a bit of buzz for the event and let others know who's attending.
		     
Nicky, he sure has but thought to put his former name out to those who remember him from 1987 when he came out with  rby album, and several others after until he changed his name to Sananda Maitreya in 2001.   
My bad, I put Lausanne in the Title block but not in the main text!   
Anybody been to the D! Club in, of course, Lausanne?   
			
			Terrence Trent Darby used to be on my wall as a teenager, would love to see him if he did his hold stuff, alas Lausanne a bit too far..
		 
			
			I think I might go to this.    
Will just have to stay up all night and get the first train home  .
		 
			
			Nicky n Natasha   
I think he will play some of the older charts and newer ones too.   
Maybe he is on tour and coming to your area?  I had no idea about this Lausanne gig until I read it in   this Saturday morning.   
Or if you would like a very nice youth hostel near the lake in Lausanne here it is.  Highly recommended and very reasonably priced.  Think 39 chf room with breakfast       
			
			Recently discovered  covering concerts in Switzerland (landlockedblues). May be of interest to see who's around and get the er, skinny. (Is that right? Skinny? Is that still in?)
		 
			
			Deep Purple have you seen this?            
Nat. Sportcenter, Huttwil

			Just seen Trentemoeller is at Hive club tomorrow night (13th)
		 
			
			New Young Pony Club at Hive club on 26th April.       
			
			Woot woot!  Hockey at Abart tomorrow.   
It's total ausverkauf, but it might be worth turning up to get tickets on the door.
		 
			
			Tindersticks are playing Kaufleuten, Zurich on May 5th.   
Miserable feckers. Great live.
		 
			
			It looks like tickets are available on the door for Hockey.   
Doors open at 7.30 . . .
		 
			
			There's a free gig tonight at   by  .   
It starts at 22.00       
			
			The White Lies gig for tonight has been cancelled.   
""Dearest fans. Charles from White Lies here. Im am so so sorry to say that we have to cancel tomorrows show in Munich and the following day in Zurich because Harry has picked up a very nasty viral infection which has destroyed his voice. He's seen doctors from various parts of Europe over the last few days and overdosed on every steroid/anti-inflamatory and pain-killer we could get hold of. But it hasn't worked and today we had to come off stage in Vienna after only 3 songs. We're so sad to have to re-schedule these two shows once again. We had been looking forward to them since December. Please be assured that we will still play these shows for you as soon as we finish the next album and by then have exclusive new songs for you. Love from us all. C W/L""       
(Credit to Dan for spotting this!)
		   are playing at Moods in Zürich as part of the M4Music festival. Saturday, 27th March at 23.00   
Goody goody
		 
			
			anyone going to Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten tonight?
		    A definite Yes!!!       Me, too, me too!
		    Hadouken are a good live act. Noisy fun.   
Very polite young chaps too.   
Here are some photos I took when I saw them in London in 2008:           
			
			Eminem, Jay-Z, Fantastischen Vier, Jan Delay, Stress,...whole bunch others:   
Frauenfeld-weekend of the 9th July.
		 
			
			Gogol Bordello on May 26th in Zurich:       
I unfortunately will be out of town.  
I've seen them once before in concert and they are absolutely amazing....
		 
			
			Faithless are coming to Zurich!    
April 27th at Vilkshaus       
			
			R Kelly will be in Basel the 3rd of April:          Lock up your 15 year old daughters!    
			
			Right, bought my John Butler Trio Tickets for 25th April. 
Can't wait!! Anyone know who support band is?
		 
			
			Benga comes to Bern on the 3rd of April at Reitschule.   
Haven't yet been to a pure dubstep night, this seems like one to go for.  Might be my first night out in Bern too.
		 
			
			Mos Def 24th April at Rote Fabrik. Have put an event in the  .
		 
			
			The Reverend Horton Heat (USA),  Fr 02.04.2010, Zurich       
highly recommended. i've seen them 3 times and if it were not for the concert being in zurich, i'd be there again.    
			
			Damn, sometime I miss living in Zurich...Les Claypool at the Abart club on 10 March.        
			
			Pink Martini a the Kaufleuten 15th July     
			
			and Cat Empire at Schutzenhaus Uetliberg, Zürich           
I guess the title of his tour (""Ladies make some noise"") tells it all    
			
			An hip hop event during Easter in Zurich. It will be the fisrt edition.   
Method Man, The Beatnuts, De la Soul, IAM, Diam's, Hocus Pocus and more performing between the 2nd of April and the 4th of April.             
Imogen Heap is playing tommorow night at Abart, I think tickets are still available.   
			
			I almost bought tickets for      =   
but I'm not sure.    
Opinion anyone?
		 
			
			Posting on behalf of a friend of mine, he organises Stoner rock bands to come over here.  Rock isn't normally my thing but I've hugely enjoyed every concert he put on.   
Locations are either Sedel or the Blues Bar, both in Luzern.  Sedel is the old womens prison, just outside of town, Blues Bar is a tiny room at the back of a latin nightclub, just past schuur.               
			
			Ash are playing Abart on 25th May     
Last time I went to see them was at the University of London Union...seem to remember the night ended up with me drinking Snakebite and Blacks, whilst arm wrestling students...not quite had a similar experience in Switzerland so far...
		 
			
			The Strokes, Stone Temple Pilots, Billy Talent, LCD Soundsystem, NOFX, Wolfmother, 30 Seconds to Mars, White Lies, Kasabian:   
24-27 June, St Gallen.   
Gonna be a rough weekend!
		    Yeah . . . especially without any decent bands        
*GROAN*   
sorry DJ Bobo wasn't available, he's kinda hard to get a hold of this time of the year
		    Well, I'd probably give LCD Soundsystem the time of day . . .   
And I note that The Strokes have a new album out in 2010.   
Not the freshest line up though, is it?
		 
			
			Yeah, I'm really going for the Strokes and STP (and I have a gulity pleasure for Billy Talent too, but I'm in therapy for it).   
The rest will just be cool filler, perhaps some surprises.
		 
			
			Huge Euro festivals suck. Small festivals suck harder. It's all a big con to get us to consume more product. Bring back touring.
		    What you want is small 'conference' festivals in towns:  SXSW, Stag and Dagger, The Great Escape
		    What I want is a seven foot blond chick with natural curves and green eyes who'll turn into a pizza at 3am, but I appreciate your sentiment.
		    Certain to be available at all the above events, if you do them right.
		    Ahhh I saw Ash at the Astoria last year. It was great. I will try and get along to this one. It's a school night though    
Happy memories of ULU... They used to do the best nachos to go with your snakebite!
		 
			
			I've seen Ash 3 or 4 times at various stages of their career and they have yet to be less than awesome   Best time was in a little venue in Hastings and Silver Sun were the support.   
Ah, Silver Sun - their debut album was fantastic!!
		 
			
			Saxon - Z7 - Thursdsay night.
		 
			
			Blood Red Shoes at Abart on March 29th          Indeed           
Looking forward to it lots.
		    please tell your friend to send some of these bands to lausanne...      concert cancelled !!!
		 
			
			The Moon and Stars' festival (in Locarno) programme is available:       
Too bad that Locarno is that far!!!   
I hope that JK will give another concert elswhere in Switzerland       Would go to see LCD, STP and Wolfmo but the FREAKIN World Cup is on, priorities priorities.    
I see the Gurten has Faith No More headlining - enough said. Wont be going to see that rubbish again.
		    They'll be showing all the matches from big screens so it won't be that you'll have to miss anything....btw Mike Patton is GOD!
		    To be honest its the WorldCup, I need to be comfortable when Im watching the Greatest Show on Earth!   
Hmmm MP is a deity huh... The Real Thing is their seminal album granted, in fact I still regularly listen to it, but their material got progressively Pattonised (weird and experimental in want of actual music) culminating in the God awful Mr Bungle. Discuss...
		     
I don't know how I can discuss such ignorance politely    
Different strokes I suppose and if you prefer the Mike Patton that sings Lionel Richie covers then so be it... I guess I couldn't interest you in his work with John Zorn then       No need to be polite, we are discussing Patton after all. Angel Dust was after The Real Thing, and about the time I started to loose interest. Jizzlobber was the last straw. Terrible.
		 
			
			I for one am stoked to see FNM headlining the Gurten Festival!!!    
btw...   
epic < angel dust < king for a day < album  of the year   
tomahawk is also awesome.   
peeping tom is really good too.    
mr bungle and fantomas are acquired tastes but absolutely incredible live.
		     
what's a world cup?         
Sorry, not my thing
		    Unfortunately this world cup is not played with sticks so guess your national team didnt qualify, u could always support the USA       He does a great job, I'll post them up in events shortly, but if you'e a big fan of any of the bands, it'd worth the trip to Luzern.  Both venues are very small and you get right up close to the band.
		 
			
			Soccer world cup? I know what id rather do..... Anything. But then again I'll watch anything when im loaded   
Anyone going to this M4 music thingo tomorrow? Keen to see Jose Gonzalez again. Last time I saw him the sound was awful and it was a horrible setup
		    Jeff Beck!
		    yeah but in support of ZZ Top? ewww....      
but i will say tho that Jeff Beck was amazing at Montreux Jazz Festival a couple years ago. probably my favorite guitarist evah!    
			
			FYI Paleo Festival has announced their lineup....meh           
besides Iggy & the Stooges & Indochine... meh indeed
		    Two Door Cinema Club and We Have Band are worth seeing.   
Foals are very definitely worth seeing . . . amazing live performers.  Klaxons too.   
I'll happily dance to Vitalic and Yuksek.   
N*E*R*D pretty good live too.
		    So I can see what snazzy dressers they are? Sorry, generic ""indie"" music bores me nowadays. Good point about N.E.R.D. & Vitalic though.
		    There's a big difference between TDCC and something like Coldplay or the Kooks.  There's electronica and afro-pop in there.  Yes, they're snappy dressers, but that's part of the deal if you sign to Kitsuné.  Not sure how they'd come across on a festival stage though.
		     
Which they stole from Vampire Weekend, who stole it from Paul Simon, who stole it from Fela Kuti. Shame he's dead now...
		    . . .  who stole it from someone else in Africa . . . etc etc blah blah blah   
You think there's a chance of completely ahistoric music with no antecedents?  And that bands shouldn't use some of the same sounds and influences?  TTCM fall some way in between Vampire Weekend and Foals, but have their own sound.  Vampire Weekend are more preppy/New England.  Foals miss out the Afro-pop, but have some of the same kind of indie-dance and free range guitar.
		    meh indeed
		   26.05.2010: Foals @ Abart, Zurich  
Tickets are available from    
			
			Port O'Brien playing in Zurich, Basel and Luzern this weekend. I have seen them in Dublin before and they were great live! Recommend.   
Hopefully they will still make it despite volcano issues!
		 
			
			Stevie Wonder at Moon and Stars on 7th July.
		 
			
			Crystal Castles at rohstofflager, Zürich on the 27th April, might try and make that.
		    play the Idaplatzfest in Zurich, 21st August, showcasing their second album      Perhaps      playing this Friday night at 8pm at Kaufleuten Zurich.
		 
			
			Not sure if it's already pegged in here, but The Eels are playing in Winterthur on August 28th, supported by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  Tix are 54 CHF from Starticket.   
Also the night before, Paolo Nutini is playing the same spot.   
Looks like an open air music week in old town Winterthur, should be cool. (Events already created for both in the Concerts calendar)
		 
			
			I've created a social event in the calendar for the Tunng gig on Wednesday.
		 
			
			this looks promising:        
at least for friday night.       What is it about the Swiss and Skunk Ananse?? 
Every other country got tired of them in weeks!   
The Eels looks promising!
		     
When you figure that out please explain to me their fascination with Amy Macdonald.   
It's just Eels btw, no ""the""
		     Cool, miss living there.
		    Anyone fancy it, or already going?
		    Er . . . that was last night wasn't it?
		    May, no?   
(too short)
		    Ooops . . .  I am living in the future!     (Yes . . . there are flying cars here and everything)   
			
			This looks good, an open-air festival for Zurich at long last.  i'll be there for Underworld and Booka Shade.  I'll try for Placebo but tradition dictates I turn up right at the end of their encore...          I've posted an event for this:       
			
			Bump for the Tindersticks playing at Kaufleuten tonight. Anyone else in?
		 
			
			Jimi Tenor and Tony Allen at the Kaserne tonight (8/5/10). Tony Allen was the band leader for Fela Kuti, but his solo stuff since then is less of the traditional afrobeat. Fans of experimental rock and jazz should check it out!
		 
			
			They obviously like it here     
mo. 29.11. -  - abart
		   Mike Patton's Mondo Cane   Thursday , 29.07.2010   20h00  Luzern (CH)  KKL Luzern - Konzertsaal    
			
			A.R Rahman concert 
Hallenstadion Zurich 
16 July        thanks for posting. that would be a VERY interesting show to see.    
but it seems like most concert announcements just make me realize i'm on the wrong side of switzerland.       Foals were amazing last night.  Tracks from the second album are generally more contemplative than those from the first and therefore less appropriate for a live performance.  The old/new split was about 70/30.  It's just incredible the way the band plays together . . . precise but intensely passionate.  Many times throughout the gig I just went 'wow'.  The final song, 'One Step, Two Step' left the crowd on a high.
		 
			
			not sure if anyone has posted it yet, but Slash is touring his new album in June. He's playing X-tra on the 16th of June. Miles Kennedy is on vocal duties.   
from what i've read they are playing a healthy mix of tracks from Slashs' back catalogue and the new stuff.  i'm really looking forward to this one.           
			
			Another overlooked festival, just saw a poster for it...Neuchatel Open Air.   
Cypress Hill! Looks like a nice location too.        
			
			What about the   in Lucerne   
Shame about the name.... I think its for the sexually frustrated
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this but....      - Abart, Monday 5th July, CHF35   
Fo sho!
		    Oh how gutted i was to hear this was on the 5th July, the day i go on holiday! VERY gutted
		    damn have my mother here from Oz that week. Might take her with us    
			
			Almost missed this one, John Garcia plays Kyuss at Schuur tonight (2nd June), Luzern.
		 
			
			i'm going to see them tomorrow in lausanne. i didn't bother posting coz i really didn't think there was anyone here interested.   
should i also mention baroness is playing in fribourg in july? my new favorite band.    
			
			A band I know will be playing Thu, June 10 in Stall 6. 
African Percussions and a singer from Gambia. 
P-Train & Lamine Jobarteh.   
CHF 10.-            
			
			The Kissaway Trail the highlight (for me) of this year's For Noise festival in Pully (near Lausanne).       
			
			I'm surprised no one has mentioned Prince in Geneva on 12 July.        
			
			Not sure if this has already been mentioned   
29th Sept Hallenstadion    
I am so there!   
Tickets for ticket corner members went on sale today, general public tomorrow I think, many pre sales tickets already sold out so get up early tomorrow folks    
			
			Say what now? I thought I knew you! interwebz-wise.       stick with me Debz and i'll show you the way    
come on who can not be a Peter Gabriel fan?
		             
anyone born after 1980       Phil Collins fans?
		 
			
			anyone coming to Bsides festival today?
		 
			
			Possibly, keeping an eye on the weather.
		    Damn . . . didn't spot that.  Not sure if I can come now.   
Three Trapped Tigers are excellent.
		 
			
			Hmmmm . . . Crystal Fighters are playing at the Imagine Festival in Basel tomorrow.       
Am I right in thinking this is free?   
Anyone else going?
		     
it is free, might be going.
		 
			
			I've already booked and paid for my Guns n Roses tickets.   
Geneva, 16th September at the Arena (beside the Airport)
		 
			
			I'm probably a bit slow off the mark, but Mumford and Sons are playing (with Sophie Hunger) the Montreux JF on 14th July. Tickets are note available on the ticketcorner site but, unlike other, it is not marked as sold out on the Montreux site.   
I'm also very tempted by Julian Casablancas with Vampire Weekend but at 80.- it's a bit steep. There are tickets available for that though.   
Does anyone know where else I might be able to get tickets? I can get to Montreux to buy them next week if this is necessary...   
Merci d'avance!
		 
			
			More rock at Sedel, Luzern.   
July 2nd 
Yawning Man   
July 4th 
Mondo Generator   
July 8th 
Valient Thorr
		 
			
			Devendra Banhart is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, Tuesday July 13th. Tickets from        
			
			Its not a Swiss gig so please don't shoot me down but we are off Wed to Belgium to what I reckon is the BEST open air festival in the world.....   
Werchter Festival is so damn well organised and has a solid line up every year. Just 8 hours drive. You can't beat it peoples.   
ROCKONAUSTRALIA !!!        decent festival but Primavera destroys all
		 
			
			careful with your ears, folks.    
my last concert, john garcia plays kyuss, might be my last concert.    
since then, i have tinnitus. BAD. this sucks.    
i will post up some tinnitus info at some point but please take care of your ears.   
/sweet blog
		    Nice!  I may have to think about this... haven't had my fill of weird yet this year.    One of my all-time favorites:   
[maybe this should be in song of the day...]   
But on a Tuesday?!? Come on!   
EDIT: Anyone here planning to go?  I am so up for it but pretty sure my roomie wouldn't be interested...
		 
			
			Baby was a black sheep, baby was a whore. Baby got big but she's gonna get bigger..... Anyone going to see Patti Smith in the Rote Fabrik on Wednesday? 
I really hope she only plays old songs, but it's not too far to walk home if she does.
		 
			
			here's an 'under-the-radar' festival...in grandson VD...          Oh man, missed that and probably can't go now.   
Love this song:       
			
			It'll be outside, on the lakeside, so you could in theory, come watch the football, outside, and listen to her in the background. It's going to be quite a night! I'll be up on the roof!        I really should be but the devil on my left shoulder told me to go watch football instead.
		 
			
			Rodney Branigan at the Cava.....     
			
			anyone interested in Baroness at Bad Bonn (Düdingen), 13 July? I got some super dooper expensive earplugs to try out.        
			
			Patti was legendary. The lake was magnificent, and Germany lost. Was that the perfect night?        crap i just saw this! i love patti smith- seen her a ton of times and poetry stuff too... wish i knew i'd have definitely gone...   
i've even got a gorgeous photo of her holding my then 6month old son at a poetry event in nyc... wah. a bit sad now i need to keep up on these things...   
			
			I want to be half that cool when I'm 62!       I would have loved to have gone , but I got the feeling that you would have got the weird Patti doing performance art versions of stuff, rather than the angry Horses version ... 
If it was the later then I wish I had gone !
		    was incredible.                
			
			T'was the latter. I expected a post-menapausal, I know it all and I'm gonna pass on the word Patti, but she rocked! Right up til her final song, which was rock and roll nigga. Having said that, she didn't actually do horses.     
			
			The Coral are playing Abart on November 2nd   
Should be a really good gig and tickets are only 35CHF       
			
			Mike Patton fans- Mondo Cane will be in Lucerne the 29th at the  .

          30.11.             (usa) &    (uk)   
sif you would go to Helmet. ffs its HELMET!!!!
		     
almost word for word what a friend said to me when he saw that    
Xiu Xiu in St Gallen in November..
		 
			
			ooh, i'd like to see those Drums in action.  (is the day before my birthday too, sounds like a good excuse for a big friday night)   
i'd be interested in seeing kate nash covered in whipped cream and lip-synching too, but only for laughs             A very good excuse indeed! It would be nice to see you there ... I've got my ticket ...      Yep, I agree, only for laughs, but as I do not like the location, I most probably skip that one.
		 
			
			i have just been informed that the Scissor Sisters are playing the on the 15th of November.          HELL YEAH!    
but that's a looong drive for a tuesday night.      
holy crap! after a quick search they are playing in Yverdon on Dec 1st. STOKED!
		    hope they are better than when they were at hallenstadion, worst gig in my history of gigs and i only had to endure half of it
		    I'll buy ya a beer, so take the train    
			
			02.12.2010 gossip @ x-tra, zurich 
info:   (german)
		 
			
			I see Booker T is playing  tomorrow (21st July). Rather peeved to only spot this now, plus to have to miss it due to soccerball.
		    wish i could. you're very lucky to have the abart. when i lived in zurich, i only saw 3 concerts there (in 3 years) due to working so much and just being out of the loop. recently i went and looked at the history of who has been there since i left in 2001 and thought i was gonna be sick.    
king's x at the abart was one of my favoritist shows ever.    
			
			Here's a few gigs that might be of interest in the ""near"" future:   
Pendulum 30/09 Xtra CHF45   
Goldfrapp 05/10 Xtra CHF60   
The Coral 02/11 Abart CH37

The Drums 19/11 Abart CHF43   
Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan 26/11 Kaufleuten CHF48   
Blood Red Shoes 29/11 Abart CHF35     Sorry for any repeats!   
			
			Pendulum, oh boy, might have to get in early on that one..
		 
			
			Kap Bambino at X-Tra in Zürich this Friday!       
(not sure that's the best of venues though)
		 
			
			It's notable how many bands return to Zürich soon after playing here.  Dan mentioned Blood Red Shoes above, Beach House too.  Do they think it's cool here or is it the strong CHF?   
Here's another returner . . . Au Revoir Simone at Abart on August 23rd, they were good at Stall 6 last September.   
Other acts that may or not be returning:   
Mystery Jets at Abart on 11th October

Eintritt Frei!
		    Paging Gastro Gnome...that thoroughly nice chap is playing for free    
Sadly I'll be somewhere else...   
Oh, and I assume you mean September instead of October       Funnily enough I've met Gilles a couple of times through a friend.  She was visiting London from Estonia and was a big fan of worldwide.  She went to his club and got chatting to him.  He invited her to his house the next day and sent her off with a load of vinyl . . . she went back to Tallinn and became a DJ.  Nice chap.   
Have I already told you that story before?
		     
nice lil' story which doesn't amaze me all that much. Peterson seems like such a nice bloke at least on the radio show    
I might make the drive out ... Zükunft is such a great little club with an awesome vibe and the woodblock prints for announcing the nights
		    I'm not sure you got to the vinyl bit as those pesky Foals were a playing there thingys awfully loud    
*worldwide worldwide worldwide*
		    Ah yes . . . it's all coming back to me . . .
		 
			
			Is anybody heading to Rote Fabrik on Saturday to see The Maccabees?   
It's free from what i can understand of this-        
I might be if I can get out of prior arrangements
		 
			
			Pink Floyd fans should be headed to Dietikon, ZH Saturday evening 9-18-10:          Brilliant!  Yeah . . . I'd like to go and see them.

See    
			
			The Morning Benders tonight at Salzhaus Winterthur   
support is the fantastic Sheila She Loves You from Basel
		 
			
			I can't believe I just read about Maccabees now it now. 
They are pretty cool!
		    It was an excellent gig, more so for being free.  We should lobby them to return.
		 
			
			The brilliant band The Wedding Present are playing on the 31 october in the Mariaberg in Rorschach:     
...why Rorschach       And they're playing Bizarro!?!?!?!?!   
Hmmm . . . might have to look at a hotel there . . .
		    Yes might be an option.    
Not doable on public transport as the last train departing towards Zurich leaves at 22.40.   
Why don't they play at the Volkshaus in Zurich like normal bands do?  
Don't get their marketing strategy?!   But then if they ever had a marketing strategy they'd be a world famous band by now.
		    Their biggest marketing push, as far as I remember, was quite perverse and involved releasing a seven inch single for every month of 1992.  I had 'em all, but have somehow lost track of them.       too much apple pie, Tubbs           
I just checked them out - thanks for the tip - I love them!!  Shame they don't have more dates up on their calendar but I will keep an eye out.  Hope there are more bands like them around - gives me hope    
			
			Nothing beats   for finding out what's on. 
You filter by date, price, distance willing to travel, can link to other social sites etc..
		    How do I see everything in Zürich.   
It just came back with this limited selection:        Hmmm . . . I tried registering.   
Does it only show you bands you track?      I've just spent ten minutes getting nothing but frustrated with that site.  I simply want to see what's on in Zürich.  Instead it seems I have to track a load of bands.  Can't I just track Zürich?
		    Don't know if you meant Sheila she loves you or the morning benders but if it was the first they are playing in La Catrina in Zürich tmw evening for   good idea to get there a bit early though as it fills up quickly.
		    They usually play at least 3 times a year in Switz anyhow..
		    Who told you that? The Wedding Present have hardly ever played 3 times a year in Switzerland (if ever).
		    Yes - Shelia she loves you - I won't be in Switzerland until the 11th October but will checking out all the bands and venues.  Do the gigs usually finish in time to catch the last train back from Zurich to Basel?  Here in scotland there are some venues that run 7 to 10 pm and last train is about 11pm but most venues run to midnight or later.
		    Well if you're moving to Basel I'm sure you'll have plenty of chances to see them. Most venues try to finish in time for the last train but it doesn't always work out.
		    Perhaps slightly exaggerated but they do come through quite often. I know for sure they've played Sommercasino in Basel several times.
		     
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finntroll @ Konzertfabrik Z7 - Dec 12!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't know that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank the holy lord that I was browsing this thread!!!!! One of my current favorite Bands of all time... Slightly strange coincidence too.   
So um, anybody else going?    
			
			Black Rebel Motorcycle Club @ Zurich Volkshaus November 14th   
Can find it listed everywhere but can't find tickets yet...
		   , Luzern on the 15th of October, unfortunately I'll miss it as I'm DJ at Bar 59 the same night.
		 
			
			for those in Lausanne. BRMC are also playing at a festival on the 13.11.2010       
can't find Zurich tickets yet either, but i'll be there.         
			
			Zurich tickets from ticketcorner.ch

			Nick Cave and the Grindermen will be playing at the Folkshaus next Tuesday in Zürich. Anyone else going?

Shellac is playing in Bern on the same day , a bit torn between the two.If he would be singing bad seeds songs it would be easier.
		 
			
			Tell me about it! I'm immersing myself in Grinderman, to get used to it so I won't be too confused on the day. Having said that, they may do a couple of their badseed songs.       
			
			Dollhouse (SWE) play mascotte today (tuesday)- starts around 20h and some norwegian band will open for them.

Bandsintown.com is pretty cool but has some limitations. I'd like to be able to opt out specific locations (like Zurich and anything in France) and it would be cool if you could feed it a list of bands from your music collection. Aside from that a nice utility. A friend told me about something similar that works with your itunes collections, feeds your band names into a database and returns upcoming concerts for bands in your collection plus similar bands.
		    How was the show?      Thank you!   
27th October @            
			
			Not sure if its been mentioned but a band from my home town in Australia are playing on Nov 5. Really Psychedelic but pretty decent the only time ive seen them    
Tame Impala 
Nov 5 @ Mascotte, Zurich
		 
			
			Club night rather than gig: Nu:Tone (Hospital Records)* & Stamina MC are playing at Kaserne, Basel on Sat 23rd Oct:    
Will be heading over from Zurich, anyone else going?   
* UK Drum and Bass producer and DJ
		 
			
			A bit disapointing to be honest. Maybe it was just too early in the tour. Some of it worked, some of it was a disaster. Nick was looking alot like Bunny Munroe.        Hmm. I saw him in Liverpool once; someone shouted ""C'mon Phil Collins"" and he never recovered. To think he let Kylie slip from his arms...
		 
			
			I don't want to talk about         I've met stamina at a house party once. Hes a cool dude. I could make it out for this one. I love hospital artists
		 
			
			Anyone going to see Santana tonight? My old man (who is a good laugh) is going by himself and he probaly wouldn't mind meeting up with some fellow old skool fans.       Anyone going to the Deftones show in Fribourg?  Has anyone been to that venu; is it large, small etc?  Thanks!
		    depending on which hall they use it can hold anywhere from 300 to about 3000 people. Considering it's the Deftones I'd imagine it would be the larger one. Frison is one of the best concert venues in Switz imo. One drawback to it though is that if you're in Basel or ZH it's often difficult to get back home with the train if you wanna stay till the end of the concert.
		    i'm going!    
i saw mastodon there last spring and i enjoyed it but have to say the acoustics there are pretty bad. there are certain spots where the reverberations from the big walls will turn the music into a horrible constant roar. a few feet to the left or right and it's ok again. also, there are no elevated viewing areas (all just a big floor) so if you are on the short side it might not be ideal. otherwise, i like the old warehouse style of venue.
		    Hmm, well i'd be comming from Basel so i guess i should start to look for someone with a car (if anyone is going anway?) or try and find a place to stay.  I wish there were better concert venues in Basel!  Thanks for the info!
		     
a friend of mine might be going with a car. Ask me when the time comes.
		    Cool, I'll prob catch the train over in the eve, let me know if you want to meet up.
		 
			
			Saw sharon jones and the dap kings last night @ kaufleuten and they were amazing. Invited two of my mates and they also raved about the show.   
First time ive been to kaufleuten too. Really cool venue. Might be a little posh for me though    
			
			Anyone going to see   on Friday?  Let me know, I'm going with another lady friend by train from Zurich hb.

		    Ooh! Ooh!  I would totally join for Seu Jorge! But I'll be out of town.  
Ah well, next time. 
Let me know how the show is; never seen him live and most of the albums I love of his are *quite* a few years old.
		    Check out his  stuff!  
If you haven't already seen the LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU you must.
		    Balls. Im back home for Xmas. Bonobo is dooooooope
		 
			
			is there anyone interested in two free tickets to KARMA TO BURN playing in Martigny on Nov 3rd? i can't go now due to other plans. i hate to see good tickets go to waste...PM me if interested.
		     
Decent band and nice guys. I would take those tickets off you if only 1) I knew where Martigny was, and 2) David Max and the Sons of Void weren't playing in Basel and Spectrum weren't playing in Basel on the same night.
		 
			
			i was all set to drive an hour to martigny to see them, bought 2 tickets for me and a friend, then later discovered that i had mistaken the date and have another concert (public enemy) on the same night. then to top it off, they booked another show in yverdon on the next night, which is even closer than martigny. i'm planning to go to that one.        
Thank you so much for your post!   
I am definitely going to Seu Jorge's concert! 
Is anyone from Basel joining too?!
		 
			
			Moorcheeba with Skye (26th) in Zurich

Sweet    
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned   as a gig guide/general stuff to do resource...just happened to see a copy of it on the tram this morning and it's a pretty comprehensive       Indeed.  I'm not sure if it's entirely comprehensive though.   
The @zueritipp Twitter feed is laughable.

			Went there for the first time last night to see Caribou and Shy Child - what a fantastic dive it is ! I miss the toilet venues in London (Dublin Castle, Windmill, Notting Hill Arts Club and so on) and this place would not look out of place if it was in a side street off Oxford Street.   
Recommended if you like down and dirty venues and interesting up and coming bands.   
Shy Child totally kicked bottom. I enjoyed Caribou but after half an hour felt I had enjoyed them sufficiently.   
Coming up - Beach House, The Swans, A Place To Bury Strangers and in January The Fall   
Pay on the door, no advance booking, no credit cards. Like stepping back to the seventies but in a GOOD way.           
Ive been hearing her songs in the local Migros a lot actually. Maybe they have her album or that she's gaining a little notoriety in Switzerland?
		 
			
			of course, in response to this....  i have to offer up the original.  I was never a massive Chisel fan, before my time, but I know every word to this one.                     Only the two in Zurich...but at the Xavier Rudd on 21st and Panteon Rococo on 24th (also in abart)

			Hey Pol, what is Komplex?             Hey Nic. Komplex is a new location (Hohlstrasse 457, Zurich - next to Letzipark). From what I've heard it is bigger than Abart and a good alternative ....
		    Strangely at the same address as Dollhouse  . Could make for some interesting shows.
		    So I look on their website and pop up a post. And then the next day I get a newsletter saying that it's not Zurich but Luzern.

			If any of youse are keen on your blues, C.W. Stoneking is playing @ El Lokal, Zurich on the 27th Feb.    
His version of seven nation army on TripleJ a few years ago was a think of beauty. Id post it but its block out of Australia    
			
			Ah, I can't believe I missed Lambchop. And Mark Lanegan, that hurts. And Einsturz. And New Model Army, they are still playing? Wowsies...I should really watch this thread.
		 
			
			Also I saw K&D are playing at Volkshaus on Jan 29th. Im super double mega pumped to see this if anyone's keen for a catch up
		    just got informed that johen arbeit will not be be playing after all      UPDATE VOM 07.01.2011: Leider musste Jochen  Arbeit die Tour aus familiären Gründen absagen. Brian Mitchell wird aber  im Café Kairo eine Solo-Show spielen.      Love love love C.W. Stoneking!   He will also be playing at ISC in Bern on 17th of Feb - this has just made my day.

			<3 the Cold War Kids! Thanks for the heads up on this show!      I've been living in Boston for two years now, and will be moving to Basel in a couple of months. The Dropkick Murphys put on a great show!
		 
			
			Thanks for the heads up...I saw them in Manchester many moons ago, and unfortunately they really did come off as a two/three song band. Still might be worth a watch in a small venue like the Abart.          When will you be in Basel?  If you want to meet up and have a chat or see a show drop me a line    Always nice to meet someone comming from Boston.
		    Sounds like a good show.  I will probably join.  Anyone else going?  Is this venu easy to get to from the main station?
		    Hi JustRose,       (from the Bahnhofquai/HB tramstop)  direction Albisgütli and get off at the Sihlcity Nord stop or you can catch the S4 Train (from track 1 at the Zürich HB) and get off at the Gieshubel stop. Both stops are walking distance.       Looks like the Black Keys have cancelled    
On the plus side Mogwai will play Rote Fabrik on Friday 11th March, tickets CHF35.

			Thin Lizzy are playing at Z7 in Pratteln on Thursday 3rd Feb.
		 
			
			I'm definitely going to catch the Foo Fighters at Greenfield this year. The teaser for new sound songs great (well at least the first 30 seconds). Sounds more like their older stuff.     
			
			my favourite song of the foo fighters is "" my hero"", followed by ""the pretender"" and ""wheels"". 
Looking forward to the festival........
		 
			
			I can't make it to Greenfield this year as ill be away so am planning to go to Southside festival (in southern germany) instead.  Anyone been to southside in past years?  It looks like a really great lineup this year: 
Foo Fighters * Blink-182 * Arcade Fire * The Chemical Brothers *Portishead * Arctic Monkeys * Clueso * The Hives * The Subways * Gogol Bordello * Flogging Molly * Elbow * The Wombats * Sublime With Rome * Two Door Cinema Club * Boysetsfire * Selig * Band Of Horses * The Sounds * Klaxons * Eels * Sick Of It All * Parkway Drive * William Fitzsimmons * I Am Kloot * Friendly Fires * Darwin Deez * Converge * Comeback Kid * Portugal.

			The line up for the m4music festival (24.-26.03.2011) is finally out:

		    I saw 'Does it Offend you , Yeah?' in London a couple of years ago.  Quite underwhelming though.    
I'm not a huge Streets fan, but this is a must see as it will be the final tour ever.
		    I'll be there! Anyone else?

			Ever since we moved to basel in October we have been on the hunt for local unsigned indie bands in cool small venues.  So far we have been to 2 gigs - both great but we are used to 2 or 3 a week!!!  Seems the venues are here but not always our genre of music (too heavy or hip-hop etc..)  so after waiting patiently - we have 2 gigs next weekend!! And all Swiss bands!!   
Friday the 25th at Kuppel for the Choo Choo's of Bern and the Kapoolas from Basel   
Saturday the 26th for Basel's own: Shelia She Loves You and the Oh' No's (two of the bands we've already seen) at the Union Kultur Club.   
Along with seeing the Charivari on Monday night (to see the Top Secret Drummers) its gonna be a good week!!!!
		 
			
			^ Sheila She Loves You are fab - their last gig at la Catrina in ZH last year was my fave gig of the whole year. I hope they make it back to ZH sometime soon!
		 
			
			Queens of the Stone Age

			In basel try out 
Nordstern 
Hirshnek 
NT areal
		    Cheers for the heads up. Just bagged me some tickets      The one venue we really liked was Sommer Casino - they do a lot of rock, metal as well as hip/hop.  Only a couple indie nights over the last few months.  Also look at the Kaserne - this is right near us and looks fab from the outside but nothing on their calendar really appeals to us.
		    I have to yet find heavy and actually interesting here, but it is not like I venture out much for this, we live in a tiny place...so gota give it real chance. The stuff I have heard was either to eager to be heavy, leaving everything else behind, or noise for the sake of noise, but I am sure there is something worth listening.
		 
			
			queens of the stone age will also be at this year's kilby at bad bonn!!!! can't wait to find out the rest of the lineup!           Just some info on tix: tickets go on sale this  , limited to 4 per person, from either        
or        
Tix are expected to sell out fast, so get in quick!
		 
			
			After lots of wondering why there had been no news, I was sad to hear today that there will be no Zurich Open Air Festival this year   - last year's line-up was so awesome.   
BUT   
it is confirmed for 2012. Yay!       
			
			Bad Kilbi Bonn's a great festival, great atmosphere and generally good bands there. I saw the legendary Sunn o))) there a couple of years ago.
		     :d
		    And they are now sold out.
		 
			
			The Sadies @ El Lokal May 29 ... Also playing the Stolze Open Air Festival Zurich on May 28th     
cheers, 
Sue
		    ahem      
Anyway. She was fantastic.   
It was my first time at Komplex. And it's tiny. I was expecting somewhere a bit bigger than abart but I think it's actually smaller. Although it does have a higher ceiling which helps with the sound.
		    Smaller than Abart?!  Mmkay, explains why QOTSA sold out so quickly.
		    I'm sad that I missed her      
The Komplex venue can be rearranged for bigger shows. The walls are all moveable - actually it's a huge space. That's why it can accommodate bigger acts like QOTSA, My Chemical Romance, Interpol etc etc as well as the smaller ones (Phoenix Foundation, Caitlin Rose) I think the capacity is up to 5000.
		 
			
			Looks like British Sea Power have cancelled their March European tour,  including the Abart gig on the 09.03.11.    
Not sure why....but Noble cracked a rib at the last gig. Bummer!   
Gigs will hopefuly be re-scheduled for later in 2011.
		    Yep, it is planned to be re-scheduled ... or at least that is the plan so far. Fingers crossed!       I used to love Belle and Sebastian until I saw them at Open Air last year, they were pretty lame.    
			
			Haha, got sucked in and forgot what I came on here originally to post    
Anyone else going to Roger Waters this summer? I am already looking forward to it!! I just can't wait haha    
			
			I am going! can't wait       I bought The Boy With The Arab Strap when it first came out on vinyl but never really got into it. Then late last year I bought the latest and love it. Since then I have bought all of the CD's so I hope I'm not disappointed but I think they will be better indoors than out. And it should have a totally different vibe to a festival.

José is a world renowned guitarist, born in Brazil but living in Nyon. He used to teach at the Geneva conservatoire, and has appeared many times at The Paleo and Montreux Jazz festivals. A brilliant artist.
		    When you think they started as a college project, they've come far from the days of playing King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow.   
I've seen them a few times and they always deliver, but can get a little twee. At one show at the Rote Fabrik they covered Dire Straits' Romeo and Juliet. Hmm. Since Isobel Campbell left, so did the darker elements. Still worth seeing though    
			
			Atari Teenage Riot are playing @ Salzhaus, Winterthur 21.05.2011:

			Noise fans,  is playing tomorrow (sun March 6th, 9pm), in Geneva, at  .    
I was curious myself, saw this performer from New Zeland 3 days ago in Prague and he blew my mind. Plus, he is a really cool dude, high school prof on his sabatical touring the world with his musical mission. He is quite big in his field, so far on this tour he has played in UK, Scandinavia, CZ, FR, after CH he is going to Japan. Just a note for the gentle souls amongst us, bring ear plugs (just in case the sound guy sucks  ).    
It's short and sweet, very intense and a ton of dizzy fun. We are going.
		     
Wow...just checked out the Gurtenfestival...many bands I like!

			Yes please.           that sounds really good, shame I missed it.
		 
			
			Lloyd Cole small ensemble 13th April at Restaurant Viadukt.
		    Actually, it was awesome....The Geneva performance better than in Prague, then, Cave 12 threw a gig yesterday -  and  also quite obscure noise, I am sorry I have missed those 2.    
But, were very lucky to have Campbell Kneale of  on our couch past few days, weeheee...a lot of interesting talk.    
Check out Cave12 in Geneva, it's a fantastic project, loads of gigs are in  , an experimental culture place, I think it used to be a squat, unsurprisingly. I love the venue, nice people, guests and staff. Cave12 are great, too. Very approachable, I want to gig with them, when we finally put sh...t together.

2 Day music festival in Basel - April 1st and 2nd. Figures we are in scotland that weekend for a 2 day music festival in Edinburgh but anyone else looking for live music (indie, etc...) in little venues should consider going!!   
I've been to a couple of the venues and they were great (summer casino, kaserne) and have seen The Kapoolas and really liked them.   
Oh and Shelia she loves you!!  Very good local Basel band!

Snoop Dogg, Lil Wayne, Cypress Hill, Wyclef Jean, The Roots, Taio Cruz, Ice Cube, Black Star (Mos Def and Talib Kweli), M.O.P, Public Enemy....to name a few.   
Sounds like a hot ticket
		 
			
			for the same customers(frauenfeld) is the festival in wohlen (Touch the air), june 23th to 26th with timabland, akon, ludacris, busta rhymes to name a few     
			
			British band The Brew playing the Galery Music Bar near Z7 in Pratteln tomorrow night        Yes that looks a great line-up. Underworld are amazing live, and been wanting to see 2ManyDJs live for a long time. 
I'll hopefully be able to spend the whole weekend there.     
And for this weekend (Sat 2nd April): Kings Of The Jungle @ Komplex Zürich:        
			
			Another reminder for my mates awesome Rock'nRoll April events at Sedel, Luzern, stoner/pysch/desert/doom rock.   Different concerts on the 3rd, 8th, 21st(22nd is a holiday btw, so you can stay out late) and the 23rd of April, see   for details.       
Sedel is a great venue for these bands, I just wish it was a little closer to town.  Shuttle busses do run every half hour I think and only cost a tip for the driver.
		 
			
			Also, just seen   and   are playing Stall 6 in Zurich on the 2nd of April.  Loving whatever that scene is, electronic hip hop beats, monster bass and synths.  Their albums are well worth a listen if you don't mind a bit of the electronic).   
Edit : FFS, Young Gods play Sedel on the same night, and it's a friends birthday, damn.
		 
			
			The line-up for the Palèo Festival has just been announced - The National, PJ Harvey, Portishead, Beirut, The Strokes, Anna Calvi, The Chemical Brothers and more...               
			
			Filter at Abart on 22 June       there are some fine acts playing there but mainly during the week and I've got to work!    
			
			Best thing about Paleo, for me, has always been the discovery of acts I would've never seen otherwise...  &   come to mind in recent memory
		 
			
			Don't forget! Belle and Sebastian @ X-Tra ZH next Wednesday 13.04.11 Perfect indie pop - herbaceous borders, foxes, cups of tea etc etc            
Filter are phenomenal live, I saw them at a festival when Richard Patrick got nailed in the head with waterbottle. Didn't miss a beat right at the corus of 'Hey Man Nice Shot'.   
Crowd went berzerk! Sick mosh pit. I never knew 'Take a Picture' could be such a heavy song.   
Gonna hit up this show up for sure.
		 
			
			José González & The Göteborg String Theory are playing tomorrow (Friday 8th April) at Salzhaus Winterthur.       
Anyone else going as well?
		   Ben Howard is playing at the Caribana Festival in Crans-près-Céligny on 11th June:           Has anyone been to this small Festival?

I feel like some music        
Concert is tonight. Should be really good       
			
			Dirty Dozen Brass Band from New Orleans plays at Moods tomorrow.  I'll be there.
		 
			
			Tuesday July 5th    - X-tra     
			
			I heard that next thursday Beardyman is playing @ Stall6 for around 20CHF. If you get the chance check out his essential mix from this year (or last..... can't remember...). Basically beat-box's the entire thing while looping over himself beat-boxing.    
Its like the musical form of Inception
		 
			
			Slash plays JUL 13th at the KOmplex 
Rise Against plays Aug 23rd at the xtra 
Josh Groban plays at the KKL Luzern Oct 06 th
		   , Luzern, doors open at 22:00 tonight. 4 bands, no work tomorrow.

			Architecture in Helsinki playing Kaserne in Basel on Easter Sunday night.

Line Up Friday:                                                             
Already have my tickets for friday.             How was it? I wanted to go but didn't want to put up with the pain of getting back to Zürich - I had things to do on Saturday.
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this before but Raul Midon will be playing in Zurich at Moods on 10th May. Tickets available   priced at CHF38.   
This guy is brilliant        
			
			Atari Teenage Riot are playing at Salzhaus, Winterthur, 21.05.11           
Minus a member, right?
		    Yeah there's just 3 of them on tour - Alec Empire, Nic Endo, and MC CX KiDTRONiK, I think. Carl Crack OD'd in 2001.
		 
			
			Sheffield band   are playing @ Stall 6, ZH next Wednesday 18.05.11         (ps. I've got some free tix if anyone wants them, check the 'Free Stuff' section)   
			
			Holy Sh!t!   
Wilco are coming to Basel on 7th November - playing the Kaserne   
Also the Wild Beasts are playing on the river in Basel on 11th August.   
Awesome!!!
		 
			
			Cat's Eyes (Faris Badwan of The Horrors, and Canadian opera singer Rachel Zeffira) are playing at Hafenkneipe, ZH, on Thursday 26.05.11, kind of dark girl group pop with goth undertones. Watch their debut performance at the Vatican (of all places!):       
			
			anyone else going to einstürzende neubauten tomorrow and on thursday in lausanne? i'm SO looking forward to it! if i manage to get there in time that is...   
			
			A while away yet, but awesome Kiwi band   are playing at Abart, ZH, Thurs. 08 September 2011. I saw them at the m4m festival this year and they almost blew the roof off Exil.
		 
			
			Cut Copy + Architecture in Helsinki @ Stall 6, ZH, 28.06.11 - so I will get to see AiH this year after all    
			
			Grandmaster Flash at Stall 6, Zürich, Saturday May 28, 22.00
		    Getting back home was the expected long, drawn-out, sleepy saga, but it was worth it. Cinema-gig with the band sitting on stage in front of the screen, ripping into their instruments, while videos played behind, it was pretty unique. The band hung around before and after and had beers with the masses too, nice blokes.
		 
			
			DJ Shadow at Komplex Zurich on 04.06   
and Arcade Fire at Montreux Jazz Festival on 10th July!!          I try and go every year, will be there all 4 days this time. If you like old school 90s hip hop they usually have a big name one evening or another. The rest is either French Pop / Reggae (so many hippies in NE) / usually decent electro and some kids singer on the Sunday afternoon which is when the families are there.    
  It was really crowded last year, I hope it'll be better organised (more bars, less VIP space) so getting drinks doesn't take half an hour. There's load of benches and what not so sit down on and it's by the lakeside so you can smoke by the rocks if you want. Thing of it as a Fete Des Vendanges you have to pay an entrance to and that has decent music. Well worth it... so long as it doesn't rain too much, but most of the place is covered by tents anyway.
		 
			
			Too bad I am not here!  
The  in Winterthur (15 min by train from Zürich!) is on in June, they have concerts from June 10-12th.               
ENJOY         playing Zürich 30th June
		 
			
			Anyone wanna join me in the Rote Fabrik to see Slim Cessna's Auto Club. Some band members from 16 Horsepower, in the theme of American folkrock, kinda.       
			
			Simian Mobile Disco playing Nordstern in Basel on Friday night and Cut Copy playing Hinterhof on 29th. Really looking forward to both.
		 
			
			CEREMONY is playing on the 28th of july in Dynamo in Zürich:       
Together with: 
LA DISPUTE 
TOUCHE AMORE 
DEATH IS NOT GLAMOROUS
		 
			
			...and still far ahead, but KVELERTAK is playing in the Abart in Zürich on the 1st of december:       
Together with:   
TOXIC HOLOCAUST 
TRAP THEM 
WOLVES LIKE US
		 
			
			Destroyer is playing Rote Fabrik on the 24th of June. His last album out-80s the 80s, and if the live show is anywhere near as batshit-bizarre as this video, it should be interesting.       
			
			Lenny Kravitz  at the Hallenstadion Nov.26 th  
Flogging Molly at the Komplex 457 Nov.17 th 
The Kooks at Komplex 457 Oct.26 th
		 
			
			the Cat Empire are playing at Komplex on the 12th November (tix on sale on the 29th June)
		    Yes - did I miss it?     
Can't believe I've only just found this thread    
			
			Just got back from seeing Filter at Abart. It was AWESOME! It's quite surreal seeing bands that I grew up listening to.  Back in the Republic of South Africa, it's a dream come true to see bands like this.  I'm very grateful to be able to have these experiences and see these band that I admire and really love.
		 
			
			Sebadoh at Abart in Zürich on August the 15th. Grungey!       
			
			Just happened to notice Fleet Foxes are playing at Komplex 457 on 21.11...some way off yet I know! As much as I like their albums I'm not sure about seeing them live - anyone seen them before?
		 
			
			^ I haven't seen Fleet Foxes before, but I'll be there.   
also, awesome aussies cloud control are playing at hafenkneipe 19.09.11. great band, lovely people.
		    Not quite my thing but very good live, I've heard.
		 
			
			Switzerland has its fair share of good gigs!!!      always has a good line up.   
And the Red Hot Chili Peppers are playing in Zurich before they even come to the UK!!!! Dec 13th at Hallenstadion!
		 
			
			The Dub Pistols are playing in Fribourg tomorrow night, 2nd July, as part of Fribourg Jazz Parade. Don't really know much about them, but sound right up my street.          Generally regarded as having given a very weak performance at Glasto last weekend.
		 
			
			Manic Street Preachers are playing at the Winterthurer Musikfestwochen on Sunday 28.08.11:          @ Plaza, ZH, 01.11.11. Tickets  .
		 
			
			11.10.2011 - Beady Eye @ Volkshaus, Zurich 
Tickets are going on sale tomorrow ( )
		 
			
			Not Zürich but definately worth the trip - The Antlers play St. Gallen 3rd December.
		 
			
			Some bands work much better in a venue then at a festival. Actually most bands do.       
			
			Hi we're just moving down from Lux in Sept and in the past few weeks have seen Foals, PJ Harvey - Prince played here etc etc. There is a good music scene here and it's advertised of 2 main websites, is that the case in Zurich or Switz as a rule? 
Thanks
		    Arse - back in the UK then. The last album was a corker .... back to the old form
		    Sunday August 14 - Zofingen - Heitere Open Air Festival
		    It's ok. There's a lot of bands that don't come. As Far as I'm aware PJ and Foals have never been.
		    PJ plays Paleo I believe, this weekend. And I'll miss her       Tickets available on ricardo if you want them.    
I'm just going to pretend that I meant Zürich.
		    Nope ... Foals played at Abart last year. Zurich is not that bad after all       I didn't say i was bad, just ok! I'll revise my opinion when Radiohead come and play on their next tour.
		    damn, only one Swiss date??    
Will you be seeing them on the UK leg of their tour DP?
		    I am going to see them in Hastings.  Just a few minutes walk from my house

			Friendly Fires @ Abart 28th Sept:    
Not seen them before but they have some good live reviews from this year, and Abart is a nice little venue.
		 
			
			aug 9 - dillinger escape plan at bad bonn (dudingen) 
aug 12 - meshuggah, the ocean, +more at rock altitude festival (le locle)         
			
			Zurich: Wednesday 17th August   
PRINCE!!       
There are no more standing tickets left from ^ that ticket link, but I found mine from a UK website
		 
			
			The concert from prince in cologne arena was absolut rubbish, he played 
one song, left the stage for 50 mins, returned for anonther 65 mins and left 
early after a total of 75 mins played, some people payed about 150 euros for a seat.         That's a shame. He's usually one of the best live acts out there (imo) 
I hope he'll not be doing the same in Zurich
		 
			
			Friendly Fires will definitely be worth a look....   
Sadly I won't be able to make it - but I recommend   (Abart, 8th Sept)
		 
			
			City and Colour @ Exil in Zürich, 01.10.2011 19:30, CHF 28.-

			Hip-hop pioneers Jungle Brothers are playing at Stall 6 next Thursday 01 September 2011:         I've got 2x2 tix to give away, if anyone is interested? http://wp.me/pLHpb-1bW

			The Melvins @ The Rote Fabrik 8th October 2011
		     
Was just about to buy tickets....then realized, i won't be here. Damn!
		 
			
			Great baltimore duo Wye oak are playing at Fri-Son, Fribourg 10.11.11 (sadly no ZH show   )              they're playing geneva too on the 7th. thanks for the heads up.
		     
Saw them a couple of years ago at that very spot.  Was very, very loud, we got very drunk, one mate got into a fight in the mosh pit and was almost thrown out, another ended up sleeping under a mattress in a squat somewhere in Zurich.
		 
			
			I'd like to recommend the songkick.com website, it's brilliant. 
It scans your iTunes library or you can quickly and easily choose the interests that interest you as well as the cities and you have a personalized calendar and receive emails when concerts of interest are announced.

			Not so much a Heads-up, more of an ""Oh Bollocks"", but did anyone catch the Buzzcocks in Aarau last Saturday? Any good? I missed it as I was in the UK.        Saw them last year when the played Zug OpenAir (free festival) it was nice to say I'd seen them but tbh they were nothing special at all.

			For all you Vaud jazzers,   is coming to Chorus, Lausanne, 15 October 201, with his Migration band.  This is a musician/drummer not to be missed if you can make the gig.  Reservations will be necessary, I am sure.   
Antonio has many projects, but those of you in the know will recognize him as Pat Metheny's drummer in his PMG (Pat Metheny Group), the drummer since 2003.       
This is a big musician coming to Lausanne.

			Perhaps this could be interesting for some people: the people from the Kilbi festival in Düdingen/Bad Bonn will launch something like a   in winter - 9th/10th December in Exil (and Moods) Zurich.   
Particularly looking forward to Glenn Branca Ensemble and Thurston Moore. It's a little pricey (85.- for both days), though it's worth it for me.
		    presents  .   
The concert will be held on  at  , at   in Burgweg 7, 4058 Basel.   
You can buy tickets for 24 CHF through  ,  , at SBB and Post. Or you can buy it at the venue for 26 CHF from 21h on the night of the gig.   
The concert itself starts at 22h, but there will be a party at around midnight with DJ Edin and DJ Bob Rock playing Balkan/electro music.   
Kultur Shock plays some sort of Balkan music/rock/metal/punk fusion, and they are particularly good live. Well see for yourselves:       
and the same track live at exitfest 2010 in Novi Sad, Serbia:       
Great huh?! }:-) 
See you there!
		 
			
			Don't forget: British Sea Power are playing at the Abart, ZH this Wednesday 12.10.11. They had to cancel their ZH show twice before, so fingers crossed they'll make it this time!           
			
			pretty much my reaction too, with an few choice expletives thrown in though. I did regain my composure long enough to selflessly post it here, thinking it might help some deserving music fan out that way catch them.          Good concert, though I was pretty drunk. Place seemed to empty by the end of the gig, shame really, but as their last album was their worst so far then I'm not surprised.

			Saharan blues from Tinariwen at Kaufleuten in Zurich on Saturday 15th October. If you've not heard them live and like riddim then it's the concert for you. A major influence on so many records recently.   
I happen to have two tickets for this show for sale at cost price  .

			The Italian electro-rock band   is visiting Basel.   
The gig is starting at 21h on 30th of October in Grenzwert bar (Rheingasse 3, in Kleinbasel).      to their profile with more of their work.   
And a small glimpse on what you might expecting a few weeks:     
So if you feel like changing your Swiss routine, you can start by going out on Sunday evenings as well. }:-)   
See you there!

Dropkick Murphys , Feb 04 th Komplex 457 , Zurich
		    We rarely read reviews after the event on this thread, so I'll keep it brief: It was very good   Support act François & The Atlas Mountains had some interesting beats but strange, Eno-esque dance moves, which were a bit theatrical, but in all very West Coast French dance melancholia. Anna Calvi's voice is a joy to hear. Nuff said.   
Oh Hai GastroGnome! I tried to grab ya but you had more beauties surrounding you than I did, so I didn't want to steal your thunder       I was there too! I'll be writing a review soon (on my blog, though, will post a link), just haven't had a moment. We should do a meet up at the next suitable gig, what do you think?

			A bumper week for music in ZH next week! Obviously getting to all of them may involve some kind of cloning technology   but here are my tips:       
			
			I'd love to say The Kills were great last night, but due to the   sound at X-tra, it's hard to say.    
Not the first time either - I'm not going to waste my hard earned on that venue anymore.
		     Were you upstairs or downstairs?   
I find if you are right in the middle upstairs the sound is not so bad.

			Sisters of mercy (chf 55) and its at xtra in zurich. Date 23rd November 2011   
I've got a spare ticket for the above   
If you're interested please pm me
		 
			
			looking forward for the sisters of mercy tomorrow and on thursday! can't believe i have never seen them before!    
next days' schedule:     
tomorrow: work, drive to zürich, gig, drive back 
thursday: train to lausanne, work, gig, sleep 
friday: drive back, work 
saturday: drive to zürich, vive la fete gig 
sunday: drive back, probably spend day on sofa 
monday: work, drive to zürich, fakir's gig, drive back ?   
why do all the bands chose to play at the same time and almost never in bern??
		    I was bang in the middle, about a foot behind the sound desk. Logically I would have thought the best place for sound in the venue...       yes,that is normally the best spot  . Try upstairs next time if you can.
		    price negotiable, if anyone is interested
		    mhm, the last time when there was paul kalkbrenner, sound was fine?!  
same with belle & sebastian and morcheeba.
		 
			
			sisters of mercy gig at the xtra was pretty good but the sound quality was terrible, more due to xtra than the sisters. not the first time a gig has been ruined for me at the xtra due to useless sound quality
		 
			
			Right, don0t know what the problem there is. The second half of the gig was much better.          Skindred are an awesome band - saw them at Download a couple of years back.  DK Murphies are a must see too - saw them in boston last year.
		 
			
			anyone going to any of these?   
the horrors - tomorrow night 
smashing pumpkins - next fri 2nd dec 
dEUS - next sat 3rd dec 
thurston moore - sat after 10th dec   
im new to town (zurich) but will be headinbg to these gigs, so feel free to say hi!   
(especially if you know where i can buy vimto...)
		 
			
			I'll be at the Horrors tonight, gimme a shout if you want to meet up. I know of a few Asian stores in Oerlikon which sell Vimeo that I can give you directions for ^^
		 
			
			sounds good       i'll most probably be at the dEUS one! and also at dEUS in neuchatel on the 6th     
thurston moore, i thought i was going but it's on the same date as FAQ's gig in Aarau   
and i think i'm probably going there, as the partying will surely be better!    
i had some friends seeing smashing pumpkins in london a few weeks ago and they were very disappointed (and they are pretty big fans). so i'm not going (to be fair, i wouldn't go anyway as i'm not crazy about them)   
we seem to like similar music, so feel free to come and say hi tomorrow at Fakir's show in kaffi für dich (details a few posts above).
		 
			
			Hi Crimson, I'll see I will see about monday night, tho i tend to work late at the moment. I'll def be at dEUS tho, my fav band! That should be ace. it woul dbe good to go to the show on the 6th as well but, work!   
Shame to hear your friends didnt like the pumpkins recently, i had friends at copenhagen, manchester and london gigs and they were nothing but loving the shows. they are the band that usually suprise me most at shows with how amazing they are, but i shall see!
		 
			
			i hope you will enjoy the sp show! let us know!    
dEUS are perfect. every time i see them i can't get over how great they are. and they are not even my favourite band! (but amongst the top ones anyway)

The Musical Box is a highly professional canadian Genesis tribute band. They bring the early Genesis years - when Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett were still in the band - back to life. They recreate their vintage shows as original as possible. The sounds, the sights, the costumes, the lights, the everything. They are very approved by the original band. Phil Collins even played a show or two with them. This time they will play the ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"" show in its entirety. It's rumoured that original Genesis guitarist   will join them for the encores!

hoo.   
CHF300.- gone. just. like. that.                  I've got tickets for wilco, earth, bruce springsteen and mastodon. I am thinking of seeing the tindersticks (brilliant in geneva in 2010, good in zurich in 2011) and lambchop. I saw lambchop a few years ago in the rote fabrik and they were dreadful, the band was sloppy, the crowd got bored and people started to go home. they must have had a fight because there was lots of banter between them which didn't involve the audience. this was promoting the damaged album.
		    I was at that gig: it was US Independence Day. Talking backstage with them during the interval Kurt and MacManus were talking about being TourBlind: it was getting tired and no longer personal. They wanted to be with their families, especially on that night. After a peace pipe, they came back on and played some haunting stuff, which many didn't enjoy, as you note. The banter was down to, er, the pipe, me thinks.   
Crap jokes were still crap, though. Can't wait to see them again.

		    Sounds like a good idea, this thread isn't a good way of organising social events.
		 
			
			News from the ""Winterthurer Musikfestwochen"":   
Headliners on August 24th:     Franz Ferdinand   
Headliners on August 26th:     Flogging Molly     
			
			The   lineup is pretty damn good, especially the Saturday: Afghan Whigs, Mudhoney, and Lee Ranaldo.      Canadians Unit!      is playing at Parterre in Basel on April 7th!   
For anyone who hasn't heard this Canadian gem, they are highly acclaimed and having seen them in concert back in Manitoba, they are amazing live.           Hello and welcome to the Forum. You can post concert events on the mysteriously invisible*   or under   ( if you're a promoter or financially involved).   
Putting a concert / event on the calendar gives it greater exposure and allows for some 'buzz' (is this what the kids call it these days?).   
Also, you can set up a  . This particular thread can be hard work to get overview, so lead from the front!   
*Must look into why it doesn't show under the Events icon    
			
			this is a 'wee bit early but if there are any Diana Krall fans out there she will be playing Lucerne in November ( she just sent me an email to let me know )    
and hopefully there will be a couple more Swiss dates showing up.       
			
			AND.............   
any Pink Martini fans... ??    
they  (+/- China Forbes ? ) will be performing at the Verbier Festival 01August    
( tickets for this and all Verbier festival events just went on sale at noontime today )           
( EDIT... got my tickets confirmed.. row two seats 38-40.... just off center ... hope the people in the front row don''t wear frou-frou hats )

I'll check if I am free then - I would love to see them again.       Thanks for the heads up Prof. That weekend looks good for me so far, same as above, will check and see.    
Reggae...   
			
			The Concerts calendar is now added to the Events menu - thanks Editor Bob.    
As it's tricky getting overview of posts made in this thread perhaps consider adding a concert to the concerts calendar if you intend going as this may encourage others and it'll build our social opportunities.    
Lambchop play Kaufleuten in Zurich tonight. As I'm not attending - sad - I won't post it on the calendar, but were I to be going...   
Keep on rockin' in the free world.
		 
			
			I tried to add the concert to concert calendar but it says :   , you do not have permission to access this page."" 
where do i get the permission ?   
			
			As I understand it you need to make ten posts beforehand although it's such a dusty corner of the Forum I'm not sure. Have another try once your post count reaches 10...
		 
			
			Live at Sunset (in Zurich Jul 11 to Jul 22 there will play BB King, Elton John, Roxette and more) 
Moon and Stars (Locarno Jul 05 to Jul 13 there will play Lenny Kravitz, Status

			on June 4. Tickets now on sale.    
			
			On the 12th of April RISE AND FALL (Deathwish records, frietcore) is playing in Gaswerk in Winterthur, together with OATHBREAKER and THE SECRET.          at Le Romandie were fantastic last night, Dylan Carlson is incredibly charismatic. They were ably supported by O Paon and Mount Eeerie.
		 
			
			Tickets now on sale for   on September 28.
		 
			
			Looking forward to not going to that one then ....
		    It'd be a great opportunity to give him the finger.          
			
			This is one of those times I feel embarrassed to be Canadian.
		 
			
			MAZZY STAR is playing in the Rote Fabrik in Zürich on the 18th of July         MOD EDIT: Nickelback thread merged   
I have never met an actual fan of this band.   
I'm sure they have some, but are probably too embarrassed to admit it. I don't blame them.
		   They've sold over 50 million albums, allegedly
		 
			
			I've been wanting to see Mazzy Star for years but alas I'm on holiday that day!
		 
			
			the song about the panties down by the ankles is cringeworthy
		    The same fans that think Bon Jovi are a great ""heavy metal band"" or ""Survivor"" and ""Europe"" kick ass.*           (*Um, they don't ....)   
			
			here's a great video with all the wikipedia 'updates' on Nickelback over the years.     
Some are very informative and amusing            
I guess I'll be dancing alone then           Canada has enough awesome music.    
Nickelback is just the Canadian reaction to Creed.
		 
			
			Dropkick Murphys will play Jun 12 th in Prattteln , Z 7
		    Ah wow, they'll have to play this song wouldn't you think. It's my wife and my song... Ahhhhhh Jüüüüüüüüüü

			Talking of idiots.........     
This coming Saturday   
Demented Are Go & The Hillbilly Moon Explosion at Kammgarn in Schaffhausen               
			
			the official ""leaked"" schedule for Montreux Jazz...       
( I'm not overwhelmed personally )
		 
			
			Looking forward to RPWL at the Galery Music Bar in Pratteln this evening:       
Although the Z-7 crew are promoting and selling tickets, the venue is the Galery just down the road, not the Z-7 black hall.   
RPWL started life as a Pink Floyd covers band, but they've had their own progressive style for more than a decade now, their latest CD ""Beyond Man and Time"" is very good melodic rock.
		    I'd go just to see Janelle Monae. She's amazing
		    I like the line-up but can't understand why it's called Montreux ""Jazz"". Been to Cully last weekend, much jazzier there and a fantastic atmosphere.
		 
			
			Would love to see Tony Bennett but tickets are very expensive
		    I guess it's kind of hard to change the name midride.... and much of nowadays music is influenced by jazz (the good stuff at least)
		 
			
			Eagles of Death Metal are playing in Solothurn on the 21st of June.           
Nothing remarkably new or mindblowingly good, but never fail to entertain live. I'd go just to see Jesse Hughes do his little dance.
		 
			
			I have a spare ticket for ""The Slackers"" (SKA), Thursday April 26th, Zürich, Dynamo. Please PM me if you want it, it'll only cost a beer.       
			
			Paleo   released and some interesting choices   
The Cure, Lenny, Manu Chao, Sting, & Guetta among others

He Wore A Haaaat 
I Miss Yoooooou 
Why Did You Leeeeeeeeave Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...""       
Saw him a few years ago at the wonderful bastion of downtown bohemia El Lokal, but almost fell asleep. He has a massive following but somehow he's lost his bite.    
Chicks dig him though, so see you there.
		    Definitely a victim of his own prolificacy.   
He is my beard mentor though, I'll be heading along for some ad hoc trimming tips.
		    MOLOTOV will also play in Winterthur, Salzhaus,

			Graveyard,  from Sweden will be here to blow a few cobwebs away  in the Mascotte -  11 December 2012

			Django Django play Zurich's Rote Fabrik, 27th November.

is playing in Zürich on Wednesday September 5th at the X-tra. 
Tickets are on sale at   for a WHOPPING 78,60 plus the print at home fee makes it an 80 CHF ticket... I don't get why they charge us to print out the ticket at home.. that should be free right?   
			
			Quite a treat: starting on Friday, 16th November at the Reitschule in Bern is the   festival, celebrating 15 years of Constellation Records. Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Do Make Say Think, and A Silver Mt. Zion, amongst others.       Godspeed also in Zürich's Rote Fabrik for 35chf    
Can't wait! Although I've never seen them live so I have no idea what to expect...

			The Tindersticks ( ) and the Maccabees ( ) are playing in Fri-Son in November. Don't realy know a great deal about either band, but will have a butchers at YouTube and might pop along to one or the other.   
Edit: Sorry, had wrong dates.
		          The Tindersticks are a brilliant band, check out their second album with this cover (   and Curtains:   
The music is melancholic, moody, orchestral   
They can be brilliant live especially when they have their string and horn sections in tow.   
I fully recommmend them and good luck!
		    Thanks for the heads-up on this @Crumbs.  Can't wait!    
			
			What is it with the XTRA venue in Zürich?The sound quality is truly dreadful. I have seen several live bands there and I have always noticed the poor sound quality. Only the supremely organized or very loud acts seem to be able to overcome the poor sound quality of this venue.
		 
			
			Thanks PaddyG, I've been wanting to see the Maccabees for years :-). Seen Tindersticks, not really my bag.       
			
			I'll be going to:

			I've got tickets for Fleetwood Mac on 13-10-2013 at the (wretched) Hallenstadion in Zurich and I'm really excited about seeing Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie and the two lucky guys
		    There have been rumours about (no pun intended  ) that Christine McVie may also appear on the tour
		    I'm glad to hear it but I thought she'd retired completely, she really has to sing her songs, Stevie Nicks has too country a voice to sing Christine's songs imho. I'm also really looking forward to seeing Buckingham, a seriously underrated guitarist, play

They are appearing at Z7 in Pratteln on May 9th.     
This as a trailer to their debut album 'Dimensionaut'.  It should appeal to all prog. rock fans.          Thanks for the heads up. Saw them last night at the Stadthalle in Sursee. It was just like it would be to see the real Pink Floyd playing in a high school basketball gym. Fantastic!

I'm finally going to get to see one of my favourite bands!    
			
			Nouvelle Vague play Kaserne in Basel on 2nd October. I have my tickets :-)           
btw what did you think of the gig? I wasn't impressed, I saw her last year in Geneva and she way way better
		    strange, i was also last year in geneva and did not enjoy it very much. i thought she was in a bad mood, whereas in zürich she was in a good mood   
i really liked the one in zürich and the one in montreux a couple of weeks later. still have the songs in my head. gotta love her.
		    i'm going as well! and to another place they're playing, could it be geneva? (yes too lazy to check)    
i've seen them live a few times already and i'm always impressed by the energy they bring on stage. much better than the cds in my opinion. you will love it!
		    Oh! I thought I might be the only one from here that would be interested. Maybe with the exception of Prof T.   
I saw Red Sky Coven a few years ago, but haven't managed NMA yet. Really looking forward to it.
		    exciting, isn't it?   see you there!    
			
			Fat Freddy's Drop, in Zurich 21st October

			I'm hoping for a fun night out rather musical masterpieces.        
			
			For country fans, Band Perry will be in concert in Zurich at   on the 23rd of November.  Warm-up acts (not listed here) are:  Easton Corbin and a a dynamite guitar player from Canada, Lindsay Ell (her mentor was Randy Bachman of BTO).
		 
			
			I don't get the nouvelle vague love, for me its money for old rope.
		    well, some versions have a bit of fresh new paint to it or sound interesting though i am not a big fan. just got a ticket from a friend, so i just 'been there'. what i like about them is the nice singing voice of the girl that wasnt there at kaufleuten and therefor (sorry, lou) were rather like a fly buzzing around my head...
		 
			
			vive la fete are playing in bern this coming saturday. woop!        
			
			Hi guys, been lucky enough to follow some of the greatest bands around just before they ""made it"" (luck and friends, not me). Went to see this Swiss band absolutely amazing and a brilliant punctuation to my move to Sydney. I think Domi should be big and I mean BIG       This got good around the five minute mark.  Sounds like what would happen if you put Thom Yorke and the XX in the same room.
		    Really cool music but my god what a shocking voice. They really need a new singer...        You have a good point...Not everyone can be this guy:       
			
			Anyone going to see Lucero on September 18?
		    I gotta see her live one of these days, can't believe I have missed her so many times. Did she do Nude on the News?
		    nope, unfortunately! according to my catpower expert boyfriend (and kind of friend of hers) she refuses to play it
		    I can't have too much of her all the time, a bit too dramatic but Nude on the News is one of my all time favs, really. She is so spontaneous and talented. I hung with folks who went to see her a lot in Atlanta.
		    i cannot have too much of her at once as well. but i like her more and more as the years go by
		 
			
			So I went to see Nouvelle Vague on Wednesday night, the sound quality of the band was not so good but the singing was perfectly fine and the entertainment factor was excellent. Over all a great night out and a lot of fun; I would go and see them again.           maybe because her song is called Nude as the News... see! Catpower loves me more than you!    
			
			After skipping out on most of the festival scene this summer, I'm excited to see The Dirty Head and the iconic Sublime (with Rome) on Nov. 12 at Haerterei. Great show for those who enjoy the punk/ska/reggae cali scene.           
			
			Rude Zone Festival at Dynamo, Zurich, November 1st:

CHF28.-          plays Exil, Thurs. 14th Nov, CHF25.-         play the Rote Fabrik, 20:30, Thurs 21st Nov. CHF30.-        play the Rote Fabrik, Weds 20th Nov. 20:30 CHF25.- - an absolute snip!          plays the Rote Fabrik, Thurs. 5th. Dec 20:30 CHF25.-

		    Bad bonn kilbi is the best featival ever! In the middle of nowhere....highly recommended! I cannot go this year (getting married that weekend) but i cannot stress enough what a cool festival it is! 
Ps: if you go make sure to walk to the nearby lake and enjoy the beauty of thr scenery
		     
oh wow The Black Angels too! AND Mac Demarco!
		 
			
			Just seen the line up for Monteux Jazz 2015 and I don't think there is any artist that particularly stands out.  Perhaps they are keeping the best for next year as it will be the 50th one       
			
			thanks for the heads up, some good acts playing like Ibeyi, Foxygen, The Staves, Portishead, Sophie Hunger, Lionel Richie, Kronos Quartet, James Blake, Sly and Robbie, Anna Calvi, Alt J, Santana, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, George Benson,  etc etc   
but some serious crap as well, there is very little quality control going on these days
		 
			
			i'd also recommend dEUS and asaf avidan
		    I missed this, I love the Sleaford Mods!   
Otherwise a weak line up. I saw Thurston Moore with Sonic Youth at BKB a few years ago and they were lame. Highlight were the mighty Sunn O)))   
@crimson, I fully agree BKB is a great festival with a great vibe
		 
			
			Thurston Moore solo, I would go see. It is different, especially if he is in the mood.    
dEus is amazing. And James Blake.    
I want to see all that       Thurston Moore has different moods? How can one tell?
		    The left corner of his lips is about 2mm above the right one?   
I know    
But I do like drony stuff that washes over. There's certain poetry in a wall of noise.    
Which reminds me, completely unrelated, I gotta wish for a uke for my bday that is coming up    
			
			Ed Sheeran - is he back anytime soon?
		 
			
			Upcoming in Zurigo:

29.05: Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Mascotte (surely no need to introduce them?)        anyway, they are a good band - very indie, if they come round again worth the trip.
		 
			
			Ezra Furman plays in Zurich tonight at Bogen F, 21:00.
		   play in Zurich at the  , 8th February.        
			
			I love them. ""Up with People"".   
Ezra Furman and his ""My Zero"" is MiniMC's ultimately fav song.
		    Doh! its the Missus's Birthday, oh well, I will just say its a surprise       Lambchop play Geneva the night before the Zurich gig; they play Luzern the night after.    
Ezra was ok the other night but the crowd seemed more happy to be there than enjoy being there, but that's the Swiss concert experience. He seemed tired.
		    I find that infuriating, in Zürich its about being seen at a concert but with absolutely no interest in the music! I am always telling people to stfu especially during quieter songs, when it seems the gig becomes a social gathering. The amount of times I have heard performers saying something about that during a performance, I don't think the Zürich audience gets it!    
			
			sooooo true....
		 
			
			Great thread. Any hint of U2 coming back...sadly passed us by last time (from a fans point of view that is).
		    It will be better when people start caring more for content than form. Being seen may also translate as liking the music, privately, you cannot expect a discrete culture all of a sudden show authentic affection in a prestigeous environment. The fact that the musicians and loads of listeners do not consider it prestigeous (the partisan opposite) is irrelevant.    
Les Grottes are great; in GE. Anti prestigeous. Weird enough stuff.
		    Lead from the front: dancing and enjoying yourself is the perfect way to get your square metre of space and will encourage the others. I was, however, told off by a woman once at a Nicolas Jaar gig for dancing. I apologised and told her next time I wanted to have fun I'd stay at home and listen on my headphones. Some just can't abide happiness in others.
		     
Hahahah. I am used to lead from the stage   , the best kind of hedonistic leadership.    
Well - I agree with you. There are places that support actual fun. And I also think that people do not dance for the same reason other stuff doesn't get done here, worried about spontaneity/authenticity being perceived as impolite, rude.    
I dance when I feel like it. Gigs, classrooms, balet halls, tents. I think the stiffness will change. A buddy of mine went to headphones party (4 diff music channels), she had to look for somebody dancing to the same stuff. Fun. And some rooms had no light. Gasp! Puritanism is on its way out of life.

(And you will know us by the) Trail of Dead  - Sunday May 10th at Mascotte.   
Greenday - November 8th Hallenstadion.
		 
			
			Well here goes....    
For chitter and chatter about gigs up and coming to run along side the wonderfully implemented calendar events and for the numpty simpletons like me who prefer the old fashioned way      
hopefully this will replace Jot's great 'Zurich Gig Guide' from the past - but will please all the unfortunate bumpkins that live outside the canton of Zurich    
			
			Why is it that some people have so much difficulty dealing with change?   
IMO This thread is pointless and selfish.
		 
			
			I was sure I was going to get groans for that and they will all be from people living in or around Zürich...   
When in real life a small group of people sharing the same interests (for example Zürich inhabitants, blondes, Audi TT owners, whatever...) joins up with a bigger group (for example Switzerland inhabitants, ladies who like to dye their hair, Audi owners...), you can then tell them a 1000 times that it doesn't make sense them staying together in their small group, that they should open up to the other people...If they don't want to change they won't.
		    well then go to this   instead? we cater for all    
			
			Primal Scream Xtra 16 th August.
		    Are you going Annie and Nicky? We may have to re-arrange my schedule a bit so we can go because they are good live.
		 
			
			We are Nigel, booked our tickets today.
		    Not sure yet - not listened to any of their recent stuff
		 
			
			The latest album is really good. Check out the website    
We now have tickets as well.       
I am also wondering about the Delilahs at Kaufleuten on 13th August.
		    Don't you think that there are Primal Scream fans living outside of Zurich?
		    Primal Scream are playing in Zurich therefore it is a 'Zurich Gig' - I created another thread to post gigs in Switzerland should anyone wish to....
		    Grrr.... 
Zurich is in Switzerland.
		    Why don't we have ""Yawn"" button as well as Thanks & Groan?
		 
			
			Well you all found this thread about Primal Scream playing in Zurich so whats the fuss.      PS I dont live in Zurich Kanton.      I found it because I actually live in Zurich and am registered to this thread.   
But why should a Primal Scream fan who does not live in Zurich have to wade through 10 pages of Zurich concerts to discover that his favourite band is going to play in Switzerland?   
If you want to keep this thread fair enough but please also add the events to the Concerts Calendar!
		    Who let you in? Anyways, this thread is far more pointless and selfish, it's only for Zurich Stadt       True but we should also have a ""This poster is being selfish"" button that would be worth 10 groans.
		    Why register to something that seems to cause you so much angst    
Anyone only using this ""Heads Up"" thread or the EF concert guide is going to miss out on plenty of things they might like anyway. It contains a mere fraction of what is going on. Compare it to a comprehensive gig guide eg   ,   etc   
Real gig guides exists elsewhere, so I certainly can't be bothered replicating them on EF. Call me selfish if you must, but it only caters for those who like to be.....       
			
			We have the Concert Calendar, we also have the Zurich Gig Guide thread and the Switzerland Gig Guide thread - is this not enough?    
Martin if you want to add Primal Scream into the calendar then go ahead - Mannie Organ decided to post it here and that is entirely her choice but it does not stop you creating an event   
After the demise of the Zurich gig guide some people (me included) missed having a general thread to chat about and mention up and coming gigs.   
I am sure people living elsewhere can still look at at this thread if they see a new post added to it - especially if they are interested in music and are willing to travel - if someone decided to create a Basel Gig Guide I would follow it, just because i Live in Zurich doesn't mean i wouldn't be interested in gigs in other cities   
where's the flogging a dead horse icon for this bleedin topic......
		 
			
			Martin - you groaned Mannie Organ for merely posting a gig that is happening in Zurich in the Zurich Gigs ""heads Up"" thread, do you really believe that deserves a groan? as far as she is aware she is posting in the right place... really some people.....
		    The difference between the EF concerts calendar and a general events website is that the concerts mentioned on here are focused towards the expat community.    
According to your reasoning if information that was already available on the Internet should not be added to the EF then there wouldn't be much content on the EF.   
What I don't understand is why you can't create a Primal Scream Concert thread on the calendar for the 16th August and then have your discussion there: ""Are you going?"", ""No I am going on holiday"", ""Pity because Primal Scream are good"" etc... ?
		    Go for it Martin, very happy for you to go and post the event in the calendar, jeeze I'll do it if it will make you happy?
		    No I groaned at her because she knows of a good concert that could interest other expats but decided not to add it to the Calendar.
		    everytime this thread gets bumped to the top, i think there's a new concert...       I posted it in the Zurich thread because the bloody concert is in Zurich,end of story.          Most of the gigs I go to are with Swiss people. They have remarkably the same taste in music as ""expats"". EF is intended to be a ""Community portal for English-speaking people in Switzerland"", not an expat ghetto.      People do often refer to outside web sources. The real value of EF is in the info that isn't so easy to find, and peoples experience and opinions.      I've not been overwhelmed by the volume of your contributions to this calendar (was it zero or nil?). It's a bit rich to be handing out tit-for-tat groans to contributors and using that as an excuse.
		    That is the whole point of my groan. If you post your comments and information somewhere in the middle of a gigantic Zurich Concerts thread it will not be easy to find.
		     gigantic one and a bit pages.
		    Exactly the problem, and not exactly unexpected.  That is why I wonder why there are mutliple gig threads.  It serves no purpose other than to keep those in Zurich happy and the rest of the board uninformed.
		 
			
			I give up.      see everyone uses things differently, I prefer this way rather than the concerts calendar, the gig is posted and then if no one adds a comment to that event then it gets lost in the pile - whereas I see a new gig added to this and it appears in 'new posts', if i decide i want to go to the event mentioned I put it in my own calendar, I find this solution easier, however i appreciate that you don't, we can't please everyone and I think it will just have to be give and take   
If in the future you see a gig mentioned on this or the other thread and you want to create an event in the concerts calendar then go ahead but don't groan at people if they have chosen this method if that's what THEY prefer   
Nicky
		    For the moment but by August it would theoretically be longer.
		    It's a conspiracy for sure.   
Magnolia Electric Co.  25 Sept  El Lokal , Z*****
		    And why not post it to the general concerts thread?  Do you specificaly not want others to know about it?  Or do you feel too many concerts go on in the rest of the country that it would be lost?
		    Cyrus I didn't post it in here but I actually advised Mannie Organ to post it in here so yes slapped wrist - but it is actually a Zurich concert, not exclusive to Zurichers but it is happening in Zurich - the thread exists and it seemed a suitable place   
I think you are being a bit pedantic over this... is it really all that important? a gig is happening in Zurich and it was posted in the Zurich Gigs 'Heads Up' thread       It is pedantic, but it's not just me being pedantic is it?  I just feel everyone is better of with a general concert thread, but those from Zurich can't seem to post their concerts to a thread that doesn't have the word ""Zurich"" in it.
		    I think 'those' from Zurich can (if they want) Mannie Organ isn't even bloody from Zurich she posted it here because the event is IN Zurich, quite a logical decision do you not think, when confronted with 2 threads, one called Switzerland Gig Guide and the other Zurich Gigs ""heads up""    
Basically don't blame the messenger, it's the mods decision what to do with the two threads and so far they have been left as they are, so...... a user comes along and posts a zurich gig in the zurich gig thread and she gets groaned and hassled about it       
			
			Ok, to summarise:   
There was a Zurich Concerts thread, people weren't happy and made a General concerts thread. Then people weren't happy because gigs in their area were getting lost in the big General concerts thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... People still weren't happy so there was a Concerts forum created.    
People still weren't happy because they could only discuss a particular concert in a thread, so there was a Zurich concerts thread... then the non Zurich people got pissed off...     
FFS people, no one is going to be happy all the time. Its not the end of the world, get off your high horses (Did Hsiang ever find out where to procure one?) and go to whatever concerts you want to. If a gig is in Zurich why can't the people that live in Zurich discuss it in a Zurich based thread. If they were going to go to a gig in Luzern I'm sure they wouldn't object to it being in a Luzern gigs thread.    
I think a certain amount of ""cop the f**K on"" is needed here.
		    Actually the old Zurich concert threads served well for all concerts in the country, because most concerts happen in Zurich, there were no other threads.  I thought a title change would be appropriate to reflect the actual content of the thread, but obviously, that was just too much.
		    Well then you should have left well enough alone and not tried to fix what was not broken.       But why on earth do you guys have to have these general threads why not simply create an individual thread for each concert and discuss the specifics there.   
That was Nathu's aim when he created the Concerts calendar.   
This reminds of procedural language programmers who couldn't understand object-oriented programming: Now every concert is one object.
		    Because maybe they don't want to!   
You are still perfectly entitled to post the concert in the concerts thread should you so desire.
		 
			
			It's annoying me now how I bang on about it, I understand how some people prefer a single thread and some like the events, but I simply cannot understand why we have 2 seperate stickies simply confusing the issue.     
All gigs posted here will be in Switzerland, most will be in Zurich, why is it so hard to not have a single thread with a title that accurately reflects the contents ""Upcoming Concerts"" or some such, then acts will be picked up by all who might not otherwise consider a trip out of town.  Instead we have 2 threads, or one thread with an inaccurate title.
		 
			
			Now that 50% of the dissenters have annoyed themselves, can we move to the next part of this thread cycle please?   
Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism -> thread users discuss thread -> long period of silence -> thread users think it safe -> Zurich gig posted -> thread users discuss music -> martin34 & cyrus crack the sh1ts over regionalism ->
		 
			
			Er, I support the use of the Concerts Calendar - which should be merged with the main calendar IMO; let's have a huge 'What's On' section with overview - rather than having lots of different threads.   
There was some arcane rule about not posting an event on the calendar if you weren't intending to attend; surely that's not necessary? Should there be a concert, is it not easier to have it on the calendar? One concert has no relevence to any other and threads like this spin outta control... although something is better than nothing.   
And it's Zürchers, not Zürichers       Oh yes, above it all aren't we? but can't possibly post to a concerts thread without Zurich being in the title.
		 
			
			right i have to dash off to catch a flight very shortly but as an interim would it make everyone happy if I merge this thread with the Switzerland Gig Guide thread and just have the one thread from now on    
The Zurich guide i really don't think was created intentionally to p!ss off Cyrus and Martin but it seems to have done anyway and I think they'll be banging on about it until the cows come home, so I'll merge and we'll just have one generic thread - which will eliminate their the 'them and us' belief   
Agreed?
		 
			
			Right threads merged - it's all a bit of a jumble - i will attempt to edit it when i get chance
		 
			
			I was going to post earlier, but it felt a little childish   
For fans of electro pop, the excellent   are coming to CH   
Stall 6, Zurich, 2/6 and 
Volkshaus, Basel on 3/6
		    Can I now be picky and ask for it to be renamed ""Switzerland Gigs ""Heads Up"" or ""Switzerland Gigs Discussion"" or ""Switzerland Rough Gig Guide""? Cos it aint a gig guide.
		    ah it could have gone in the other thread    
			
			eskimo joe(super aussie band) are playing Bier Huebli in Bern on the 27th October.             
I'm going. anyone from Zurich feel like grabbing a train to Bern check them out?   
(to avoid a sh!t fight based re: the usual argument: Zurich vs rest of the known universe, if someone feels like popping this on the gig-calendar please feel free. i don't know how. :-) )   
they will also be at Gurten for those who are going   
cheers

			MUSE playing the Hallenstadion in Zurich - Nov 18th... 
Tickets on sale as of today       You've made my day!
		 
			
			B*llocks only seating left!!
		 
			
			Yeah, I think that its because you were only allowed to buy the tickets when they were released if you were a VIP member of ticketcorner.com. Totally sucks as now all the 'ticket dregs' are left. Anyhow, I managed to buy 2 tickets for the UK so will be seeing them there.    
			
			Someone wants to come?           
Thats gonna be my first concert here! Great start    
			
			I wouldn't mind going to see Gossip tonight at Kaufleuten, but they sold out at starticket, does anyone know if they sell tickets on the door?   
I don't want to travel all the way to Zurich and find I can't get in.
		 
			
			A bit short notice but, tonight I can completely recommend both of the bands that will be playing in the restaurant, if it rains, or just outside on the terrace if it doesn't, at the Rote Fabrik. The bands are, in no particular order, Sein and Attwenga. 
Thankyou for your time.

			Wilco play the Volkshaus on November 11th, tickets from CHF55.-   
Peaches plays 8th September, from CHF55.-   
Goran Bregovic also plays there 23rd April, 2010 ( ) from CHF65.-
		    play the Club at the Theater Spektakel in Zürich Tuesday 18th August, bringing some spooky Ethiopean jazz grooves to the shores of the lake of Zurich. If you weren't in Addis Ababa before 1974, you'll know their music from the Jim Jarmusch film 'Broken Flowers'    
Fire        
			
			This used to work much better when it was a single thread called Zurich Gig Guide 2009 in social events.                      play the Mascotte in Zurich again on December 5th. They're also supporting Muse at the Hallenstadion on November 18th. A good show       It doesn't work because you aren't using the system correctly.
		 
			
			Martin he is using the system how he would like to use it - please quit with groans because someone disagrees with you.   
There are many who no longer benefit from the new system me included - I know a lot of time and effort went into creating the concerts calendar but i feel it is not as effective as the handy gig guide thread we had before. I am finding out about less gigs now because people are just not posting them. It's quick and easy to post on here and many people are short of time and don't wish to create an event.   
So please, we know you don't like this method, but we don't like the other method so can we be grown up and not groan the users who would like to carry on down this route?   
Bannahead thanks for those 3 updates - I am sure in the old system these would have been announced sooner so I hope there are still tickets left for Temper Trap   
Cheers  
Nicky
		    ...It's not that we don't wish to creat an event, but we're following previous rules asking us not to create events if we don't intend / sure if we're going. This is a ""Heads Up"" thread.   
On that note, the rather loud and rocking  play the Rote Fabrik this coming Sunday 20th. Last time they played there were about 7 people in the Ziegel; one was a waiter, one at the bar, two groupies and me and my two mates   A private party!    
There're really quite good, despite the crowds...
		    I agree UM this is why i don't use this calendar event because a) I am unsociable and don't want a crowd tagging along with me at a gig   and b) sometimes I find out about a gig want to tell others but may not be going myself   
I just don't want to get into the whole gigs head up guide v concerts calendar debate again - there was no happy outcome the last time so why can't each person just do as they wish and post a gig ho they want?    
I like this method and it worked for many years and was updated regularly - at least 2 to 3 times a week a new gig would be posted on here and it was always my most favourote thread, it's now died a death and it's a shame    
			
			I haven't posted because I haven't seen anything I liked, it's been quiet over summer.   
Here's a couple to get the thread started again.   
25.10 Micachu and the Shapes / The Invisibles, Zukunft, Zurich   
12.11 Passion Pit, Alte Borse, Zurich   
20.11 The Field, Palace, St. Gallen   
25.11 Massive Attack, Eishalle Deutweg Winterthur   
3.12 Punks Jump Up, Hive, Zurich   
5.12 The Heavy, Palace, St. Gallen
		 
			
			Massive Attack, even antisocial me might be interested in that.       And where do I fit in to that description? I'm still fearful of crossing paths with the FOTL boys after the death look they gave me for buying a bottle of wine at the counter, it was for DaveA I tells ya! Don't think we'll see the likes of a FOTL & Black Mountain ""restaurant"" gig again soon   
Anyways here is my heads up, El Lokal to the rescue in October with varying shades of classy Americana in one hell of a week:   
Oct 18 - Mark Eitzel (American Music Club) 
Oct 22 - Joseph Arthur (last time I saw him was supporting R.E.M.) 
Oct 25 - Richmond Fontaine (Uncut Magazine's favourite story tellers)
		    Oh boy oh boy, Good work, El Lokal       Palace in St Gallen is a very good venue. Dont be scared to stand in front of the ""seat"" people though.        This is your opinion. And you are wrong.   
Along with Nicky, I do not want to reopen the whole Zurich Gig Guide versus Calendar discussion because it got boring very quickly. However, I will not be posting any events         
Sadly I won't be able to attend The XX gig and I am mightily disappointed.
		     
I like the recent albums but I'm not sure how it will work live.
		 
			
			Camera Obscura - 13th Oct - Abart, Zurich

			It's a good week for indie music in Zürich with Au Revoir Simone on Tuesday and Yacht last night (which was great!).   
This evening Girls are playing at Exil.   
They have an interesting personal history, having grown up in the Children of God cult, being heavily involved with drugs and being adopted by a billionaire . . . or something.   
The music is psychedelic, influenced by the Beach Boys and shoegaze.
		 
			
			Who are the ""Girls"" ?     
as you can imagine, googling is pointless ... what do I google? Girls in Zurich, Girls group, Girls music ...
		 
			
			Anyone interested in seeing Alice In Chains in Fribourg start of december?   
A bit of a different band from their Grunge days, could be interesting
		    Well I did explain a little bit in my original post . . .   
More here:          If only I noticed earlier      
The debut album - imaginatively titled Album - is in the post   
Did you go? Were they good?       
And now for a plug          Unfortunately they started at 11.30 which was a bit late for a school night, so I decided against it.   
In other news . . . Patrick Wolf is playing at Mascotte on Wednesday. Anyone going? Or want to go? If you are it would be nice to meet up . . . PM me.       
			
			FYI - for any Aussies out there Eskimo Joe is playing tonight in Bern at the Bier Huebli

			It would seem that The Joy Formidable are supporting The Temper Trap.   
Check out the video here      
How can you not love this band.
		 
			
			for the U2 fans out there, heard that they'll be playing in zurich next summer... can anyone confirm?
		   I'm looking forward to see KING AUTOMATIC at the longstreet bar 4.11.09 @2100h
Now that is something worth going to see..       I watched their video, what a bunch of w@nkers!
		    Not definitively but I can say the stage diagrams /architect plans have been drawn up (see  ), permission for a concert at Dubendorf Airfield has been granted, and I would expect a concert date sometime in the first half of September 2010 to be announced in the next week or two.
		 
			
			...are playing at the Volkhaus on 28.01.10...(I know I know, that's ages away, but being in CH...)   
I think tickets are around CHF50 , but you'll get excellent riffage for your frank, and the support is sure to be good....       
You know it makes sense!
		 
			
			Looking forward to the Temper trap in a few weeks. Got a few mates coming. Anyone interested in meeting up, PM me
		 
			
			Ian Brown is playing at Abart in Zurich on the 18th January. Tickets are now available.   
Should be a great gig if he manages to keep out of trouble with the dibble between now and then.
		 
			
			I just hope that he doesn't get bottled like  the last time he played Rohstofflager.   
Ian went offstage for a break, the roadies were switching out the Fender guitars and bringing the Gretsches onstage. This suggests the likelihood of an encore filled with Stone Roses songs. He wasn't offstage for more than 3 minutes and the idiots behind started throwing filled cups of beer towards the stage, coating us in the front row and the instruments on stage. They were asked to stop, but the continued. The lights came on the, the roadies got all the gear off stage and the Ian didn't come back on to play an encore that would have included a bunch of Roses tracks   , (as indicated on the setlist i collected)   
I really hope the Abart crowd are a bit more sensible.               is playing at the Salzhaus in Winterthur on Sunday, 22 Nov 2009   
And me sadly up in Germany...

		    Naughty Hendricks!   
It'sh Exil . . .       
			
			for those going to Temper Trap on the 2nd Dec - the venue has been changed to the Abart
		 
			
			Living End - what a gig man!!!    
AWESOME !!
		    YEA - it was an amazing show!!! And I liked how the venue was really stretched to it's limit, with a crowd surfer almost kicking down a ceiling-mounted stage light and with the bass literally lifting the roof

			The Temper Trap is playing at Abart Zurich on 2nd. December. 
Is anyone going as well?
		 
			
			Wow just listened to some Youtube vids (Science of Fear, Sweet Disposition and Fader) and they are pretty damn awesome, in fact very awesome, I really like the sound.   
Abart is 50m from my apartment too. Very tempted, will talk to my friend and look at tickets tommorrow. Thanks for the heads-up man.    
			
			You're welcome. Love Abart as it's a smaller venue AND it has a Bar    
			
			got the tickets as soon as i saw they are in CH. really looking forward to seeing them..
		 
			
			Also already secured my tickets for Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten on 22. February. He's amazing live and it will sell-out really fast. Just to give everyone the head's up.      Same here. Should be rad.    
And yep Xaiver Rudd is a go-a in December. Will bet tickets asap
		 
			
			I'll be there at Temper trap - looking forward to it - shame they changed the venue though
		    Thanks for the heads up...I would've turned up at hafenkneipe blissfully unaware that they had changed the venue otherwise. Oh well, bang goes my 3 minute walk...   
Should be an awesome gig though, can't wait to see them live.
		    ...and bang it goes to Richdog. Abarte is at the end of my street.    
Really looking forward to the gig, booking tickets tommorrow.       But Xavier Rudd is in February next year not December?
		 
			
			oops my bad. May miss it cause i'll be in Australia either feb or march
		 
			
			Biffy Clyro is playing at Mascotte in Zurich this Saturday. 
Also for those who have missed it, Editors are playing at X-tra in Zurich with support by the Maccabees! Should be a great gig.
		    Its annoying that one,we are booked for the editors,but would have really liked to see Biffy Clyro.
		 
			
			Same here. Difficult choices      me too - they supported Muse but really we were so far away and as usual the sound is rubbish in Hallenstadion and especially for the support acts. Would have been good to see them in a smaller venue   
see you Sat Mrs O
		 
			
			see you in the bar.
		 
			
			Just seen Filastine is playing at exil in Zurich tomorrow (Friday).  Think that might be mighty interesting.
		     
4th February   at abart   
10th March   at rohstofflager
		    She must have liked it here last time!
		 
			
			David Grey for anyone interested   
X-tra 7th Feb
		    I missed both these on their first visit, hopefully get to see them both on their second
		    Cool i might be keen for that
		 
			
			Gentleman & the Evolution are playing at Maag Event Hall in Zurich on 20th April 2010. Bit far off but tickets will sell fast.    
Gentleman is pretty amazing live!
		 
			
			John Butler Trio coming April 25th 2010 at Maag MusicHall AG  
unfortunately i'll be on a plane to Oz then    
Venue phone: 044 444 26 26.  
Pre-Sale Tix on sale 16th December 10AM
		 
			
			Jase you just made my day!   
I love John Butler Trio, saw them live at Gurten Festival.  
Will get my tickets asap     
Another heads up:   
RJD2 is playing in Bern in May.       
			
			12 March, Zurich, Volkshaus -    bringing his upcoming   work.   
Brothers and sisters in true music, this gig is a keeper of keepers.  I have heard some tasters from the CD, read reviews from in the know people who I trust with their musical opinions, and it promises to be a deep human  , esp. in these obtuse times on the planet earth.  And believe me I have seen Pat Metheny many times (more than any other artist perhaps including Joe Zawinul in the same company) since 1978, so this is full-hearted endorsement.   
If you saw   tour of 1992, and   in 2005, then this tour has the potential to outpass these two extra dimensional gigs.  Metheny is a musician/composer/human being for our times and for all times.   
Here's a neat interview with Metheny       Is RJD2 playing his low tech hip hop stuff (ie. since we last spoke/Dead ringer) or his indie singer-songwriter stuff? cause im not so found of his new direction.   
Edit: Also keen to check out DJ Vadim on Feb 5th if anyones going
		 
			
			Jose james, Kaufleuten Zurich 10th March.
		     
Or Florence      
In other news.   
Blood Red Shoes have a new album in March and they are coming to Abart on 29th March.    
			
			Dans le sac vs Scroobius pip play at Sudpol, Luzern 28th Jan.       
For those of you who haven't heard of them before, well worth a listen.    
There are also sections of spoken word from ""Scroobius pip""        
tickets are only 30.00   
Should be a great show
		    They played at Hafenkneipe in Zürich last year.  They must like it here.
		 
			
			Date: Sa 6.2.2010, 20.30 - Moods  im Schiffbau, Zurich.       
Featuring drummer Grant Calvin Weston of  .
		 
			
			Hi there. 
AIR is coming to Zürich on 3rd Feb.  
Does anyone like this band? 
I would like to meet people going to the concert?   
Cheers
		 
			
			Thanks for the James Blood Ulmer tip nice!   
I have tickets for the great Element Of Crime next week but i heard its sold out.
		 
			
			Hey people   
sorry for the last minute question, but is anyone going to the concert of Angélique Kidjo in Kaufleuten on Saturday? I'll be there with 2 friends and thought it would be a good ocassion to meet some of you     =   
All the best 
Roxana
		 
			
			Ooh, I love her.    
Will let you know if I make it   .
		    will be in Zurich (Hallenstadion), on Sunday, the  .
		 
			
			The gorgeous   will be in Zurich (Hallenstadion) on Monday, the  !   
Although it's on a Monday  , I'll definitely see her       will be in Zurich (Kaufleuten) on Tuesday, the  !   
Would love to see her... too bad that it's so far and on a Tuesday       will take place from the 7th to the 10th of April in Crans Montana (Valais).   
The program is available here:       
I've never been so far but I might go there on the Friday evening.   and   should be interesting.       I love air but not sure how much tickets are. I thought theyd be expensive because they're crazy popular in Australia
		 
			
			Btw: Does anyone know where I can get tickets to the Stall6 gigs? Im trying to find DJ Vadim tickets online but it seems to be the biggest run around
		    I think you can just email   to reserve tickets . . .
		 
			
			cheers mate
		 
			
			The Blood Arm are playing in Albani Club, Winterthur on 23rd Feb and Bar 59, Luzern 24th. I have seen this band twice in London, and they put on the most entertaining shows of any band I have ever seen.    
Go see them!   
(And if anybody is going to be driving to either one from the Grindelwald area, please let me know...)       Great!!! I'll be there...  Tickets available at:    
(40chf  )
		    Bar 59 is a cool little spot, might go check them out.     
La Roux is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, on the 7th March.
		    Damn, apparently it's sold out.  Anyone want rid of their tickets?
		    Do Kaufleuten normally have additional tickets on the door?
		    Don't know, but would like to find out.
		 
			
			More gigs I would like to go to (but need to work out if I can get back from Zurich on a school night  ):   
Hockey 16 Feb 10 Abart     
Vampire Weekend, May 28 2008   Zurich <-- so errr ignore that, as it's way out of date (Thanks bananahead for spotting!)
		     
Hey Kirsty, you do realise that it is 2010 this year?                 
But they were good    
			
			hmm thanks for pointing out my stupidity... but I would have liked to go! This was my vain search for bands I really like playing in Switzerland, and I turned up... 2   And one of those was 2 years ago! (It said past performances in teeny tiny writing - you can't blame me for getting over excited and missing that!)   
Harumph, so just hockey then...
		     
Hi there, 
You can buy them in Ticket corner,  they are 60.60 CHF general entrance, 
it is not that expensive. 
Are you going? 
Alex
		    The missus might be sorting tickets atm. Will let you know if we are
		    Hockey is ausverkauf.   
I'm not sure if they will have tickets on the door at Abart.
		 
			
			Muse are playing at Stad de Suisee in Bern on 2nd June 10   
Hope i manage to get standing tickets this time

			Kitsuné faves Two Door Cinema Club are playing on January 27th at Ziegel au Lac.       
			
			Coming 27 Jan to the D! Club,   - the one and the only   for a  !!!!  Can not make it for professional commitments in other parts of the continent, but it promises to be da BOMBE.  Such a precocious talent.  A voice and presence        
Check out this clip from 1995 in London.  Whatever you do please stay in your seat...........!!!!!!!!!!       
			
			infected mushroom are playing feb 13 @      
they always seem to be changing style, better than being stagnant I guess, and I'll probably go check it out
		     
I thought he went by the name of Senanda Maitreye these days?   
P.S to save others searching the D Club location as I just did   it's in Lausanne
		 
			
			As a heads up, we actually have a concerts calendar as an option on the main forum calendar. It's somewhat lost because one has to scroll down and change the options to see it - we're working on simplifying this - but  anyway. As these lists get longer and longer, perhaps it'd be useful for others to know from the calendar if you're intending to go. It'll allow a bit of buzz for the event and let others know who's attending.
		     
Nicky, he sure has but thought to put his former name out to those who remember him from 1987 when he came out with  rby album, and several others after until he changed his name to Sananda Maitreya in 2001.   
My bad, I put Lausanne in the Title block but not in the main text!   
Anybody been to the D! Club in, of course, Lausanne?   
			
			Terrence Trent Darby used to be on my wall as a teenager, would love to see him if he did his hold stuff, alas Lausanne a bit too far..
		 
			
			I think I might go to this.    
Will just have to stay up all night and get the first train home  .
		 
			
			Nicky n Natasha   
I think he will play some of the older charts and newer ones too.   
Maybe he is on tour and coming to your area?  I had no idea about this Lausanne gig until I read it in   this Saturday morning.   
Or if you would like a very nice youth hostel near the lake in Lausanne here it is.  Highly recommended and very reasonably priced.  Think 39 chf room with breakfast       
			
			Recently discovered  covering concerts in Switzerland (landlockedblues). May be of interest to see who's around and get the er, skinny. (Is that right? Skinny? Is that still in?)
		 
			
			Deep Purple have you seen this?            
Nat. Sportcenter, Huttwil

			Just seen Trentemoeller is at Hive club tomorrow night (13th)
		 
			
			New Young Pony Club at Hive club on 26th April.       
			
			Woot woot!  Hockey at Abart tomorrow.   
It's total ausverkauf, but it might be worth turning up to get tickets on the door.
		 
			
			Tindersticks are playing Kaufleuten, Zurich on May 5th.   
Miserable feckers. Great live.
		 
			
			It looks like tickets are available on the door for Hockey.   
Doors open at 7.30 . . .
		 
			
			There's a free gig tonight at   by  .   
It starts at 22.00       
			
			The White Lies gig for tonight has been cancelled.   
""Dearest fans. Charles from White Lies here. Im am so so sorry to say that we have to cancel tomorrows show in Munich and the following day in Zurich because Harry has picked up a very nasty viral infection which has destroyed his voice. He's seen doctors from various parts of Europe over the last few days and overdosed on every steroid/anti-inflamatory and pain-killer we could get hold of. But it hasn't worked and today we had to come off stage in Vienna after only 3 songs. We're so sad to have to re-schedule these two shows once again. We had been looking forward to them since December. Please be assured that we will still play these shows for you as soon as we finish the next album and by then have exclusive new songs for you. Love from us all. C W/L""       
(Credit to Dan for spotting this!)
		   are playing at Moods in Zürich as part of the M4Music festival. Saturday, 27th March at 23.00   
Goody goody
		 
			
			anyone going to Xavier Rudd at Kaufleuten tonight?
		    A definite Yes!!!       Me, too, me too!
		    Hadouken are a good live act. Noisy fun.   
Very polite young chaps too.   
Here are some photos I took when I saw them in London in 2008:           
			
			Eminem, Jay-Z, Fantastischen Vier, Jan Delay, Stress,...whole bunch others:   
Frauenfeld-weekend of the 9th July.
		 
			
			Gogol Bordello on May 26th in Zurich:       
I unfortunately will be out of town.  
I've seen them once before in concert and they are absolutely amazing....
		 
			
			Faithless are coming to Zurich!    
April 27th at Vilkshaus       
			
			R Kelly will be in Basel the 3rd of April:          Lock up your 15 year old daughters!    
			
			Right, bought my John Butler Trio Tickets for 25th April. 
Can't wait!! Anyone know who support band is?
		 
			
			Benga comes to Bern on the 3rd of April at Reitschule.   
Haven't yet been to a pure dubstep night, this seems like one to go for.  Might be my first night out in Bern too.
		 
			
			Mos Def 24th April at Rote Fabrik. Have put an event in the  .
		 
			
			The Reverend Horton Heat (USA),  Fr 02.04.2010, Zurich       
highly recommended. i've seen them 3 times and if it were not for the concert being in zurich, i'd be there again.    
			
			Damn, sometime I miss living in Zurich...Les Claypool at the Abart club on 10 March.        
			
			Pink Martini a the Kaufleuten 15th July     
			
			and Cat Empire at Schutzenhaus Uetliberg, Zürich           
I guess the title of his tour (""Ladies make some noise"") tells it all    
			
			An hip hop event during Easter in Zurich. It will be the fisrt edition.   
Method Man, The Beatnuts, De la Soul, IAM, Diam's, Hocus Pocus and more performing between the 2nd of April and the 4th of April.             
Imogen Heap is playing tommorow night at Abart, I think tickets are still available.   
			
			I almost bought tickets for      =   
but I'm not sure.    
Opinion anyone?
		 
			
			Posting on behalf of a friend of mine, he organises Stoner rock bands to come over here.  Rock isn't normally my thing but I've hugely enjoyed every concert he put on.   
Locations are either Sedel or the Blues Bar, both in Luzern.  Sedel is the old womens prison, just outside of town, Blues Bar is a tiny room at the back of a latin nightclub, just past schuur.               
			
			Ash are playing Abart on 25th May     
Last time I went to see them was at the University of London Union...seem to remember the night ended up with me drinking Snakebite and Blacks, whilst arm wrestling students...not quite had a similar experience in Switzerland so far...
		 
			
			The Strokes, Stone Temple Pilots, Billy Talent, LCD Soundsystem, NOFX, Wolfmother, 30 Seconds to Mars, White Lies, Kasabian:   
24-27 June, St Gallen.   
Gonna be a rough weekend!
		    Yeah . . . especially without any decent bands        
*GROAN*   
sorry DJ Bobo wasn't available, he's kinda hard to get a hold of this time of the year
		    Well, I'd probably give LCD Soundsystem the time of day . . .   
And I note that The Strokes have a new album out in 2010.   
Not the freshest line up though, is it?
		 
			
			Yeah, I'm really going for the Strokes and STP (and I have a gulity pleasure for Billy Talent too, but I'm in therapy for it).   
The rest will just be cool filler, perhaps some surprises.
		 
			
			Huge Euro festivals suck. Small festivals suck harder. It's all a big con to get us to consume more product. Bring back touring.
		    What you want is small 'conference' festivals in towns:  SXSW, Stag and Dagger, The Great Escape
		    What I want is a seven foot blond chick with natural curves and green eyes who'll turn into a pizza at 3am, but I appreciate your sentiment.
		    Certain to be available at all the above events, if you do them right.
		    Ahhh I saw Ash at the Astoria last year. It was great. I will try and get along to this one. It's a school night though    
Happy memories of ULU... They used to do the best nachos to go with your snakebite!
		 
			
			I've seen Ash 3 or 4 times at various stages of their career and they have yet to be less than awesome   Best time was in a little venue in Hastings and Silver Sun were the support.   
Ah, Silver Sun - their debut album was fantastic!!
		 
			
			Saxon - Z7 - Thursdsay night.
		 
			
			Blood Red Shoes at Abart on March 29th          Indeed           
Looking forward to it lots.
		    please tell your friend to send some of these bands to lausanne...      concert cancelled !!!
		 
			
			The Moon and Stars' festival (in Locarno) programme is available:       
Too bad that Locarno is that far!!!   
I hope that JK will give another concert elswhere in Switzerland       Would go to see LCD, STP and Wolfmo but the FREAKIN World Cup is on, priorities priorities.    
I see the Gurten has Faith No More headlining - enough said. Wont be going to see that rubbish again.
		    They'll be showing all the matches from big screens so it won't be that you'll have to miss anything....btw Mike Patton is GOD!
		    To be honest its the WorldCup, I need to be comfortable when Im watching the Greatest Show on Earth!   
Hmmm MP is a deity huh... The Real Thing is their seminal album granted, in fact I still regularly listen to it, but their material got progressively Pattonised (weird and experimental in want of actual music) culminating in the God awful Mr Bungle. Discuss...
		     
I don't know how I can discuss such ignorance politely    
Different strokes I suppose and if you prefer the Mike Patton that sings Lionel Richie covers then so be it... I guess I couldn't interest you in his work with John Zorn then       No need to be polite, we are discussing Patton after all. Angel Dust was after The Real Thing, and about the time I started to loose interest. Jizzlobber was the last straw. Terrible.
		 
			
			I for one am stoked to see FNM headlining the Gurten Festival!!!    
btw...   
epic < angel dust < king for a day < album  of the year   
tomahawk is also awesome.   
peeping tom is really good too.    
mr bungle and fantomas are acquired tastes but absolutely incredible live.
		     
what's a world cup?         
Sorry, not my thing
		    Unfortunately this world cup is not played with sticks so guess your national team didnt qualify, u could always support the USA       He does a great job, I'll post them up in events shortly, but if you'e a big fan of any of the bands, it'd worth the trip to Luzern.  Both venues are very small and you get right up close to the band.
		 
			
			Soccer world cup? I know what id rather do..... Anything. But then again I'll watch anything when im loaded   
Anyone going to this M4 music thingo tomorrow? Keen to see Jose Gonzalez again. Last time I saw him the sound was awful and it was a horrible setup
		    Jeff Beck!
		    yeah but in support of ZZ Top? ewww....      
but i will say tho that Jeff Beck was amazing at Montreux Jazz Festival a couple years ago. probably my favorite guitarist evah!    
			
			FYI Paleo Festival has announced their lineup....meh           
besides Iggy & the Stooges & Indochine... meh indeed
		    Two Door Cinema Club and We Have Band are worth seeing.   
Foals are very definitely worth seeing . . . amazing live performers.  Klaxons too.   
I'll happily dance to Vitalic and Yuksek.   
N*E*R*D pretty good live too.
		    So I can see what snazzy dressers they are? Sorry, generic ""indie"" music bores me nowadays. Good point about N.E.R.D. & Vitalic though.
		    There's a big difference between TDCC and something like Coldplay or the Kooks.  There's electronica and afro-pop in there.  Yes, they're snappy dressers, but that's part of the deal if you sign to Kitsuné.  Not sure how they'd come across on a festival stage though.
		     
Which they stole from Vampire Weekend, who stole it from Paul Simon, who stole it from Fela Kuti. Shame he's dead now...
		    . . .  who stole it from someone else in Africa . . . etc etc blah blah blah   
You think there's a chance of completely ahistoric music with no antecedents?  And that bands shouldn't use some of the same sounds and influences?  TTCM fall some way in between Vampire Weekend and Foals, but have their own sound.  Vampire Weekend are more preppy/New England.  Foals miss out the Afro-pop, but have some of the same kind of indie-dance and free range guitar.
		    meh indeed
		   26.05.2010: Foals @ Abart, Zurich  
Tickets are available from    
			
			Port O'Brien playing in Zurich, Basel and Luzern this weekend. I have seen them in Dublin before and they were great live! Recommend.   
Hopefully they will still make it despite volcano issues!
		 
			
			Stevie Wonder at Moon and Stars on 7th July.
		 
			
			Crystal Castles at rohstofflager, Zürich on the 27th April, might try and make that.
		    play the Idaplatzfest in Zurich, 21st August, showcasing their second album      Perhaps      playing this Friday night at 8pm at Kaufleuten Zurich.
		 
			
			Not sure if it's already pegged in here, but The Eels are playing in Winterthur on August 28th, supported by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  Tix are 54 CHF from Starticket.   
Also the night before, Paolo Nutini is playing the same spot.   
Looks like an open air music week in old town Winterthur, should be cool. (Events already created for both in the Concerts calendar)
		 
			
			I've created a social event in the calendar for the Tunng gig on Wednesday.
		 
			
			this looks promising:        
at least for friday night.       What is it about the Swiss and Skunk Ananse?? 
Every other country got tired of them in weeks!   
The Eels looks promising!
		     
When you figure that out please explain to me their fascination with Amy Macdonald.   
It's just Eels btw, no ""the""
		     Cool, miss living there.
		    Anyone fancy it, or already going?
		    Er . . . that was last night wasn't it?
		    May, no?   
(too short)
		    Ooops . . .  I am living in the future!     (Yes . . . there are flying cars here and everything)   
			
			This looks good, an open-air festival for Zurich at long last.  i'll be there for Underworld and Booka Shade.  I'll try for Placebo but tradition dictates I turn up right at the end of their encore...          I've posted an event for this:       
			
			Bump for the Tindersticks playing at Kaufleuten tonight. Anyone else in?
		 
			
			Jimi Tenor and Tony Allen at the Kaserne tonight (8/5/10). Tony Allen was the band leader for Fela Kuti, but his solo stuff since then is less of the traditional afrobeat. Fans of experimental rock and jazz should check it out!
		 
			
			They obviously like it here     
mo. 29.11. -  - abart
		   Mike Patton's Mondo Cane   Thursday , 29.07.2010   20h00  Luzern (CH)  KKL Luzern - Konzertsaal    
			
			A.R Rahman concert 
Hallenstadion Zurich 
16 July        thanks for posting. that would be a VERY interesting show to see.    
but it seems like most concert announcements just make me realize i'm on the wrong side of switzerland.       Foals were amazing last night.  Tracks from the second album are generally more contemplative than those from the first and therefore less appropriate for a live performance.  The old/new split was about 70/30.  It's just incredible the way the band plays together . . . precise but intensely passionate.  Many times throughout the gig I just went 'wow'.  The final song, 'One Step, Two Step' left the crowd on a high.
		 
			
			not sure if anyone has posted it yet, but Slash is touring his new album in June. He's playing X-tra on the 16th of June. Miles Kennedy is on vocal duties.   
from what i've read they are playing a healthy mix of tracks from Slashs' back catalogue and the new stuff.  i'm really looking forward to this one.           
			
			Another overlooked festival, just saw a poster for it...Neuchatel Open Air.   
Cypress Hill! Looks like a nice location too.        
			
			What about the   in Lucerne   
Shame about the name.... I think its for the sexually frustrated
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this but....      - Abart, Monday 5th July, CHF35   
Fo sho!
		    Oh how gutted i was to hear this was on the 5th July, the day i go on holiday! VERY gutted
		    damn have my mother here from Oz that week. Might take her with us    
			
			Almost missed this one, John Garcia plays Kyuss at Schuur tonight (2nd June), Luzern.
		 
			
			i'm going to see them tomorrow in lausanne. i didn't bother posting coz i really didn't think there was anyone here interested.   
should i also mention baroness is playing in fribourg in july? my new favorite band.    
			
			A band I know will be playing Thu, June 10 in Stall 6. 
African Percussions and a singer from Gambia.

			The Kissaway Trail the highlight (for me) of this year's For Noise festival in Pully (near Lausanne).       
			
			I'm surprised no one has mentioned Prince in Geneva on 12 July.        
			
			Not sure if this has already been mentioned   
29th Sept Hallenstadion    
I am so there!   
Tickets for ticket corner members went on sale today, general public tomorrow I think, many pre sales tickets already sold out so get up early tomorrow folks    
			
			Say what now? I thought I knew you! interwebz-wise.       stick with me Debz and i'll show you the way    
come on who can not be a Peter Gabriel fan?
		             
anyone born after 1980       Phil Collins fans?
		 
			
			anyone coming to Bsides festival today?
		 
			
			Possibly, keeping an eye on the weather.
		    Damn . . . didn't spot that.  Not sure if I can come now.   
Three Trapped Tigers are excellent.
		 
			
			Hmmmm . . . Crystal Fighters are playing at the Imagine Festival in Basel tomorrow.       
Am I right in thinking this is free?   
Anyone else going?
		     
it is free, might be going.
		 
			
			I've already booked and paid for my Guns n Roses tickets.   
Geneva, 16th September at the Arena (beside the Airport)
		 
			
			I'm probably a bit slow off the mark, but Mumford and Sons are playing (with Sophie Hunger) the Montreux JF on 14th July. Tickets are note available on the ticketcorner site but, unlike other, it is not marked as sold out on the Montreux site.   
I'm also very tempted by Julian Casablancas with Vampire Weekend but at 80.- it's a bit steep. There are tickets available for that though.   
Does anyone know where else I might be able to get tickets? I can get to Montreux to buy them next week if this is necessary...   
Merci d'avance!
		 
			
			More rock at Sedel, Luzern.   
July 2nd 
Yawning Man   
July 4th 
Mondo Generator   
July 8th 
Valient Thorr
		 
			
			Devendra Banhart is playing Kaufleuten, Zurich, Tuesday July 13th. Tickets from        
			
			Its not a Swiss gig so please don't shoot me down but we are off Wed to Belgium to what I reckon is the BEST open air festival in the world.....   
Werchter Festival is so damn well organised and has a solid line up every year. Just 8 hours drive. You can't beat it peoples.   
ROCKONAUSTRALIA !!!        decent festival but Primavera destroys all
		 
			
			careful with your ears, folks.    
my last concert, john garcia plays kyuss, might be my last concert.    
since then, i have tinnitus. BAD. this sucks.    
i will post up some tinnitus info at some point but please take care of your ears.

		    Nice!  I may have to think about this... haven't had my fill of weird yet this year.    One of my all-time favorites:   
[maybe this should be in song of the day...]   
But on a Tuesday?!? Come on!   
EDIT: Anyone here planning to go?  I am so up for it but pretty sure my roomie wouldn't be interested...
		 
			
			Baby was a black sheep, baby was a whore. Baby got big but she's gonna get bigger..... Anyone going to see Patti Smith in the Rote Fabrik on Wednesday? 
I really hope she only plays old songs, but it's not too far to walk home if she does.
		 
			
			here's an 'under-the-radar' festival...in grandson VD...          Oh man, missed that and probably can't go now.   
Love this song:       
			
			It'll be outside, on the lakeside, so you could in theory, come watch the football, outside, and listen to her in the background. It's going to be quite a night! I'll be up on the roof!        I really should be but the devil on my left shoulder told me to go watch football instead.
		 
			
			Rodney Branigan at the Cava.....     
			
			anyone interested in Baroness at Bad Bonn (Düdingen), 13 July? I got some super dooper expensive earplugs to try out.        
			
			Patti was legendary. The lake was magnificent, and Germany lost. Was that the perfect night?        crap i just saw this! i love patti smith- seen her a ton of times and poetry stuff too... wish i knew i'd have definitely gone...   
i've even got a gorgeous photo of her holding my then 6month old son at a poetry event in nyc... wah. a bit sad now i need to keep up on these things...   
			
			I want to be half that cool when I'm 62!       I would have loved to have gone , but I got the feeling that you would have got the weird Patti doing performance art versions of stuff, rather than the angry Horses version ... 
If it was the later then I wish I had gone !
		    was incredible.                
			
			T'was the latter. I expected a post-menapausal, I know it all and I'm gonna pass on the word Patti, but she rocked! Right up til her final song, which was rock and roll nigga. Having said that, she didn't actually do horses.     
			
			The Coral are playing Abart on November 2nd   
Should be a really good gig and tickets are only 35CHF       
			
			Mike Patton fans- Mondo Cane will be in Lucerne the 29th at the  .       
			
			The Abart team ( ) have announced a lot of sound gigs in autumn. I think those ones haven't been mentioned so far:

11.10 mystery jets @ abart, zurich 
19.10 the cinematics @ hafenkneipe, zurich

          30.11.             (usa) &    (uk)   
sif you would go to Helmet. ffs its HELMET!!!!
		     
almost word for word what a friend said to me when he saw that    
Xiu Xiu in St Gallen in November..
		 
			
			ooh, i'd like to see those Drums in action.  (is the day before my birthday too, sounds like a good excuse for a big friday night)   
i'd be interested in seeing kate nash covered in whipped cream and lip-synching too, but only for laughs             A very good excuse indeed! It would be nice to see you there ... I've got my ticket ...      Yep, I agree, only for laughs, but as I do not like the location, I most probably skip that one.
		 
			
			i have just been informed that the Scissor Sisters are playing the on the 15th of November.          HELL YEAH!    
but that's a looong drive for a tuesday night.      
holy crap! after a quick search they are playing in Yverdon on Dec 1st. STOKED!
		    hope they are better than when they were at hallenstadion, worst gig in my history of gigs and i only had to endure half of it
		    I'll buy ya a beer, so take the train    
			
			02.12.2010 gossip @ x-tra, zurich 
info:   (german)
		 
			
			I see Booker T is playing  tomorrow (21st July). Rather peeved to only spot this now, plus to have to miss it due to soccerball.
		    wish i could. you're very lucky to have the abart. when i lived in zurich, i only saw 3 concerts there (in 3 years) due to working so much and just being out of the loop. recently i went and looked at the history of who has been there since i left in 2001 and thought i was gonna be sick.    
king's x at the abart was one of my favoritist shows ever.    
			
			Here's a few gigs that might be of interest in the ""near"" future:   
Pendulum 30/09 Xtra CHF45   
Goldfrapp 05/10 Xtra CHF60   
The Coral 02/11 Abart CH37

Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan 26/11 Kaufleuten CHF48   
Blood Red Shoes 29/11 Abart CHF35     Sorry for any repeats!   
			
			Pendulum, oh boy, might have to get in early on that one..
		 
			
			Kap Bambino at X-Tra in Zürich this Friday!       
(not sure that's the best of venues though)
		 
			
			It's notable how many bands return to Zürich soon after playing here.  Dan mentioned Blood Red Shoes above, Beach House too.  Do they think it's cool here or is it the strong CHF?   
Here's another returner . . . Au Revoir Simone at Abart on August 23rd, they were good at Stall 6 last September.   
Other acts that may or not be returning:   
Mystery Jets at Abart on 11th October

			Don't know if it is already mentioned, but Iron & Wine is playing on the 16th of September at El Lokal, Zürich.          SO SAD I WILL MISS THAT!      Tonight the YOUNG GODS are playing for FREE!!!!

Eintritt Frei!
		    Paging Gastro Gnome...that thoroughly nice chap is playing for free    
Sadly I'll be somewhere else...   
Oh, and I assume you mean September instead of October       Funnily enough I've met Gilles a couple of times through a friend.  She was visiting London from Estonia and was a big fan of worldwide.  She went to his club and got chatting to him.  He invited her to his house the next day and sent her off with a load of vinyl . . . she went back to Tallinn and became a DJ.  Nice chap.   
Have I already told you that story before?
		     
nice lil' story which doesn't amaze me all that much. Peterson seems like such a nice bloke at least on the radio show    
I might make the drive out ... Zükunft is such a great little club with an awesome vibe and the woodblock prints for announcing the nights
		    I'm not sure you got to the vinyl bit as those pesky Foals were a playing there thingys awfully loud    
*worldwide worldwide worldwide*
		    Ah yes . . . it's all coming back to me . . .
		 
			
			Is anybody heading to Rote Fabrik on Saturday to see The Maccabees?   
It's free from what i can understand of this-        
I might be if I can get out of prior arrangements
		 
			
			Pink Floyd fans should be headed to Dietikon, ZH Saturday evening 9-18-10:          Brilliant!  Yeah . . . I'd like to go and see them.

See    
			
			The Morning Benders tonight at Salzhaus Winterthur   
support is the fantastic Sheila She Loves You from Basel
		 
			
			I can't believe I just read about Maccabees now it now. 
They are pretty cool!
		    It was an excellent gig, more so for being free.  We should lobby them to return.
		 
			
			The brilliant band The Wedding Present are playing on the 31 october in the Mariaberg in Rorschach:     
...why Rorschach       And they're playing Bizarro!?!?!?!?!   
Hmmm . . . might have to look at a hotel there . . .
		    Yes might be an option.    
Not doable on public transport as the last train departing towards Zurich leaves at 22.40.   
Why don't they play at the Volkshaus in Zurich like normal bands do?  
Don't get their marketing strategy?!   But then if they ever had a marketing strategy they'd be a world famous band by now.
		    Their biggest marketing push, as far as I remember, was quite perverse and involved releasing a seven inch single for every month of 1992.  I had 'em all, but have somehow lost track of them.       too much apple pie, Tubbs           
I just checked them out - thanks for the tip - I love them!!  Shame they don't have more dates up on their calendar but I will keep an eye out.  Hope there are more bands like them around - gives me hope    
			
			Nothing beats   for finding out what's on. 
You filter by date, price, distance willing to travel, can link to other social sites etc..
		    How do I see everything in Zürich.   
It just came back with this limited selection:        Hmmm . . . I tried registering.   
Does it only show you bands you track?      I've just spent ten minutes getting nothing but frustrated with that site.  I simply want to see what's on in Zürich.  Instead it seems I have to track a load of bands.  Can't I just track Zürich?
		    Don't know if you meant Sheila she loves you or the morning benders but if it was the first they are playing in La Catrina in Zürich tmw evening for   good idea to get there a bit early though as it fills up quickly.
		    They usually play at least 3 times a year in Switz anyhow..
		    Who told you that? The Wedding Present have hardly ever played 3 times a year in Switzerland (if ever).
		    Yes - Shelia she loves you - I won't be in Switzerland until the 11th October but will checking out all the bands and venues.  Do the gigs usually finish in time to catch the last train back from Zurich to Basel?  Here in scotland there are some venues that run 7 to 10 pm and last train is about 11pm but most venues run to midnight or later.
		    Well if you're moving to Basel I'm sure you'll have plenty of chances to see them. Most venues try to finish in time for the last train but it doesn't always work out.
		    Perhaps slightly exaggerated but they do come through quite often. I know for sure they've played Sommercasino in Basel several times.
		     
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finntroll @ Konzertfabrik Z7 - Dec 12!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't know that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank the holy lord that I was browsing this thread!!!!! One of my current favorite Bands of all time... Slightly strange coincidence too.   
So um, anybody else going?    
			
			Black Rebel Motorcycle Club @ Zurich Volkshaus November 14th   
Can find it listed everywhere but can't find tickets yet...
		   , Luzern on the 15th of October, unfortunately I'll miss it as I'm DJ at Bar 59 the same night.
		 
			
			for those in Lausanne. BRMC are also playing at a festival on the 13.11.2010       
can't find Zurich tickets yet either, but i'll be there.         
			
			Zurich tickets from ticketcorner.ch                   
there you go.
		 
			
			Nick Cave and the Grindermen will be playing at the Folkshaus next Tuesday in Zürich. Anyone else going?
		 
			
			Just click on ""view concert cloud"" and it should show everything that meets your filtered criteria (assuming you've told it where you are)   
just tried it and '10 miles from city' 'now til oct 31' 'no price limit' gave me:

Shellac is playing in Bern on the same day , a bit torn between the two.If he would be singing bad seeds songs it would be easier.
		 
			
			Tell me about it! I'm immersing myself in Grinderman, to get used to it so I won't be too confused on the day. Having said that, they may do a couple of their badseed songs.       
			
			Dollhouse (SWE) play mascotte today (tuesday)- starts around 20h and some norwegian band will open for them.

Martigny   
Deftones 
Frison 
Fribourg   
Bandsintown.com is pretty cool but has some limitations. I'd like to be able to opt out specific locations (like Zurich and anything in France) and it would be cool if you could feed it a list of bands from your music collection. Aside from that a nice utility. A friend told me about something similar that works with your itunes collections, feeds your band names into a database and returns upcoming concerts for bands in your collection plus similar bands.
		    How was the show?      Thank you!   
27th October @            
			
			Not sure if its been mentioned but a band from my home town in Australia are playing on Nov 5. Really Psychedelic but pretty decent the only time ive seen them    
Tame Impala 
Nov 5 @ Mascotte, Zurich
		 
			
			Club night rather than gig: Nu:Tone (Hospital Records)* & Stamina MC are playing at Kaserne, Basel on Sat 23rd Oct:    
Will be heading over from Zurich, anyone else going?   
* UK Drum and Bass producer and DJ
		 
			
			A bit disapointing to be honest. Maybe it was just too early in the tour. Some of it worked, some of it was a disaster. Nick was looking alot like Bunny Munroe.        Hmm. I saw him in Liverpool once; someone shouted ""C'mon Phil Collins"" and he never recovered. To think he let Kylie slip from his arms...
		 
			
			I don't want to talk about         I've met stamina at a house party once. Hes a cool dude. I could make it out for this one. I love hospital artists
		 
			
			Anyone going to see Santana tonight? My old man (who is a good laugh) is going by himself and he probaly wouldn't mind meeting up with some fellow old skool fans.       Anyone going to the Deftones show in Fribourg?  Has anyone been to that venu; is it large, small etc?  Thanks!
		    depending on which hall they use it can hold anywhere from 300 to about 3000 people. Considering it's the Deftones I'd imagine it would be the larger one. Frison is one of the best concert venues in Switz imo. One drawback to it though is that if you're in Basel or ZH it's often difficult to get back home with the train if you wanna stay till the end of the concert.
		    i'm going!    
i saw mastodon there last spring and i enjoyed it but have to say the acoustics there are pretty bad. there are certain spots where the reverberations from the big walls will turn the music into a horrible constant roar. a few feet to the left or right and it's ok again. also, there are no elevated viewing areas (all just a big floor) so if you are on the short side it might not be ideal. otherwise, i like the old warehouse style of venue.
		    Hmm, well i'd be comming from Basel so i guess i should start to look for someone with a car (if anyone is going anway?) or try and find a place to stay.  I wish there were better concert venues in Basel!  Thanks for the info!
		     
a friend of mine might be going with a car. Ask me when the time comes.
		    Cool, I'll prob catch the train over in the eve, let me know if you want to meet up.
		 
			
			Saw sharon jones and the dap kings last night @ kaufleuten and they were amazing. Invited two of my mates and they also raved about the show.   
First time ive been to kaufleuten too. Really cool venue. Might be a little posh for me though    
			
			Anyone going to see   on Friday?  Let me know, I'm going with another lady friend by train from Zurich hb.
		 
			
			The excellent Bonobo is playing a few dates in Switzerland 
Les Docks, Lausanne on 8/12 
Moods, Zurich on 17/12 
Sudpol, Luzern on 18/12   
I'll be going to the Luzern one for sure.
		 
			
			For all the Saffa's out there. The Parlotones are playing at Abart on Sunday 24 October 2010. CHF35 per person, tickets available at ticketcorner.ch.   
Sien julle daar!
		   
Monday November 1st The Charlatans @ ABART 
Thursday November 4th Seu Jorge & Almaz @ ROTE FABRIK 
Monday November 22nd Wax Tailor @ ABART         
Or only CHF33 from Starticket
		    Ooh! Ooh!  I would totally join for Seu Jorge! But I'll be out of town.  
Ah well, next time. 
Let me know how the show is; never seen him live and most of the albums I love of his are *quite* a few years old.
		    Check out his  stuff!  
If you haven't already seen the LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU you must.
		    Balls. Im back home for Xmas. Bonobo is dooooooope
		 
			
			is there anyone interested in two free tickets to KARMA TO BURN playing in Martigny on Nov 3rd? i can't go now due to other plans. i hate to see good tickets go to waste...PM me if interested.
		     
Decent band and nice guys. I would take those tickets off you if only 1) I knew where Martigny was, and 2) David Max and the Sons of Void weren't playing in Basel and Spectrum weren't playing in Basel on the same night.
		 
			
			i was all set to drive an hour to martigny to see them, bought 2 tickets for me and a friend, then later discovered that i had mistaken the date and have another concert (public enemy) on the same night. then to top it off, they booked another show in yverdon on the next night, which is even closer than martigny. i'm planning to go to that one.        
Thank you so much for your post!   
I am definitely going to Seu Jorge's concert! 
Is anyone from Basel joining too?!
		 
			
			Moorcheeba with Skye (26th) in Zurich  
Sounds great, anyone going?
		 
			
			The Black Keys will be performing @ Rote Fabrik next March. 
Should be good!
		 
			
			Do we list club nights here or elsewhere?   
Anyway . . . looks like there's a good thing happening this weekend at Uto Kulm.  That's three legendary DJs!          Cheers for that, to confirm 24th March CHF35....Linky    
Sweet    
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned   as a gig guide/general stuff to do resource...just happened to see a copy of it on the tram this morning and it's a pretty comprehensive       Indeed.  I'm not sure if it's entirely comprehensive though.   
The @zueritipp Twitter feed is laughable.
		 
			
			ooooooH!!!!

			Went there for the first time last night to see Caribou and Shy Child - what a fantastic dive it is ! I miss the toilet venues in London (Dublin Castle, Windmill, Notting Hill Arts Club and so on) and this place would not look out of place if it was in a side street off Oxford Street.   
Recommended if you like down and dirty venues and interesting up and coming bands.   
Shy Child totally kicked bottom. I enjoyed Caribou but after half an hour felt I had enjoyed them sufficiently.   
Coming up - Beach House, The Swans, A Place To Bury Strangers and in January The Fall   
Pay on the door, no advance booking, no credit cards. Like stepping back to the seventies but in a GOOD way.           
Ive been hearing her songs in the local Migros a lot actually. Maybe they have her album or that she's gaining a little notoriety in Switzerland?
		 
			
			of course, in response to this....  i have to offer up the original.  I was never a massive Chisel fan, before my time, but I know every word to this one.                     Only the two in Zurich...but at the Xavier Rudd on 21st and Panteon Rococo on 24th (also in abart)

			Hey Pol, what is Komplex?             Hey Nic. Komplex is a new location (Hohlstrasse 457, Zurich - next to Letzipark). From what I've heard it is bigger than Abart and a good alternative ....
		    Strangely at the same address as Dollhouse  . Could make for some interesting shows.
		    So I look on their website and pop up a post. And then the next day I get a newsletter saying that it's not Zurich but Luzern.

		    The Dropkick Murphy's are from my city (Boston) and i love them!!!  So disapointed i won't be in Switzerland for the show!    Whoever goes, have a great time, its almost impossible not to!
		 
			
			If any of youse are keen on your blues, C.W. Stoneking is playing @ El Lokal, Zurich on the 27th Feb.    
His version of seven nation army on TripleJ a few years ago was a think of beauty. Id post it but its block out of Australia    
			
			Ah, I can't believe I missed Lambchop. And Mark Lanegan, that hurts. And Einsturz. And New Model Army, they are still playing? Wowsies...I should really watch this thread.
		 
			
			Also I saw K&D are playing at Volkshaus on Jan 29th. Im super double mega pumped to see this if anyone's keen for a catch up
		    just got informed that johen arbeit will not be be playing after all      UPDATE VOM 07.01.2011: Leider musste Jochen  Arbeit die Tour aus familiären Gründen absagen. Brian Mitchell wird aber  im Café Kairo eine Solo-Show spielen.      Love love love C.W. Stoneking!   He will also be playing at ISC in Bern on 17th of Feb - this has just made my day.

Hang Me Out to Dry     
			
			<3 the Cold War Kids! Thanks for the heads up on this show!      I've been living in Boston for two years now, and will be moving to Basel in a couple of months. The Dropkick Murphys put on a great show!
		 
			
			Thanks for the heads up...I saw them in Manchester many moons ago, and unfortunately they really did come off as a two/three song band. Still might be worth a watch in a small venue like the Abart.          When will you be in Basel?  If you want to meet up and have a chat or see a show drop me a line    Always nice to meet someone comming from Boston.
		    Sounds like a good show.  I will probably join.  Anyone else going?  Is this venu easy to get to from the main station?
		    Hi JustRose,       (from the Bahnhofquai/HB tramstop)  direction Albisgütli and get off at the Sihlcity Nord stop or you can catch the S4 Train (from track 1 at the Zürich HB) and get off at the Gieshubel stop. Both stops are walking distance.       Looks like the Black Keys have cancelled    
On the plus side Mogwai will play Rote Fabrik on Friday 11th March, tickets CHF35.    
			
			Some others I have seen on Zueritipp:

			Thin Lizzy are playing at Z7 in Pratteln on Thursday 3rd Feb.
		 
			
			I'm definitely going to catch the Foo Fighters at Greenfield this year. The teaser for new sound songs great (well at least the first 30 seconds). Sounds more like their older stuff.     
			
			my favourite song of the foo fighters is "" my hero"", followed by ""the pretender"" and ""wheels"". 
Looking forward to the festival........
		 
			
			I can't make it to Greenfield this year as ill be away so am planning to go to Southside festival (in southern germany) instead.  Anyone been to southside in past years?  It looks like a really great lineup this year: 
Foo Fighters * Blink-182 * Arcade Fire * The Chemical Brothers *Portishead * Arctic Monkeys * Clueso * The Hives * The Subways * Gogol Bordello * Flogging Molly * Elbow * The Wombats * Sublime With Rome * Two Door Cinema Club * Boysetsfire * Selig * Band Of Horses * The Sounds * Klaxons * Eels * Sick Of It All * Parkway Drive * William Fitzsimmons * I Am Kloot * Friendly Fires * Darwin Deez * Converge * Comeback Kid * Portugal.

		    I saw them tonight in Bexhill and they were excellent.  It was the last night of their UK tour before coming over to mainland Europe.  If there are any returned tickets I would definitely recommend it.
		 
			
			The line up for the m4music festival (24.-26.03.2011) is finally out:

		    I saw 'Does it Offend you , Yeah?' in London a couple of years ago.  Quite underwhelming though.    
I'm not a huge Streets fan, but this is a must see as it will be the final tour ever.
		    I'll be there! Anyone else?

			Ever since we moved to basel in October we have been on the hunt for local unsigned indie bands in cool small venues.  So far we have been to 2 gigs - both great but we are used to 2 or 3 a week!!!  Seems the venues are here but not always our genre of music (too heavy or hip-hop etc..)  so after waiting patiently - we have 2 gigs next weekend!! And all Swiss bands!!   
Friday the 25th at Kuppel for the Choo Choo's of Bern and the Kapoolas from Basel   
Saturday the 26th for Basel's own: Shelia She Loves You and the Oh' No's (two of the bands we've already seen) at the Union Kultur Club.   
Along with seeing the Charivari on Monday night (to see the Top Secret Drummers) its gonna be a good week!!!!
		 
			
			^ Sheila She Loves You are fab - their last gig at la Catrina in ZH last year was my fave gig of the whole year. I hope they make it back to ZH sometime soon!
		 
			
			Queens of the Stone Age   
At Komplex 457   
on 11th May
		     YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!                Gimme....where?
		 
			
			In basel try out 
Nordstern 
Hirshnek 
NT areal
		    Cheers for the heads up. Just bagged me some tickets      The one venue we really liked was Sommer Casino - they do a lot of rock, metal as well as hip/hop.  Only a couple indie nights over the last few months.  Also look at the Kaserne - this is right near us and looks fab from the outside but nothing on their calendar really appeals to us.
		    I have to yet find heavy and actually interesting here, but it is not like I venture out much for this, we live in a tiny place...so gota give it real chance. The stuff I have heard was either to eager to be heavy, leaving everything else behind, or noise for the sake of noise, but I am sure there is something worth listening.
		 
			
			queens of the stone age will also be at this year's kilby at bad bonn!!!! can't wait to find out the rest of the lineup!           Just some info on tix: tickets go on sale this  , limited to 4 per person, from either        
or        
Tix are expected to sell out fast, so get in quick!
		 
			
			After lots of wondering why there had been no news, I was sad to hear today that there will be no Zurich Open Air Festival this year   - last year's line-up was so awesome.   
BUT   
it is confirmed for 2012. Yay!       
			
			Bad Kilbi Bonn's a great festival, great atmosphere and generally good bands there. I saw the legendary Sunn o))) there a couple of years ago.
		     :d
		    And they are now sold out.
		 
			
			The Sadies @ El Lokal May 29 ... Also playing the Stolze Open Air Festival Zurich on May 28th     
cheers, 
Sue
		    ahem      
Anyway. She was fantastic.   
It was my first time at Komplex. And it's tiny. I was expecting somewhere a bit bigger than abart but I think it's actually smaller. Although it does have a higher ceiling which helps with the sound.
		    Smaller than Abart?!  Mmkay, explains why QOTSA sold out so quickly.
		    I'm sad that I missed her      
The Komplex venue can be rearranged for bigger shows. The walls are all moveable - actually it's a huge space. That's why it can accommodate bigger acts like QOTSA, My Chemical Romance, Interpol etc etc as well as the smaller ones (Phoenix Foundation, Caitlin Rose) I think the capacity is up to 5000.
		 
			
			Looks like British Sea Power have cancelled their March European tour,  including the Abart gig on the 09.03.11.    
Not sure why....but Noble cracked a rib at the last gig. Bummer!   
Gigs will hopefuly be re-scheduled for later in 2011.
		    Yep, it is planned to be re-scheduled ... or at least that is the plan so far. Fingers crossed!       I used to love Belle and Sebastian until I saw them at Open Air last year, they were pretty lame.    
			
			Haha, got sucked in and forgot what I came on here originally to post    
Anyone else going to Roger Waters this summer? I am already looking forward to it!! I just can't wait haha    
			
			I am going! can't wait       I bought The Boy With The Arab Strap when it first came out on vinyl but never really got into it. Then late last year I bought the latest and love it. Since then I have bought all of the CD's so I hope I'm not disappointed but I think they will be better indoors than out. And it should have a totally different vibe to a festival.

José is a world renowned guitarist, born in Brazil but living in Nyon. He used to teach at the Geneva conservatoire, and has appeared many times at The Paleo and Montreux Jazz festivals. A brilliant artist.
		    When you think they started as a college project, they've come far from the days of playing King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow.   
I've seen them a few times and they always deliver, but can get a little twee. At one show at the Rote Fabrik they covered Dire Straits' Romeo and Juliet. Hmm. Since Isobel Campbell left, so did the darker elements. Still worth seeing though

			Noise fans,  is playing tomorrow (sun March 6th, 9pm), in Geneva, at  .    
I was curious myself, saw this performer from New Zeland 3 days ago in Prague and he blew my mind. Plus, he is a really cool dude, high school prof on his sabatical touring the world with his musical mission. He is quite big in his field, so far on this tour he has played in UK, Scandinavia, CZ, FR, after CH he is going to Japan. Just a note for the gentle souls amongst us, bring ear plugs (just in case the sound guy sucks  ).    
It's short and sweet, very intense and a ton of dizzy fun. We are going.
		     
Wow...just checked out the Gurtenfestival...many bands I like!

But, were very lucky to have Campbell Kneale of  on our couch past few days, weeheee...a lot of interesting talk.    
Check out Cave12 in Geneva, it's a fantastic project, loads of gigs are in  , an experimental culture place, I think it used to be a squat, unsurprisingly. I love the venue, nice people, guests and staff. Cave12 are great, too. Very approachable, I want to gig with them, when we finally put sh...t together.

2 Day music festival in Basel - April 1st and 2nd. Figures we are in scotland that weekend for a 2 day music festival in Edinburgh but anyone else looking for live music (indie, etc...) in little venues should consider going!!   
I've been to a couple of the venues and they were great (summer casino, kaserne) and have seen The Kapoolas and really liked them.   
Oh and Shelia she loves you!!  Very good local Basel band!
		 
			
			I've got the following gigs lined up: the human league, swans and qotsa at the bad kilbi bonn festival, earth, cyndi lauper, marianne faithful, belle and sebastian but I'm most looking forward to seeing Earth

			for the same customers(frauenfeld) is the festival in wohlen (Touch the air), june 23th to 26th with timabland, akon, ludacris, busta rhymes to name a few     
			
			British band The Brew playing the Galery Music Bar near Z7 in Pratteln tomorrow night        Yes that looks a great line-up. Underworld are amazing live, and been wanting to see 2ManyDJs live for a long time. 
I'll hopefully be able to spend the whole weekend there.     
And for this weekend (Sat 2nd April): Kings Of The Jungle @ Komplex Zürich:        
			
			Another reminder for my mates awesome Rock'nRoll April events at Sedel, Luzern, stoner/pysch/desert/doom rock.   Different concerts on the 3rd, 8th, 21st(22nd is a holiday btw, so you can stay out late) and the 23rd of April, see   for details.       
Sedel is a great venue for these bands, I just wish it was a little closer to town.  Shuttle busses do run every half hour I think and only cost a tip for the driver.
		 
			
			Also, just seen   and   are playing Stall 6 in Zurich on the 2nd of April.  Loving whatever that scene is, electronic hip hop beats, monster bass and synths.  Their albums are well worth a listen if you don't mind a bit of the electronic).   
Edit : FFS, Young Gods play Sedel on the same night, and it's a friends birthday, damn.
		 
			
			The line-up for the Palèo Festival has just been announced - The National, PJ Harvey, Portishead, Beirut, The Strokes, Anna Calvi, The Chemical Brothers and more...               
			
			Filter at Abart on 22 June       there are some fine acts playing there but mainly during the week and I've got to work!    
			
			Best thing about Paleo, for me, has always been the discovery of acts I would've never seen otherwise...  &   come to mind in recent memory
		 
			
			Don't forget! Belle and Sebastian @ X-Tra ZH next Wednesday 13.04.11 Perfect indie pop - herbaceous borders, foxes, cups of tea etc etc            
Filter are phenomenal live, I saw them at a festival when Richard Patrick got nailed in the head with waterbottle. Didn't miss a beat right at the corus of 'Hey Man Nice Shot'.   
Crowd went berzerk! Sick mosh pit. I never knew 'Take a Picture' could be such a heavy song.   
Gonna hit up this show up for sure.
		 
			
			José González & The Göteborg String Theory are playing tomorrow (Friday 8th April) at Salzhaus Winterthur.

			I heard that next thursday Beardyman is playing @ Stall6 for around 20CHF. If you get the chance check out his essential mix from this year (or last..... can't remember...). Basically beat-box's the entire thing while looping over himself beat-boxing.    
Its like the musical form of Inception

Line Up Friday:                                                             
Already have my tickets for friday.             How was it? I wanted to go but didn't want to put up with the pain of getting back to Zürich - I had things to do on Saturday.
		 
			
			Not sure if anyone has mentioned this before but Raul Midon will be playing in Zurich at Moods on 10th May. Tickets available   priced at CHF38.   
This guy is brilliant        
			
			Atari Teenage Riot are playing at Salzhaus, Winterthur, 21.05.11           
Minus a member, right?
		    Yeah there's just 3 of them on tour - Alec Empire, Nic Endo, and MC CX KiDTRONiK, I think. Carl Crack OD'd in 2001.
		 
			
			Sheffield band   are playing @ Stall 6, ZH next Wednesday 18.05.11         (ps. I've got some free tix if anyone wants them, check the 'Free Stuff' section)   
			
			Holy Sh!t!   
Wilco are coming to Basel on 7th November - playing the Kaserne   
Also the Wild Beasts are playing on the river in Basel on 11th August.   
Awesome!!!
		 
			
			Cat's Eyes (Faris Badwan of The Horrors, and Canadian opera singer Rachel Zeffira) are playing at Hafenkneipe, ZH, on Thursday 26.05.11, kind of dark girl group pop with goth undertones. Watch their debut performance at the Vatican (of all places!):       
			
			anyone else going to einstürzende neubauten tomorrow and on thursday in lausanne? i'm SO looking forward to it! if i manage to get there in time that is...   
			
			A while away yet, but awesome Kiwi band   are playing at Abart, ZH, Thurs. 08 September 2011. I saw them at the m4m festival this year and they almost blew the roof off Exil.
		 
			
			Cut Copy + Architecture in Helsinki @ Stall 6, ZH, 28.06.11 - so I will get to see AiH this year after all    
			
			Grandmaster Flash at Stall 6, Zürich, Saturday May 28, 22.00
		    Getting back home was the expected long, drawn-out, sleepy saga, but it was worth it. Cinema-gig with the band sitting on stage in front of the screen, ripping into their instruments, while videos played behind, it was pretty unique. The band hung around before and after and had beers with the masses too, nice blokes.
		 
			
			DJ Shadow at Komplex Zurich on 04.06   
and Arcade Fire at Montreux Jazz Festival on 10th July!!          I try and go every year, will be there all 4 days this time. If you like old school 90s hip hop they usually have a big name one evening or another. The rest is either French Pop / Reggae (so many hippies in NE) / usually decent electro and some kids singer on the Sunday afternoon which is when the families are there.    
  It was really crowded last year, I hope it'll be better organised (more bars, less VIP space) so getting drinks doesn't take half an hour. There's load of benches and what not so sit down on and it's by the lakeside so you can smoke by the rocks if you want. Thing of it as a Fete Des Vendanges you have to pay an entrance to and that has decent music. Well worth it... so long as it doesn't rain too much, but most of the place is covered by tents anyway.
		 
			
			Too bad I am not here!  
The  in Winterthur (15 min by train from Zürich!) is on in June, they have concerts from June 10-12th.               
ENJOY         playing Zürich 30th June
		 
			
			Anyone wanna join me in the Rote Fabrik to see Slim Cessna's Auto Club. Some band members from 16 Horsepower, in the theme of American folkrock, kinda.       
			
			Simian Mobile Disco playing Nordstern in Basel on Friday night and Cut Copy playing Hinterhof on 29th. Really looking forward to both.
		 
			
			CEREMONY is playing on the 28th of july in Dynamo in Zürich:

Together with:   
TOXIC HOLOCAUST 
TRAP THEM 
WOLVES LIKE US
		 
			
			Destroyer is playing Rote Fabrik on the 24th of June. His last album out-80s the 80s, and if the live show is anywhere near as batshit-bizarre as this video, it should be interesting.       
			
			Lenny Kravitz  at the Hallenstadion Nov.26 th  
Flogging Molly at the Komplex 457 Nov.17 th 
The Kooks at Komplex 457 Oct.26 th
		 
			
			the Cat Empire are playing at Komplex on the 12th November (tix on sale on the 29th June)
		    Yes - did I miss it?     
Can't believe I've only just found this thread    
			
			Just got back from seeing Filter at Abart. It was AWESOME! It's quite surreal seeing bands that I grew up listening to.  Back in the Republic of South Africa, it's a dream come true to see bands like this.  I'm very grateful to be able to have these experiences and see these band that I admire and really love.
		 
			
			Sebadoh at Abart in Zürich on August the 15th. Grungey!       
			
			Just happened to notice Fleet Foxes are playing at Komplex 457 on 21.11...some way off yet I know! As much as I like their albums I'm not sure about seeing them live - anyone seen them before?
		 
			
			^ I haven't seen Fleet Foxes before, but I'll be there.   
also, awesome aussies cloud control are playing at hafenkneipe 19.09.11. great band, lovely people.
		    Not quite my thing but very good live, I've heard.
		 
			
			Switzerland has its fair share of good gigs!!!      always has a good line up.   
And the Red Hot Chili Peppers are playing in Zurich before they even come to the UK!!!! Dec 13th at Hallenstadion!
		 
			
			The Dub Pistols are playing in Fribourg tomorrow night, 2nd July, as part of Fribourg Jazz Parade. Don't really know much about them, but sound right up my street.          Generally regarded as having given a very weak performance at Glasto last weekend.
		 
			
			Manic Street Preachers are playing at the Winterthurer Musikfestwochen on Sunday 28.08.11:          @ Plaza, ZH, 01.11.11. Tickets  .
		 
			
			11.10.2011 - Beady Eye @ Volkshaus, Zurich 
Tickets are going on sale tomorrow ( )
		 
			
			Not Zürich but definately worth the trip - The Antlers play St. Gallen 3rd December.
		 
			
			Some bands work much better in a venue then at a festival. Actually most bands do.       
			
			Hi we're just moving down from Lux in Sept and in the past few weeks have seen Foals, PJ Harvey - Prince played here etc etc. There is a good music scene here and it's advertised of 2 main websites, is that the case in Zurich or Switz as a rule? 
Thanks
		    Arse - back in the UK then. The last album was a corker .... back to the old form
		    Sunday August 14 - Zofingen - Heitere Open Air Festival
		    It's ok. There's a lot of bands that don't come. As Far as I'm aware PJ and Foals have never been.
		    PJ plays Paleo I believe, this weekend. And I'll miss her       Tickets available on ricardo if you want them.    
I'm just going to pretend that I meant Zürich.
		    Nope ... Foals played at Abart last year. Zurich is not that bad after all       I didn't say i was bad, just ok! I'll revise my opinion when Radiohead come and play on their next tour.
		    damn, only one Swiss date??    
Will you be seeing them on the UK leg of their tour DP?
		    I am going to see them in Hastings.  Just a few minutes walk from my house

			Zurich: Wednesday 17th August   
PRINCE!!       
There are no more standing tickets left from ^ that ticket link, but I found mine from a UK website
		 
			
			The concert from prince in cologne arena was absolut rubbish, he played 
one song, left the stage for 50 mins, returned for anonther 65 mins and left 
early after a total of 75 mins played, some people payed about 150 euros for a seat.         That's a shame. He's usually one of the best live acts out there (imo) 
I hope he'll not be doing the same in Zurich
		 
			
			Friendly Fires will definitely be worth a look....   
Sadly I won't be able to make it - but I recommend   (Abart, 8th Sept)

			Great baltimore duo Wye oak are playing at Fri-Son, Fribourg 10.11.11 (sadly no ZH show   )              they're playing geneva too on the 7th. thanks for the heads up.
		     
Saw them a couple of years ago at that very spot.  Was very, very loud, we got very drunk, one mate got into a fight in the mosh pit and was almost thrown out, another ended up sleeping under a mattress in a squat somewhere in Zurich.
		 
			
			I'd like to recommend the songkick.com website, it's brilliant. 
It scans your iTunes library or you can quickly and easily choose the interests that interest you as well as the cities and you have a personalized calendar and receive emails when concerts of interest are announced.
		 
			
			Brilliant !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		     
This is spam but the songkick iOS app is pretty good.
		                i'll be there! in lausanne as well!  )

 Tickets went on sale this morning...I got mine at starticket      
V excited...though I might get over that by January       I've heard the Spice Girls are reforming, maybe that's more to your tastes?
		    Oh and you sadly missed Biebef by a couple of weeks, I'm afraid.

			Not so much a Heads-up, more of an ""Oh Bollocks"", but did anyone catch the Buzzcocks in Aarau last Saturday? Any good? I missed it as I was in the UK.        Saw them last year when the played Zug OpenAir (free festival) it was nice to say I'd seen them but tbh they were nothing special at all.

			For all you Vaud jazzers,   is coming to Chorus, Lausanne, 15 October 201, with his Migration band.  This is a musician/drummer not to be missed if you can make the gig.  Reservations will be necessary, I am sure.   
Antonio has many projects, but those of you in the know will recognize him as Pat Metheny's drummer in his PMG (Pat Metheny Group), the drummer since 2003.       
This is a big musician coming to Lausanne.

			Perhaps this could be interesting for some people: the people from the Kilbi festival in Düdingen/Bad Bonn will launch something like a   in winter - 9th/10th December in Exil (and Moods) Zurich.   
Particularly looking forward to Glenn Branca Ensemble and Thurston Moore. It's a little pricey (85.- for both days), though it's worth it for me.

You can buy tickets for 24 CHF through  ,  , at SBB and Post. Or you can buy it at the venue for 26 CHF from 21h on the night of the gig.   
The concert itself starts at 22h, but there will be a party at around midnight with DJ Edin and DJ Bob Rock playing Balkan/electro music.   
Kultur Shock plays some sort of Balkan music/rock/metal/punk fusion, and they are particularly good live. Well see for yourselves:       
and the same track live at exitfest 2010 in Novi Sad, Serbia:       
Great huh?! }:-)

			Don't forget: British Sea Power are playing at the Abart, ZH this Wednesday 12.10.11. They had to cancel their ZH show twice before, so fingers crossed they'll make it this time!           
			
			pretty much my reaction too, with an few choice expletives thrown in though. I did regain my composure long enough to selflessly post it here, thinking it might help some deserving music fan out that way catch them.          Good concert, though I was pretty drunk. Place seemed to empty by the end of the gig, shame really, but as their last album was their worst so far then I'm not surprised.

			Saharan blues from Tinariwen at Kaufleuten in Zurich on Saturday 15th October. If you've not heard them live and like riddim then it's the concert for you. A major influence on so many records recently.   
I happen to have two tickets for this show for sale at cost price  .

			The Italian electro-rock band   is visiting Basel.   
The gig is starting at 21h on 30th of October in Grenzwert bar (Rheingasse 3, in Kleinbasel).      to their profile with more of their work.   
And a small glimpse on what you might expecting a few weeks:     
So if you feel like changing your Swiss routine, you can start by going out on Sunday evenings as well. }:-)

		    We rarely read reviews after the event on this thread, so I'll keep it brief: It was very good   Support act François & The Atlas Mountains had some interesting beats but strange, Eno-esque dance moves, which were a bit theatrical, but in all very West Coast French dance melancholia. Anna Calvi's voice is a joy to hear. Nuff said.   
Oh Hai GastroGnome! I tried to grab ya but you had more beauties surrounding you than I did, so I didn't want to steal your thunder       I was there too! I'll be writing a review soon (on my blog, though, will post a link), just haven't had a moment. We should do a meet up at the next suitable gig, what do you think?

			A bumper week for music in ZH next week! Obviously getting to all of them may involve some kind of cloning technology   but here are my tips:       
			
			I'd love to say The Kills were great last night, but due to the   sound at X-tra, it's hard to say.    
Not the first time either - I'm not going to waste my hard earned on that venue anymore.
		     Were you upstairs or downstairs?   
I find if you are right in the middle upstairs the sound is not so bad.

			Sisters of mercy (chf 55) and its at xtra in zurich. Date 23rd November 2011   
I've got a spare ticket for the above   
If you're interested please pm me
		 
			
			looking forward for the sisters of mercy tomorrow and on thursday! can't believe i have never seen them before!    
next days' schedule:     
tomorrow: work, drive to zürich, gig, drive back 
thursday: train to lausanne, work, gig, sleep 
friday: drive back, work 
saturday: drive to zürich, vive la fete gig 
sunday: drive back, probably spend day on sofa 
monday: work, drive to zürich, fakir's gig, drive back ?   
why do all the bands chose to play at the same time and almost never in bern??
		    I was bang in the middle, about a foot behind the sound desk. Logically I would have thought the best place for sound in the venue...       yes,that is normally the best spot  . Try upstairs next time if you can.
		    price negotiable, if anyone is interested
		    mhm, the last time when there was paul kalkbrenner, sound was fine?!  
same with belle & sebastian and morcheeba.
		 
			
			sisters of mercy gig at the xtra was pretty good but the sound quality was terrible, more due to xtra than the sisters. not the first time a gig has been ruined for me at the xtra due to useless sound quality
		 
			
			Right, don0t know what the problem there is. The second half of the gig was much better.          Skindred are an awesome band - saw them at Download a couple of years back.  DK Murphies are a must see too - saw them in boston last year.
		 
			
			anyone going to any of these?   
the horrors - tomorrow night 
smashing pumpkins - next fri 2nd dec 
dEUS - next sat 3rd dec 
thurston moore - sat after 10th dec   
im new to town (zurich) but will be headinbg to these gigs, so feel free to say hi!   
(especially if you know where i can buy vimto...)
		 
			
			I'll be at the Horrors tonight, gimme a shout if you want to meet up. I know of a few Asian stores in Oerlikon which sell Vimeo that I can give you directions for ^^
		 
			
			sounds good       i'll most probably be at the dEUS one! and also at dEUS in neuchatel on the 6th     
thurston moore, i thought i was going but it's on the same date as FAQ's gig in Aarau   
and i think i'm probably going there, as the partying will surely be better!    
i had some friends seeing smashing pumpkins in london a few weeks ago and they were very disappointed (and they are pretty big fans). so i'm not going (to be fair, i wouldn't go anyway as i'm not crazy about them)   
we seem to like similar music, so feel free to come and say hi tomorrow at Fakir's show in kaffi für dich (details a few posts above).
		 
			
			Hi Crimson, I'll see I will see about monday night, tho i tend to work late at the moment. I'll def be at dEUS tho, my fav band! That should be ace. it woul dbe good to go to the show on the 6th as well but, work!   
Shame to hear your friends didnt like the pumpkins recently, i had friends at copenhagen, manchester and london gigs and they were nothing but loving the shows. they are the band that usually suprise me most at shows with how amazing they are, but i shall see!
		 
			
			i hope you will enjoy the sp show! let us know!    
dEUS are perfect. every time i see them i can't get over how great they are. and they are not even my favourite band! (but amongst the top ones anyway)

The Musical Box is a highly professional canadian Genesis tribute band. They bring the early Genesis years - when Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett were still in the band - back to life. They recreate their vintage shows as original as possible. The sounds, the sights, the costumes, the lights, the everything. They are very approved by the original band. Phil Collins even played a show or two with them. This time they will play the ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"" show in its entirety. It's rumoured that original Genesis guitarist   will join them for the encores!

hoo.   
CHF300.- gone. just. like. that.                  I've got tickets for wilco, earth, bruce springsteen and mastodon. I am thinking of seeing the tindersticks (brilliant in geneva in 2010, good in zurich in 2011) and lambchop. I saw lambchop a few years ago in the rote fabrik and they were dreadful, the band was sloppy, the crowd got bored and people started to go home. they must have had a fight because there was lots of banter between them which didn't involve the audience. this was promoting the damaged album.
		    I was at that gig: it was US Independence Day. Talking backstage with them during the interval Kurt and MacManus were talking about being TourBlind: it was getting tired and no longer personal. They wanted to be with their families, especially on that night. After a peace pipe, they came back on and played some haunting stuff, which many didn't enjoy, as you note. The banter was down to, er, the pipe, me thinks.   
Crap jokes were still crap, though. Can't wait to see them again.

You can post concert events on the mysteriously invisible*   or under   ( if you're a promoter or financially involved).   
Putting a concert / event on the calendar gives it greater exposure and allows for some 'buzz' (is this what the kids call it these days?).

			MAZZY STAR is playing in the Rote Fabrik in Zürich on the 18th of July         MOD EDIT: Nickelback thread merged   
I have never met an actual fan of this band.   
I'm sure they have some, but are probably too embarrassed to admit it. I don't blame them.
		   They've sold over 50 million albums, allegedly
		 
			
			I've been wanting to see Mazzy Star for years but alas I'm on holiday that day!
		 
			
			the song about the panties down by the ankles is cringeworthy
		    The same fans that think Bon Jovi are a great ""heavy metal band"" or ""Survivor"" and ""Europe"" kick ass.*           (*Um, they don't ....)   
			
			here's a great video with all the wikipedia 'updates' on Nickelback over the years.     
Some are very informative and amusing            
I guess I'll be dancing alone then           Canada has enough awesome music.    
Nickelback is just the Canadian reaction to Creed.
		 
			
			Dropkick Murphys will play Jun 12 th in Prattteln , Z 7
		    Ah wow, they'll have to play this song wouldn't you think. It's my wife and my song... Ahhhhhh Jüüüüüüüüüü

This coming Saturday   
Demented Are Go & The Hillbilly Moon Explosion at Kammgarn in Schaffhausen               
			
			the official ""leaked"" schedule for Montreux Jazz...       
( I'm not overwhelmed personally )
		 
			
			Looking forward to RPWL at the Galery Music Bar in Pratteln this evening:       
Although the Z-7 crew are promoting and selling tickets, the venue is the Galery just down the road, not the Z-7 black hall.   
RPWL started life as a Pink Floyd covers band, but they've had their own progressive style for more than a decade now, their latest CD ""Beyond Man and Time"" is very good melodic rock.
		    I'd go just to see Janelle Monae. She's amazing
		    I like the line-up but can't understand why it's called Montreux ""Jazz"". Been to Cully last weekend, much jazzier there and a fantastic atmosphere.
		 
			
			Would love to see Tony Bennett but tickets are very expensive
		    I guess it's kind of hard to change the name midride.... and much of nowadays music is influenced by jazz (the good stuff at least)
		 
			
			Eagles of Death Metal are playing in Solothurn on the 21st of June.           
Nothing remarkably new or mindblowingly good, but never fail to entertain live. I'd go just to see Jesse Hughes do his little dance.
		 
			
			I have a spare ticket for ""The Slackers"" (SKA), Thursday April 26th, Zürich, Dynamo. Please PM me if you want it, it'll only cost a beer.       
			
			Paleo   released and some interesting choices

Sat On The Maaat, 
Nobody understood whhhhhy 
He Wore A Haaaat 
I Miss Yoooooou 
Why Did You Leeeeeeeeave Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...""       
Saw him a few years ago at the wonderful bastion of downtown bohemia El Lokal, but almost fell asleep. He has a massive following but somehow he's lost his bite.    
Chicks dig him though, so see you there.
		    Definitely a victim of his own prolificacy.   
He is my beard mentor though, I'll be heading along for some ad hoc trimming tips.
		    MOLOTOV will also play in Winterthur, Salzhaus, 
September 7th. Great, so I can go to the microbrewery festival the 2nd.

It can be hard to get overview once the thread reaches such a size, so do make use of the calendar if you're going. Thanks.

			Graveyard,  from Sweden will be here to blow a few cobwebs away  in the Mascotte -  11 December 2012

			Django Django play Zurich's Rote Fabrik, 27th November.

Tickets are on sale at   for a WHOPPING 78,60 plus the print at home fee makes it an 80 CHF ticket... I don't get why they charge us to print out the ticket at home.. that should be free right?   
			
			Quite a treat: starting on Friday, 16th November at the Reitschule in Bern is the   festival, celebrating 15 years of Constellation Records. Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Do Make Say Think, and A Silver Mt. Zion, amongst others.       Godspeed also in Zürich's Rote Fabrik for 35chf    
Can't wait! Although I've never seen them live so I have no idea what to expect...

			The Tindersticks ( ) and the Maccabees ( ) are playing in Fri-Son in November. Don't realy know a great deal about either band, but will have a butchers at YouTube and might pop along to one or the other.   
Edit: Sorry, had wrong dates.
		          The Tindersticks are a brilliant band, check out their second album with this cover (   and Curtains:   
The music is melancholic, moody, orchestral   
They can be brilliant live especially when they have their string and horn sections in tow.   
I fully recommmend them and good luck!
		    Thanks for the heads-up on this @Crumbs.  Can't wait!    
			
			What is it with the XTRA venue in Zürich?The sound quality is truly dreadful. I have seen several live bands there and I have always noticed the poor sound quality. Only the supremely organized or very loud acts seem to be able to overcome the poor sound quality of this venue.
		 
			
			Thanks PaddyG, I've been wanting to see the Maccabees for years :-). Seen Tindersticks, not really my bag.       
			
			I'll be going to:

			I've got tickets for Fleetwood Mac on 13-10-2013 at the (wretched) Hallenstadion in Zurich and I'm really excited about seeing Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie and the two lucky guys
		    There have been rumours about (no pun intended  ) that Christine McVie may also appear on the tour
		    I'm glad to hear it but I thought she'd retired completely, she really has to sing her songs, Stevie Nicks has too country a voice to sing Christine's songs imho. I'm also really looking forward to seeing Buckingham, a seriously underrated guitarist, play

They are appearing at Z7 in Pratteln on May 9th.     
This as a trailer to their debut album 'Dimensionaut'.  It should appeal to all prog. rock fans.          Thanks for the heads up. Saw them last night at the Stadthalle in Sursee. It was just like it would be to see the real Pink Floyd playing in a high school basketball gym. Fantastic!

I'm finally going to get to see one of my favourite bands!    
			
			Nouvelle Vague play Kaserne in Basel on 2nd October. I have my tickets :-)           
btw what did you think of the gig? I wasn't impressed, I saw her last year in Geneva and she way way better
		    strange, i was also last year in geneva and did not enjoy it very much. i thought she was in a bad mood, whereas in zürich she was in a good mood   
i really liked the one in zürich and the one in montreux a couple of weeks later. still have the songs in my head. gotta love her.
		    i'm going as well! and to another place they're playing, could it be geneva? (yes too lazy to check)    
i've seen them live a few times already and i'm always impressed by the energy they bring on stage. much better than the cds in my opinion. you will love it!
		    Oh! I thought I might be the only one from here that would be interested. Maybe with the exception of Prof T.   
I saw Red Sky Coven a few years ago, but haven't managed NMA yet. Really looking forward to it.
		    exciting, isn't it?   see you there!    
			
			Fat Freddy's Drop, in Zurich 21st October

		    god they were incredibily shit live 3 years ago at the kaufleuten. they sound like a local schoolband doing covers, far from their fab CD productions.

			I'm hoping for a fun night out rather musical masterpieces.        
			
			For country fans, Band Perry will be in concert in Zurich at   on the 23rd of November.  Warm-up acts (not listed here) are:  Easton Corbin and a a dynamite guitar player from Canada, Lindsay Ell (her mentor was Randy Bachman of BTO).
		 
			
			I don't get the nouvelle vague love, for me its money for old rope.
		    well, some versions have a bit of fresh new paint to it or sound interesting though i am not a big fan. just got a ticket from a friend, so i just 'been there'. what i like about them is the nice singing voice of the girl that wasnt there at kaufleuten and therefor (sorry, lou) were rather like a fly buzzing around my head...
		 
			
			vive la fete are playing in bern this coming saturday. woop!        
			
			Hi guys, been lucky enough to follow some of the greatest bands around just before they ""made it"" (luck and friends, not me). Went to see this Swiss band absolutely amazing and a brilliant punctuation to my move to Sydney. I think Domi should be big and I mean BIG       This got good around the five minute mark.  Sounds like what would happen if you put Thom Yorke and the XX in the same room.
		    Really cool music but my god what a shocking voice. They really need a new singer...        You have a good point...Not everyone can be this guy:       
			
			Anyone going to see Lucero on September 18?
		    I gotta see her live one of these days, can't believe I have missed her so many times. Did she do Nude on the News?
		    nope, unfortunately! according to my catpower expert boyfriend (and kind of friend of hers) she refuses to play it
		    I can't have too much of her all the time, a bit too dramatic but Nude on the News is one of my all time favs, really. She is so spontaneous and talented. I hung with folks who went to see her a lot in Atlanta.
		    i cannot have too much of her at once as well. but i like her more and more as the years go by
		 
			
			So I went to see Nouvelle Vague on Wednesday night, the sound quality of the band was not so good but the singing was perfectly fine and the entertainment factor was excellent. Over all a great night out and a lot of fun; I would go and see them again.           maybe because her song is called Nude as the News... see! Catpower loves me more than you!    
			
			After skipping out on most of the festival scene this summer, I'm excited to see The Dirty Head and the iconic Sublime (with Rome) on Nov. 12 at Haerterei. Great show for those who enjoy the punk/ska/reggae cali scene.           
			
			Rude Zone Festival at Dynamo, Zurich, November 1st:

			Just a follow-up to previous post -   is the longest running Country Fest in the world.  It's a beautiful day today so why not cap it off at one of the best looking concert locations listening to some great music.    is the headliner tonight.

		    Bad bonn kilbi is the best featival ever! In the middle of nowhere....highly recommended! I cannot go this year (getting married that weekend) but i cannot stress enough what a cool festival it is! 
Ps: if you go make sure to walk to the nearby lake and enjoy the beauty of thr scenery
		     
oh wow The Black Angels too! AND Mac Demarco!
		 
			
			Just seen the line up for Monteux Jazz 2015 and I don't think there is any artist that particularly stands out.  Perhaps they are keeping the best for next year as it will be the 50th one       
			
			thanks for the heads up, some good acts playing like Ibeyi, Foxygen, The Staves, Portishead, Sophie Hunger, Lionel Richie, Kronos Quartet, James Blake, Sly and Robbie, Anna Calvi, Alt J, Santana, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, George Benson,  etc etc   
but some serious crap as well, there is very little quality control going on these days
		 
			
			i'd also recommend dEUS and asaf avidan
		    I missed this, I love the Sleaford Mods!   
Otherwise a weak line up. I saw Thurston Moore with Sonic Youth at BKB a few years ago and they were lame. Highlight were the mighty Sunn O)))   
@crimson, I fully agree BKB is a great festival with a great vibe
		 
			
			Thurston Moore solo, I would go see. It is different, especially if he is in the mood.    
dEus is amazing. And James Blake.    
I want to see all that       Thurston Moore has different moods? How can one tell?
		    The left corner of his lips is about 2mm above the right one?   
I know    
But I do like drony stuff that washes over. There's certain poetry in a wall of noise.    
Which reminds me, completely unrelated, I gotta wish for a uke for my bday that is coming up    
			
			Ed Sheeran - is he back anytime soon?

Nada Surf 22.04.2016 Dynamo 
We plan to be around ..just wondering
		    No idea but its May now, so you're most likely a little late.   
			
			recommended gigs in the VERY NEAR future (May) for Zurich:   
16.05: Dandy Warhols, Plaza (think of White Stripes with more fun)     
27.05: Porches, Klaus (from NYC - great fun)     
28.05: Dead Meadow, Club Zukunft (superb psych/garage band)     
29.05: Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Mascotte (surely no need to introduce them?)        anyway, they are a good band - very indie, if they come round again worth the trip.
		 
			
			Ezra Furman plays in Zurich tonight at Bogen F, 21:00.
		   play in Zurich at the  , 8th February.        
			
			I love them. ""Up with People"".   
Ezra Furman and his ""My Zero"" is MiniMC's ultimately fav song.
		    Doh! its the Missus's Birthday, oh well, I will just say its a surprise       Lambchop play Geneva the night before the Zurich gig; they play Luzern the night after.    
Ezra was ok the other night but the crowd seemed more happy to be there than enjoy being there, but that's the Swiss concert experience. He seemed tired.
		    I find that infuriating, in Zürich its about being seen at a concert but with absolutely no interest in the music! I am always telling people to stfu especially during quieter songs, when it seems the gig becomes a social gathering. The amount of times I have heard performers saying something about that during a performance, I don't think the Zürich audience gets it!    
			
			sooooo true....
		 
			
			Great thread. Any hint of U2 coming back...sadly passed us by last time (from a fans point of view that is).
		    It will be better when people start caring more for content than form. Being seen may also translate as liking the music, privately, you cannot expect a discrete culture all of a sudden show authentic affection in a prestigeous environment. The fact that the musicians and loads of listeners do not consider it prestigeous (the partisan opposite) is irrelevant.    
Les Grottes are great; in GE. Anti prestigeous. Weird enough stuff.
		    Lead from the front: dancing and enjoying yourself is the perfect way to get your square metre of space and will encourage the others. I was, however, told off by a woman once at a Nicolas Jaar gig for dancing. I apologised and told her next time I wanted to have fun I'd stay at home and listen on my headphones. Some just can't abide happiness in others.
		     
Hahahah. I am used to lead from the stage   , the best kind of hedonistic leadership.    
Well - I agree with you. There are places that support actual fun. And I also think that people do not dance for the same reason other stuff doesn't get done here, worried about spontaneity/authenticity being perceived as impolite, rude.    
I dance when I feel like it. Gigs, classrooms, balet halls, tents. I think the stiffness will change. A buddy of mine went to headphones party (4 diff music channels), she had to look for somebody dancing to the same stuff. Fun. And some rooms had no light. Gasp! Puritanism is on its way out of life.

			For those of you that enjoy Viking/Pagan metal. The only reason why I'm going is to see a Swiss band called Eluveite:     
			
			When exactly is Paganfest? This is very relevant to my interests!!
		    It would appear to be some kind of concert performed by a number of bands with incomprehensible names (fake runes apparently being de rigueur) in Pratteln on February 19th.   
There is a Myspace page all about it  .    
			
			And hopefully Viking babes looking to conquer dark-skinned savages.
		     
Hmmm... if the pagans I've known are anything to go by, they'll either patronise you to death about your 'culture' or despise you for not being Aryan.   
Although I should imagine most people attending the festival will be weekend pagans at best...    
			
			Aryan as in Indian?          I suspect their definition is slightly narrower...

			Hi   
I am looking for a shop, or a website, where I could buy tickets for concerts, musicals, theater,.... 
We have the Fnac in France, but I don't know if I can find something similar here in Zurich.   
Thanks
		 
			
			We have a Fnac in Geneva and Lausanne... And according to their website, there's one in Fribourg as well.   
You need to also look at ticket corner ( ), you can buy online.
		 
			
			Hi,   
Try

			I absolutely LOVE world music (Particularly Arabic & African). Does anyone know if there is a world music concert/festival on around Switzerland or close by?    
I cannot seem to find much information.    
Does anyone else share my passion?
		 
			
			Hello Chardie   
I grew up with the original world music providers of the 1970's, Weather Report.  Joe Zawinul (my avatar pic) and Wayne Shorter began what was to be the seminal jazz group moving the river into world music spheres.  Joe took it to another level when Weather Report was disbanded and he formed the Syndicate.  It was the world grooving-est gig to be found anywhere, bar none.   
You will have to keep a heads up on perhaps TicketCorner or some other ticket re-seller for world music gigs in the larger venues.  Also occasionally some of the better real jazz festivals have World Music artisits, like the Cully Jazz Festival, which remains a true jazz festival in name and soul.   
Where do you live? If in the Lausanne area   sometimes has some good world music gigs.  The last world music gig I saw was a little over a year ago with Mokshana.  Great vibe and moving into and out of various deep cultural veins of musical style, sometimes integrating them.  Keep an eye on the website and the new programme to come starting Jan 2010.  I see Linley Marthe is coming in the winter.  He was Joe Zs last electric bass player in the Syndicate, and man could he lay down the world music bass line and groove.

			Hey, is anyone going to the Amon Amarth concert at Volkshaus on this Sunday? 
I was also wondering, do you think I'd be allowed to take a pocket digital camera with???
		 
			
			Not going to this one...I've seen them a few times and found them somewhat lackluster live.    
Enjoy the show - hope they put on a good one! And nice to see another metalhead 'round these parts    
			
			Really, lackluster? Hmmm, well I'm sure to me it'll be awesome. I've never been to a concert before.
		    Oh dear...yes, you'll come from a completely different perspective. I'm a bit old and jaded.    
Have a great time!!   
(and if the singer's beard is still as long as it was before, don't let yourself become transfixed by how it moves - or not - when he sings, heh...)
		    First time at a concert, Amon Amarth will be a lot of fun. They are very popular. And of course there will be loud, distorted guitars and grunting like a dog singing, which are both great.   
I don't quite understand why Amarth are so popular, as there are dozens of more interesting death metal bands around. I think it's because not only do they sing about Vikings, they look like Vikings.   
I see a lot of people taking pictures at such gigs - usually with their phones. I don't think you'd have a problem with a small camera, but don't quote me on that!   
Have fun!
		    I put it down to their music and image. Their image goes great with the theme and mythology they sing about, their music generally feels ""strengthening"" like you can take on the world. Vocals are not too distorted so you can't understand but growled enough to be really metal. Plus they do that synchronized hair spin which is both corny funny and awesome! Behind Rammstein my favourite band!!!
		 
			
			So, how was it?!
		 
			
			Not as good as Nile will be tomorrow night in Pratteln (Basel) I trust.   \m/
		    Heh, Nile does do a much better show than Amon Amarth, definitely    
			
			Damn I'm sorry I missed this. Anybody else in the same genre coming that you know of?  
Kinda new here
		 
			
			There's a couple of death metal acts coming in to   (shudder, not my favorite place) just outside Basel.

			Does anybody here plan to see Leonard Cohen in Strassburg on March 5th? Who joins me? Saw him 3 times, he is brilliant even live in concert. Strassburg is the nearest city to see him on his current tour.
		     
Are you a concert organiser by any chance ?
		 
			
			A concert organizer who makes publicity maybe u think? No just a huge music fan and Strasboug is not that far, only 1.5 h from Basel. Do u join me?
		 
			
			I'd be interested. Strassburg is always nice to go to and Cohen fits avec la ambiance    
			
			yes Strasbourg is beautiful
		 
			
			Saw him back in Canada in September, he was awesome.  Don't expect as much banter with the audience like his ""Life in London"" CD, but very worthwhile seeing a Montreal legend.  I do hope I am that full of life when I'm 75!
		    Tempted... Have a lot of his music.

12.12.2009 - 13.12.2009      : Musical Theater Basel                        
 The Nutcracker (Russian: Щелкунчик, Shchelkunchik), Op. 71, is a fairy tale-ballet in two acts, three scenes, by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, composed in 1891–92. Alexandre Dumas père´s adaptation of the story ”The Nutcracker and the Mouse King” by E. T. A. Hoffmann was set to music by Tchaikovsky (staged by Marius Petipa and commissioned by the director of the Imperial Theatres Ivan Vsevolozhsky in 1891). In Western countries, The Nutcracker has become perhaps the most popular of all ballets, performed primarily around Christmas time.   
The composer made a selection of eight of the numbers from the ballet before the ballet´s December 1892 premiere, forming The Nutcracker Suite, Op. 71a, intended for concert performance. The suite was first performed, under the composer´s direction, on 19 March 1892 at an assembly of the St. Petersburg branch of the Musical Society. The suite became instantly popular (according to Men of Music ”every number had to be repeated”), but the complete ballet did not begin to achieve its great popularity until around the mid-1950s.    
Among other things, the score of The Nutcracker is noted for its use of the celesta, an instrument that the composer had already employed in his much lesser known symphonic ballad The Voyevoda (premiered 1891). Although well-known in The Nutcracker as the featured solo instrument in the ”Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” from Act II, it is employed elsewhere in the same act.
		 
			
			what a ....   unusual   performance... with very little ballet in it...  
the pictures they used to advertise are way too misleading...    
Not recommending at all   Cannot remember now the name of choreographer, but certainly would think twice when going to any of his performances...

			November 10th, Geneva.   
December 6 & 7th, Zurich.
		 
			
			Will 100% make it to one of them...
		 
			
			I've tickets for Dublin and Zurich.    
			
			Argh, I hate it when a tour extension is announced later.   
I'm going to the one in Milan on the 18th of June. If it's mindblowingly good and tickets are still available a few months before, I'll maybe go to the Geneva one, too.   
I've already seen them live 4 times in my life, so two times this year may be pushing it.
		 
			
			I hear ya- that's how I ended up with Dublin and Zurich... of course it was me and only me that hit ""confirm"".    
I'm counting on you for a review!
		 
			
			Is there still tickets?    
What is the best site?
		 
			
			Ticketcorner for CH
		 
			
			I doubt the one in Geneva will sell out any time soon. It'll be largest indoor show ever in Swizerland, with 20,000 seats available. Last time they came they played at the Arena, where the capacity is less than 10,000 and it took a few months for it to sell out.
		 
			
			To get you in the mood Russkov 'cause you're first (not that you need it).           Ah, the '98 tour. That was the first time I saw them live. I was only 13, too. Memories...   
What do you guys think of the new album? I wasn't sure at first, but it's a grower.
		    I'm still in the ""not sure"" stage.
		 
			
			Thanks for the reminder
		 
			
			My wife is a huge DM fan so we have tickets for Zurich on the 6th       Achhhhh.....ball bags, got tix for Munich June 13 already- will do likewise though, if good, will buy tix for Zch gig.
		    Thank you so much. I'm always out for new expletives where I can find them.   
*writes down*
		    Only listened to it a handful of times so still in the 'unsure' phase...I'm hoping it's a grower.  My fave album so far is exciter.   
DM have some absolute quality stuff ,fact.....but some earlier tracks on the singles collection are utter tosh.   
Still, am looking forward to seeing them live for the first time in June.
		 
			
			Hope Dave will get better!!!   
I had a ticket for Bulgaria but the concert was canceled (actually in many European concerts were cancelled) 
Happy that I will have a 2nd chance in Zurich. if everything is OK!!!
		 
			
			The Mode in Munich were A*W*E*S*O*M*E and Dave's still got 'it'!  Seriously tempted to buy tix for Zurich.
		    Good to hear. Two more days!!!
		    You didn't sell them?
		    Nope, still going, we just had two extra tickets (which we've sold).
		    Doh, tix for gig on 6th Dec are sold out....boo-hoo!  Anyone got a spare they want to sell?   
Failing that, anyone going on the 7th that I could tag along with?
		   You can have a look in ricardo. ch. for sure you can find and if you are lucky for a good price.     Im going on 7th            
			
			Excellent show in Milan. Seeing them in a stadium was something else.
		 
			
			Hi, anyone interested in swopping seated tix for standing tix for the 1. concert in ZH?
		 
			
			Also going on 7th with another EFer.  Floor of course.
		 
			
			Hello together (hehe), 
has anyone got a spare ticket for the DP concert in Zurich on 6th December (standing)? Please no more than 100CHF - some people are selling on Ricardo for 150CHF   and a friend of mine has bought some originally for 85!   
thanks heaps 
Assia
		 
			
			^^sorry, no info on that.   
Soo-hooo, 
 How about EFers going to Geneva, on 10th?    
I'm going to go on a limb here (after much self-debate) and ask is there by any chance some get-together (or tag-along) possible for those of us determined to go, but having no company whatsoever due to..well, being a frequent visitor and not a resident (and by those of us I mean myself  )?       
			
			So excited, going to pick up my tickets for the 10th show in Geneva, anyone coming to Geneva?
		 
			
			Hah, yup! See above.       Alright, see you there then.   
18 hours to go    
			
			You guys will love it. One of the best live bands you'll ever see.   
I was going to go, but finally decided against it. It would have been my 6th time seeing them, and in the end it felt like I was doing it just because that's what I've always done, and not out of any actual desire. I hate the feeling of going through the motions.
		 
			
			I certainly hope so! They cancelled a few days before they should have played in Belgrade, but I'm about to change that now (well, I hope, unless Dave ""eats something bad"" again  ).   
Aw, seeing them 5 times! Lucky! 
Well, impressions to come..
		 
			
			yeah, going on the 7th. in zurich. the new album is a grower. i hated ""wrong"", still not my fave track but as ususal the ""pearls"" are hidden on the rest of cd. its not their best record, but far, far better than ""playing the angel"". my fave record is ""ultra"", it was first ""violator"" that came out 1989-1990...
		 
			
			Waa, I didn't get to go.  Couldn't find tickets.     
Was it nice?   
Brian.
		 
			
			I'm reluctant to spill out a whole hymn here since I'm sorry that you didn't get to go.. but the music was incredibly precise, organisation impeccable and since I'm partial and love'm, I'll also say that I loved the set list.   
Try to catch them in Zurich        
Saddly, we had 2 tickets and tried to sell them for such a long time...
		 
			
			Word is, the crowd in Geneva was one of the worst on the tour. Not really surprising since it's Switzerland we're talking about.   
And apparently, the floor in Palexpo being inclined weirdly, anyone under 1m75 had trouble seeing the stage. Palexpo isn't really made for concerts. My brother went with two girls and afterwards asked them how it was. Their answer, ""Uhhh, the music was good, but we didn't really see anything.""
		       So, it is good that we sold our standing tickets!? The reason to do this was that we got tickets with sit places in the Hallenstadion (Zurich). This also annoying me a little bit because the people in front I am, can't block their view, but at the same time I hate sitting.    However, 4 days ago I enjoy it a lot in Stuttgart, where the atmosphere, the sound and Depeche were amazing!!!   
			
			If I can find the tickets, I'd like to go to the concert in Zurich. They were my teenage obsession (""some great reward"" and ""black celebration"" my favorite albums). I already went to a concert in Milan some years ago and it was amazing (Dave Gahan, by the way, is the sexiest guy on earth  ).
		    how many tickets are you looking for?
		 
			
			Looking forward to the show.  Never seen them live.
		 
			
			I am another person looking for 2 tickets on the 7th  .
		    Take out Karin at the next pub quiz and I'll have an extra.    
			
			Yeah, no thanks.
		 
			
			I have a ticket (standing) for the concert at Hallenstadion on Sunday 6th. But would like to swap it for a standing ticket for the concert on the next night.   
If anyone is interested in this decent proposal ?.. please PM me.

			This is  my favorite:       
Let's all have a great time tonight.
		 
			
			Went to the concert yesterday... That was the only concert I've ever walked out on...and I used to be one hell of a devoted fan ... now I find them boring, the new album has nothing new to offer -pretty lame I'd say- playing the same and same tunes, Gahan cannot sing anymore (I find it insulting towards the group's fans) and did you notice how egocentric the videos were? NOTHING NEW TO OFFER!...and of cource the crowd... !   
Just my point of view... Cheers!
		    You couldn't have waited till after the rest of us went to tonight's show to post this?!?!
		    Ooops..sorry..I deeply apologise! I forgot all about tonight's show...   
Hopefully the show was much better and you all had a superduper time!!!       Take a chill pill, your twisting my melon man.
		    Why do you think ""we stagehands and technicians"" call them  .     
Brian.
		    my point of view: Did you expect any new songs? The concert was good - nothing unexpected; I think that the objective of the tour is to get people and sing the most popular and loved pieces - that's it... (I haven't been to their concert before) the videos didn't surprise me - nothing new there either   I didn't expect anything NEW because the concert was not to present anything new   becuase there is nothing that great and that new and sufficient for 2 hrs    
But the crowd.. weird!
		      Were you guys not part of the ""crowd""? 
What was wrong with it?
		    ok we were.. let me tell you my experience... we were 4.. next to us were sitting 2 probably 20yrs old guys.. with ear plugs (and I didn't find it that laud).. but what amazed me (ok, this is my first rock concert in Switzerland) is that those guys didn't move.. didn't applaud whatsoever.. didn't stand up, no, didn't move at all.... I had a feeling that I am next to 2 sphinx (Apologies for classification). And there were quite a few like this. which is weird - if you go to a concert you go for the live performance and the music - i f you want to listen music in a calm environment and not too laud - sorry but you do this in a home environment (at least this is my perception). I felt so bad when I involuntarily hit one of the ""sphinx"" like twice...  
There were also devoted fens, enjoyting , singing and moving crowd and yes, everybody has a style and you do whatever you want to do but some things fells weird! 
And also some of the characters that you could see were.. too wasted... sort of junkies type (apologies) - at least this was my feel
		    Have you ever been to a Daft Punk concert? Be sure to go when they go on tour next time...hopefully this year...i wish...
		     
9.999 peeps multiplied by 2, roughly 20.000 tell the difference.     the new record is ok. i think its still a great record compared with ""playing the angel"". depeche mode i think has career lasting for 25yrs and more and you dont, you never will get the rolling stone-u2-feling, that you meet a machine, a conveyor belt like output.  the joy of playing they transmitted into the crowd. the old stuff still sounds box fresh and they have loads of varieties how they play the songs. (check ""freelove"" and ""home""). gahans voice is still at the height of his talent. mind that he had a cancer treatment just a couple of weeks before and chemo therapy still going, so you see? massive!   from my perspective i dont need a lightshow or any other sideshow gimmicks. im there beacuse of the music and for the dancing. i liked the images though. i think its no ego show wall but for smaller peeps to have the chance catching a bit of the action going on on the stage. two girls with me enjoyed it as they saw only arms and mobiles infront of their faces.   that gets me to rant about: clapping along to any given tune, though theres no rythm to clap along. even though i hate clapping. lighters, mobiles and cameras should be banned! how annoying! sing along and friggin dance! and give applause for the performance! thats what the audience is there for! great concert, 85chuffs well spend. looking forward to the next one.   btw: daft punk transformed into the dj bobos of dance music. using voicecoders is plain dreadful! and the project cant be compared with depeche mode: block of djay dashboard n boxes, running sounds from dat tapes and harddiscs you can barely compare! they could play all of their cds you wouldnt notice the difference. that a daftpunk gig is very energetic n crowd moving...big time! i would like to see if those guys could get the swiss mummys moving?! most boring crowd on the entire planet!       Nice to hear your thoughts but OMG dj Bobos of the dance music? That is brutal to say...and yes you could notice the difference. Apart from that there is no comparison between them...2 different genres of music...   
Anyway I still think that it was a waste of time & money and after that I decided to be more selective about the gigs I wanna attend. As for the crowd well at the Roisin Murphy & Gus Gus concert I clearly remember having a super time, everyone was dancing..I guess because there are not that mainstream as DM have become and as a result only people who really know their music go see them...

The Editors are playing (in the quiet village of Bern) on December 1st in Bierhuebli, just wondered if anybody was going? ....  Do people like the Editors?

			Hi, Yes I like the Editors.  The new album was a bit strange but I have gotten used to it now after a few listens... 
I might be interested to go see the show, but have to check my schedule...  43 francs isnt too bad...   
any one been to a show at the bierhuebeli before?

			Hi Everyone,    
is anyone going to watch Alice in Chains rocking Fribourg?       Date/Time?
		 
			
			Yeap ory for not being professional    
It is on the 3rd of December starts at 20:00:   =
		 
			
			i'm looking for a ticket.
		 
			
			Can't you buy throught the link given in above?
		 
			
			nope, sold out last week.
		 
			
			so i got an offer for a ticket online for 100chfs. apparently i'm being scalped.    
anyone going and got an extra ticket for a little cheaper? beers are on me!
		 
			
			I got a ticket for 42. Don';t buy for 100 ! did you look for a ticket in ricardo.ch?
		 
			
			i just checked - one buy it now ticket for 99chfs. looks like the same guy that offered my by email. he seems to be a professional scalper judging by his past sales.    
i'm so sad - AIC is my favorite band in the world and the new album is awesome. if you have any leads on a ticket, i'd be infinitely grateful!    
otherwise i'm just going to suck it up and pull the trigger for 100. <ouch>
		 
			
			Unfortunately I have only 2 tickets   Anyway, we would be happy to say hi in Fribourg!
		 
			
			I wanted to go, but was unsure of the overnight situation.   
I guess a sold out show decides it for me.
		 
			
			on that desperate note, hows the deal with 'outside the venue' scalpers in CH?   
Worth the trip. It would be amazing to see AIC. Their new album is decent (w. respect to the classics), but I definitely want to hear DuVall's take on the old stuff.
		 
			
			i'm thinking to go and try for a ticket outside myself. there are usually scalpers selling before the show.    
i've been in contact with the guy online who is selling for 100chfs, but it's a print-at-home ticket and i'm a bit leery about getting ripped off. seems it would be easy for him to sell more than one and then i'm SOL (unless i was lucky enough to be the first one in the show). he says he'll send me his name, address, phone but would that really do anything to secure the transaction? would the police do anything? how could i prove it? etc. seems more bother than security.
		 
			
			It think he is trying to cheat you, for 1 CHF (!) he can send you the ticket via A-Post from any point in CH to your place and it will take no more than 1-2 days to deliver it.
		 
			
			so it all depends now on whether i go skiing on friday or not. big powder happening right now.   i'll probably decide on thursday. i'll post up if i'm going.
		     
Shredding the Pow or Alice in Chains.......living in Switzerland is pretty tough at the moment.
		 
			
			In the spirit!               
			
			So the concert sucked, right?        
			
			yeah lets get some feedback?!
		 
			
			No, the concert was indeed great!
		 
			
			ok, so moving on the next metal show - MASTODON!!!   
at least thru this experience i learned in advance that they were coming and was able to get tickets.

Google translation: 
CRISTINA Branco is considered one of the most beautiful voices of fado, the Portuguese national music, which has marked them with present-day image. Melancholy, human suffering, the trials and eventual impotence of man to his fate - the favorite topics of the 36-year-old Portuguese woman belong to the quintessence of traditional fado. This does not apply to the way that treads Cristina Branco in the musical translation of their texts and ideas. It is one of the outstanding representatives of the so-called New fado, that of the conventional instruments, in contrast to the strict tradition in order to expand additional instruments such as accordion, violin and piano. Echoes of jazz and bossa nova, which is partially bold text, Cristina Branco sings, and occasionally one or two times, almost cheerful, upbeat song: With the Cristina Branco Fado arrived in the here and now. Their new album Kronos Cristina Branco describes as reflection, as an attempt to blend the past with the present to a meaningful future - as an artist and as a man.

			Hello all,   
I've heard that orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre will be performing in Basel, in StadtCasino and was surprised at the beginning: why would a leading orchestra perform in a casino. Then browsed a bit, and apparently the StadtCasino is not a casino at all?   
Could you share your impressions about the concert hall? Is is nice and spacious and with nice acoustics?   
And yes, here is the announcement for Mariinsky performance:      
They'll be performing Shostakovich, the Leningrad Symphony.
		 
			
			IT is not a bad hall, it is like a regular nothing-superb-concert hall. The problem is that you can here fire-alarms for example from the street (I didn't hear trams although I was told by friends, that you can hear that too). 
Do not expect the Berliner Philharmoker concert hall but otherwise it is like a regular old European concert hall really.  
It is an interesting program.. we can organize an event (I can get tickets with a discount)
		 
			
			""Tickets with discounts""    
I've never heard it before, but just listened to some of it and it sounds like a rich and powerful symphony. 
Maybe not necessairy an event, but we'll bump this post when booking tickets, so all who want to join hail ""yes""    
Thank you SaraCan   "	2	2	 Sep 2009	['89', '45']	Stadt-Casino Basel	Natachika	157	1733	Concerts

			My brother, Benjamin, is a Concert Pianist, currently living in the UK, but is available for hire should anyone be interested - I live in Zurich, and I know he would be really keen on an opportunity to play over in Switzerland (any region).  He is a graduate of Trinity College Of Music, London and has many, many years of experience.  He is an excellent pianist, as I hope the following links will show.  Please PM me if interested in hiring him for a concert/gig.  Thanks.        I really really like his interpretation of Rachmaninov's piano concerto. Making me go really green with envy here.      
Does he have an agent? They are your best bet to get him performances with the Zurich Tonehalle and the ones down in Geneva and Lucern.
		 
			
			Yes - he is very good, thank you I will pass that on! - no, he doesn't have an agent, though not really sure where to look for one?
		    Er, how did he get the gig to perform the Rachmaninov concerto then?    
Cant help at all about where to find an agent. I only know of the traditional route -  contacts during your conservatory days and entering competitions to get noticed. Agents tend to find you that way if they are keen on representing you. Sorry am not more help - but your brother's very talented. Good luck.
		    He had an old piano teacher that is based in a church, that's where the rach3 was performed.  Thank you for your help, I appreciated it - I will perhaps have a look at agents to see whether any of them can help.   
Thanks again!

			Woohoo Temper Trap tonight... looking forward to it!          
And make sure you get there early enough for The Joy Formidable. They may be the better band.
		    Have just had a listen...pretty good. Think we could be in for a treat tonight...
		 
			
			Joy Formidable and Temper Trap were great tonight   
I do love the Abart! up close and personal   
shame about the sound tonight though in parts       
			
			OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD   
Last night was one of, if not THE best live gig I have ever heard, barring a couple of sound issues.   
Joy Formidable were good, 'nothing special', but Temper Trap? Oh my god, the hairs on my neck were standing on end, they were simply electrifying... and everyone I was with thought so too. Simply mind-blowing, and they are going to be one of the biggest bands of 2010 without a doubt.    
Awesome, awesome night. My lady friends got to chat to the Joy Formidable women too but I didn't get chance, though she was hanging round by the stairs all night. Too distracted by the fitfitfit rock chicks that go there for every gig.    
			
			Yep temper trap killed it. The lead singer can totally wail. Great night   
Oh but yeah....some sound issues where I was
		 
			
			Yeah pretty good concert. Temper Trap Rocked! 
Was pleasantly surprised by Joy Formidable as well.   
Only dampener was that they only played for an hour and then just buggered off without an encore...   
			
			Absolutely gutted to miss The Joy Formidable! REALLY like them and wish I paid more attention to this thread! Cradle is one of my most favourite songs of this year and was very probably listening to it on the train back from Zürich when they were on stage last night. Mikey is a sad panda!!
		 
			
			Totally surprised by how good Temper Trap were. I like the CD but was expecting them to try and reproduce it live having seen a few videos. But they had a much more rocky sound which worked really well. The singers voice almost breaks on the high notes though. Yes they should have played an encore but I suppose they don't have enough material yet.   
It was a real shame that The Joy Formidable had electrical problems. Hopefully they will come back real soon. And the live CD will be in my letter box any day now.
		    Yeah I forgot to mention that... it seemed REALLY short. All of us were left begging for more and we felt a little short-changed at the end, and I was really geared up for more.    
			
			Yeah I was really geared up after they played ""Science of Fear"". 
Too bad it just finished after that.
		    is this a FAIL of the DAY Mikey    
Consider yourself told, keep up to date on here to be in the know    
			
			That was indeed one quality gig last night.  Thought both bands were excellent.  Temper Trap's music really does come into it's own when you hear it live, and thought the lead singer of Joy Formidable had a great stage presence...she seemed really nice too when i chatted to her later in the night (well, she at least listened to my drunken ramblings politely so that's good enough for me!).  And despite the technical glitch during the Joy Formidable's set, really liked Abart as a venue.    
Here's hoping both bands come back to Zurich sometime in 2010.
		    Yep my favourite song by far. My mate apparently was talking to the lead singer afterwards and said that ""it was a great gig, except I was expecting more"".

			I cannot recommend a musical more.  I saw this in Geneva and it was absolutely fantastic.  I'll be going again the next chance I get!
		 
			
			It sure is fantastic... I'm not a huge Abba fan but absolutely loved what they did with their records to make this musical.    
			
			and to Basel for a pretty long run at the Musical Theater - (maybe the thread title could reflect this?)   
13.04.10 - 30.05.10   
I've seen the show twice in Dublin, but I think the company has probably changed personnel enough in three years that I might be able to justify another go.

			Saw PT playing the Hammersmith Apollo last Friday (October 9) and they absolutely kicked proverbial a$$. Strange watching them from seated arena however, in all my 16 years of fanning for these guys, I've never sat thru a show before - but I know that Wettingen, AG doesn't have a chair in sight!
		 
			
			Very nice gig even thou audience was quite static. But definitely very good performance from PT. 
I appreciate that they have played also their older songs in the second half  - It seems to me that the The Incident is more sentimental, acoustic. 
Amazing end of the show.
		 
			
			Yeah, good gig in a pretty average (read boring sports center) location. This band just rocks IMO.    
Best song just had to be ""Time Flies"" the Floydesque nod towards ""Sheep"" was appreciated. You would have been a bit lost in the first section if you hadn't invested in ""The Incident"" however.
		 
			
			They dropped ""Lazarus"" from other sets they've played on this tour. Probably got pi$$ed at all the fans ignoring their no-smoking requests in Aargau.   
Strange how PT attract a more or less heavy metal type following in Switzerland and Germany, yet in the UK you get a bunch of well dressed forty something taking wives and girlfriends.

			Does anyone have any experience of taking a camera to concerts in Switzerland?   
Is it allowed? If not then do they confiscate at the door?
		 
			
			These days every Tom, Dick and Harry has a phone with a camera. Most 
compact cameras are sleek and deliver good quality.   
Digital SLRs of course are not allowed.    Where as compact cameras and 
phones are usually tolerated (from my experience).     
Remember to set your ev to -1.0 to -2.0 to compensate for the hard  
lighting and (usual) dark background.
		 
			
			They generally have a cloakroom/counter where you can leave bags and coats. These will also take care of forbidden articles.   
Interchangeable lenses seems to be the dividing line for many events - compacts and phone cameras are OK, anything more advanced is not allowed. Usually the bigger the artist, the more restrictive.    
Prince at the Hallenstadion - security was actively identifying people in the audience and gesturing for them to stop. Same with Alicia Keyes in Locarno - there, her personal crew was identifying people from the side of the stage during the performance. One guy who had a DSLR and didn't stop taking pictures had to surrender his batteries to a very large security guy who went into the crowd to get this guy to stop.
		 
			
			LOL... sounds familiar, at the Gronemeyer concert in Vaduz, one bozo  
with a radio wanted to lock up my camera after the fourth song (three 
were allowed for authorized photographers with big cameras from the  
side of the stage).   
He claimed I was taking more pics after the end of the third song... I  
told him he was full of poo-poo and escorted myself out of the stadium. 
I had enough photos from the stage from the three songs anyway!   
To the OP, keep it compact and there should be no problem.
		 
			
			Pet Shop Boys at the Maag Event hall - no one gave a sh!t about my Sony cybershot. No one checked and no one dragged me out when I took videos.    
Linkin Park at the Hallestadion was a bit stricter. They were checking everyone in the queue. I shoved my camera right at the bottom of my bag and the security thankfully missed it. That being said, everyone were taking pictures when the concert started so security might have missed alot.    
I dont think you will be able to get away with the big fancy cameras though.
		 
			
			I have no interest in the big events. More the places like Mascotte and Abart. If only I had a decent compact that I could shove in a pocket       I've had no problem at Abart with an SLR, but I believe it will depend on the artist playing.    
I've encountered problems with Z-7, and refuse to even go there now (they once denied my entrance supported not only by a press request but also a record label request...I had to grab a member of one the bands to get me in with the camera).
		 
			
			Cameras, as well as mobile phone use, are getting more common at concerts.  They can be very distracting and concerts can lose some atmosphere if too many people are filming, or waving their mobiles about for their mates to hear where they are.   
I have been guilty of using a camera at concerts in UK.  Security took a disliking to me using video at a Deep Purple concert. Perhaps security should control these a bit more.    
If possible try to blag you way to the press area at the front.  I managed this at a couple of concerts.    
			
			At the WWE in Geneva cameras were not allowed in. No point really as most people had camera phones. Security at the entrance were doing a very good job though checking every single bag. I didnt see a single camera inside
		    Security was checking very carefully at the main stage at the Montreux Jazz festival. So thorough that many people missed the beginning of the show.   
I think Volkshaus usually allows cameras but when we went to see Anathema opening for Porcupine Tree, the bands have a very strict no-camera policy.
		    I have never had a bag checked or anything at the abart, but then getting a DSLR out at the abart might not be very conspicuous    
			
			It's not so much the photos that are the problem at most concerts, but the 80% of the population who cant turn the (useless) flash off. Imagine looking into a darkened crowd with flashes randomly going off. So security puts in a blanket ban so there is no need for discretion.   
BTW I so love being at a gig with 10 mobile phones being held up in front between me and the stage. Such great photos result I'm sure    
			
			Are cameras allowed at indoor sports events? I'm going to the Swiss indoors tennis in Basel and would like to bring my DSLR but don't want to get denied.
		    You are welcome to borrow my pink compact!        
I decided to give it a try last night. Simply walked in with a DSLR in a bag. Didn't get checked at the door so it was no problem. Got chatting to a guy shooting for 20 minutes who said that they were using the three song rule   In about song six a security guy asked me to stop and I tried explaining that I was non commecial. I even had a chat with the band management who told me that if I was non commercial I shouldn't even have a pro camera there. So I didn't take anymore but I am quite happy with what I got and will probably try again somewhen.       you are such a rebel   (will check out the pics)
		    Those are great pics, what kind of lens were you using?
		    Canon Eos 40D with 17-40 F4 mostly at 1600 ISO
		    Impressive, very little noise in them!   
*goes off to the corner and curses her Nikon*
		    Why do you say that?? I love my Nikon!! Here are my       Very good lighting on that stage....lights at shows I shoot are always problematic, unfortunately. I guess I still prefer my film camera    
			
			lights at all concerts are always tricky... It's always a matter of timing. But yes, film is altogether something different and special! These days, I'm glad I don't need to think about having enough film when I head out the door.    
			
			I took a camera (small pocket sized Sony) to a music concert in Volkshaus, Zurich yesterday and they didn't stop me at the door or tell me not to take photos. If you've got a smallish camera that fits the pocket its all good.

			Firstly, Mascotte were annoying.  Despite having a ticket I had to queue for so long that I missed the first two songs.  Grrrrr.   
Secondly, although I like their recordings I don't think the XX's music is that suited to a large-ish venue.  Any place bigger than Mascotte would definitely have failed.  As it was the performance was a bit boring . . .  the music's probably more suited to listening to at home.   
An underwhelming gig.

Thanks for the review...   
			
			I'm so please I sold my ticket to someone else... in the end I was too knackered to go, and from the sounds of it I didn't miss much...

			mr. commercial soundtracker? the last album was a really bad. 
ive seen him 2-3 times and the concerts are class and very dancy. 
but if he can get the swiss crowd movin' ??
		    Flow Hun, it is a challenge for any ""artist"" to get the Swiss moving... and I'm not only talking about music.      kissssssss   
			
			a HUGE challenge   
in any possible way... unsheakable!
		 
			
			I am a definite maybe for Moby.    
I have seen him live twice, and thoroughly enjoyed his performance both times. And yes he can get the Swiss crowds moving: at least he did at Paleo Festival.
		 
			
			My DJ Shadow can beat up your Moby. While wearing a fur coat.    
			
			Never seen him live - but heard him as a DJ. He played strictly classics and couldn't mix... but the vibe was insane - he had the crowd in his hand!
		 
			
			Good concert - very typical Mobyish sounds and lights; played most of his big tracks!
		 
			
			the most interesting thing about that man is that he's apparently neighbours with Bowie.
		 
			
			Thought it was great; it was a concert, then a rave, then a concert, then a rave and so on. I would definitely go again,  no hesitation.

Ohhh, I didn't even see that.

			hello all!   
I have an extra ticket to the Mando Diao concert in Winterthur on Thursday the 29th OCtober. I have to work late that day so im gutted that i cant go!    
Date: 29.10.2009 
Time: 19.00 
Location: Winterthur (details on ticket)  
Price: 68 CHF   
I know its useless to sell just one ticket, but if your friends are going and you cant get a ticket, then this is perfect! and its pretty close to Zurich.    
Have a good day everyone! PM me if you're interested.

			Let me know when and where if you guys wana meet up (before would be a better idea I think!)?    
I'm a newbie in Zurich as are some of my friends coming along so might be a good opportunity to meet some new, hopefully like-minded  folk!

			I'm travelling from Valais for the concert tomorrow,going on my own so would be nice to catch up with a few people if it's not too late to organise?!
		    I haven't heard anything from the OP and other attendees, but you are more than welcome to meet up with us before/during...we are 3 EFers, possibly 4, so the more the merrier. No solid plans yet, but will PM you contact details so we can arrange today/tomorrow, if you want.   
Dan
		 
			
			Hmmm . . . what's a good bar around Bellevue?
		 
			
			Odean is just around the corner
		 
			
			I have a spare ticket available for tonight if anyone is interested?
		 
			
			what time do you think they will come on? the tickets say 7:30 start....
		    main act usually comes on around 2100
		 
			
			I'm not sure if anyone has made any firm plans to meet up so i'll say that I will be in the odean from 7.30 until 8ish.... I also have one spare ticket if anyone needs one?   
Dan
		 
			
			This was one of the best gigs I've been to in Zürich.  I had been rather sceptical before the show, but the performance just blew me a way.  Dramatic in the best way.
		    Pretty special performance I thought, at a great, and very orderly (?!) venue!!   I hope that was the first of many great gigs to see in Zurich.    
One thing though, and I wonder whether any one else can pitch in too here...but I thought the crowd was a tad on the quiet side - is this normal in der Schwiez?   
Sorry to those I didn't manage to meet up with; I guess my post 1.5hrs before the proposed meet up wasn't one of my best pieces of planning...  Anyway, hope to meet up at the next one...   
Dan
		    Normally much quieter and more orderly than a UK gig audience, at least from my experience so far in Zürich.  The Florence and the Machine crowd was actually more lively than many I've been to!
		 
			
			In case anyone missed my other thread I took a few pictures of    
I had been putting off buying the album for a while but when I got concert tickets I took the plunge. It is much better than I was expecting - I think I don't like the videos for the singles. And on Saturday they were fantastic. Much more rocky than I was expecting especially when I saw the harp on stage. They were obviously enjoying the last night of the tour.     
Oh and we were in Odeon but didn't know that people were meeting there so wasn't looking for people.
		 
			
			Hello all,  
Apologies fopr opening the thread then doing nothing to organise a meet-up beforehand! Getting hold of a ticket and heading over to Zurich was all a bit last-minute.   
Thanks again to Gastro Gnome & Depeche for a top night!

I live in Basel and it frustrates me when I miss decent concerts because of the lack of information in the newspapers  AC/DC in Zürich for example, which I would have loved to have seen.     Perhaps there are good websites to keep an eye on?     Thanks for any suggestions.     John.   
			
			I use this one that someone posted up here a while ago        is also worth checking out to see what's going on in any given city.   
But if you want to see specific bands, it's usualy best to check their own sites.

Or regularly check ticketcorner.com or starticket.ch

for germany:  
for france:

			I'm surprised they're still going. They were never the same for me after Fish left.   
I kind of grew up listening to Script for a Jesters tear, Fugazi and Misplaced Childhood. However I felt that the last album to feature Fish - Clutching at Straws - was indeed that.
		 
			
			The Fish era concluded in 1988, since then (21 years) their lead singer has been Steve Hogarth ""h"". They have now released 15 albums and were the first rock group to really use the internet to interact with their fans and also pre-finance their forthcoming work. Their last studio album ""Happiness Is The Road"" was an absolute belter - great atmospherics, good songs and pure musicianship.

			hi everyone,   
I'll go to the summerdays fest on friday, from Zurich. I'll leave Zurich  HB around 18:00 pm. (I think there's a train at about 18:37 smt. which will take 1:30 hours to Arbon.) And I'll return at night, no camping.   
I cannot go earlier bec. I have an exam at 16:30 =s    
If there is someone who will go at around that time of the day, we can go together, or I can join you =)    
velican.
		 
			
			If anyone has a couple of spare tickets for Friday 28th I would buy them at a premium. I have a couple of unexpected visitors who want to go.
		 
			
			Awesome!   
Just back from the Friday event.  The Heep and Purple were a true 
experience!     
Will have something ready soon here... especially for DP    
			
			OK... 
It is not professional (most taken amongst the pushing and shoving  
crowd. 
It is not of the highest quality. 
It is hard stop and start, not smooth transitions. 
It is small and hard to see. 
It is long (~19 minutes). 
It is a flash video. 
It has a long blank between groups.   
But... 
It is fresh.   
And... 
It is   to see.   
 Ignore the ~1 minute blank after the Uriah Heep. 
Best to download the link to your computer and play it locally. 
The file size is ~45 MB so be patient, let it load - it will start... 
eventually  
Also, during the first couple minutes of Deep Purple, you can tell where 
I was standing by the (over modulated) sound that comes across in the 
video.  The others are hardly audible from that position.
		 
			
			Thanks for that. Will look when I a

		    cheers Martin, I know the Alzheimers will have caught up with me by August and I will surely need this transcript to remind me    
update: me not booked tickets - Nige and Annie - you might have your group gate crashed with non zurichers now

			Help....   
I despereately need a Ticket for the Muse gig in ZH. I am only looking for a standing ticket.   
Thank you...
		    There are plenty on ebay and ricardo if you are prepared to pay over the odds - the standing tickets sold out within a few hours of them going on sale - we only got seating tickets    
Seats are still available however on ticketcorner
		 
			
			muse gig seated? no way! unless i havent heard the latest record...i dont buy any ticket. have seen them 6times by now and met them backstage in 2002 rock im park. but i suppose theyll rip-off the bloody roof, man!
		 
			
			We've seen them at Gampel. On our honeymoon   
That was by far the best gig I've seen. 
Think I bite the bullett and go for the ricardo prices.    
You only live once      yeah yeah rub it in! seen em twice, will go again even though seated   still looking for cheap standing tickets on ricardo and ebay on the run up
		    just bought mine on ricardo. what a bargain that was. NOT. but hey...
		    How much if you don't mind me asking?
		    only 119.00 SFR      .........each?
		 
			
			thats for one
		    holy cow, devotee!?    
			
			just wait until 1-2 weeks to the concert, there are always people, who 
can't go to the concert, because of many reasons. 
Look AT RICARDO, kijji or Ebay.ch and you have the chance to make a bargain.
		 
			
			I'm obviously getting old - but what is SO wrong with seating? 
Rather sit than miss out.....     
(Hope this doesnt start one of those good old EF debates)        yes you are an old fart       I'd say so.  
In my rating one of the 3 best live bands in the world   
			
			Have you heard the new track  
Music LOL of the year       hows it called? the last record was really laughable, thats why i didnt buy a ticket as i thought it could be worse than that....
		    Are you ready for this?....     
'United States of Eurasia'             
(Matt Bellamy's also a certified conspiraloon apparently)
		       
sorry, but this is QUEEN??!!?? awful! the video, lyrics, singing...OMG! 
theyre over, big time!
		    It's sooooooooooo bad, isn't it?   
I haven't seen the vid, and honestly can't bring myself to have to hear the track again in order to watch it, so I'll take your word on that!
		 
			
			I have to unfortunately agree it isn't their finest hour   hope the rest of the new album isn't the same as this    
I did actually like their last album but still prefer Origin of Symmetry and Absolution more

			Just going on sale Linkin park at the Hallenstadion    
28.07.09       
			
			Sick, I've been wanting to see them for a while.
		 
			
			Anyone going to this?  I am planning to
		 
			
			i will be there, i am a member of the linkin park underground. 
It will be my 6 th concert in about 2 years
		 
			
			I remember the crunching sound of our babysitter stepping on a cabin I had just finished- wait, sorry that was Lincoln Logs.
		 
			
			I'm going too ! So excited as it's gonna be my first Linkin park concert. 
let me know if there's anyone wanna meet up there   
			
			Am going!!!!! Ridiculously excited! Deliberating if I should go for the opening act though..       By the way, what is the opening act? I'm too lazy to look it up and my girfriend has the tickets.
		    A welsh rock band called "" "".    
			
			Checked out the link but did not find any price info or availability. Was thinking of just turning up and hope to still get a ticket tonight.   
Has anyone confirmed meeting or meeting at the entrance and enjoyed the concert as a group together?   
Thanks.
		 
			
			Sick concert, but a little short.    
We were late getting in and only got the end of the support group who were pretty good and made much more effort to interact with the crowd then Linkin Park themselves.

			Bump,  just a reminder, the Blue Balls festival starts this weekend.  Great atmsophere, the usual festival fare is there, beer tents, good mix of food stalls, and the usual festival trinkets.  You won't get many big names playing outside for free, but the music is always topnotch with a good variety of styles.   
As stated before, everything outside is free, though people will ask you to buy a badge, I've been informed it's only 20CHF for the entire festival this year, I think it's something worth supporting.
		 
			
			Im looking to go next Saturday for Joss Stone (supporting the Cornish massive) :-) Tickets look to be 75chf each, but you say outside is free. What's normally outside do you know?
		 
			
			It's split between 2 main areas, either side of the bridge.    
Directly outside the front of the KKL, there's usualy a band or performer, but not sure which ones from the listing, as they're all listed as KKL   
Also, there's been a 2 man band or similar outside the schweirzerhof, the guys last year were really pretty good.   
Then a bit further down is the pavillion, the focus of the free event, a variety of bands play and there's a big crowd.   
As mentioned before, there are plenty of stalls along the lake side, around the KKL and the Pavillion, featuring some excellent and diverse foods, beers, and festival stuff (clothes/pipes/trinkets etc).   
You can get a day sticker or a badge for the entire event quite cheaply, this gets you into the schweizerhof for the nightclub, on the ferry from the pavillion to the KKL and stops the stewards from hassling you to buy a badge (mostly).
		    I'd book in advance btw.
		 
			
			Thought this took place in mid-winter   
			
			Hello paople,    
I am looking for a partner in crime for James Morrison tonight.    
I have a spare ticket, they were 75 CHFs.    
If required I would be happy to post an image of it, but it is prolly not required as I will be meeting you there to hand it over.
		 
			
			I have  ticket to the Joss Stone performance this Saturday night. Last minute plans means I can't make it at all  . Willing to sell it for CHF60 (as opposed to CHF75)    
Will send by A-post so that you have it first thing Friday/Saturday morning. Please let me know!

			......erm see above. thats all.
		 
			
			Another kinda underwhelming line up.       
			
			Nothing huge in there, but I'm thinking of going to either see Moby or the Prodigy.    
Since I can hear the Festival from my balcony I don't think travel and accommodation costs will be too high    
			
			humm - i checked the site and it says from the 22nd...I see the line up but no tickets - are they available elsewhere?
		 
			
			I think tickets are on sale from next week sometime.
		 
			
			I feel like the line-up is almost 1997 revisited with a sprinkling of more modern stuff.
		 
			
			Well I'm sure the recession had something to do with it. Large Global record companies not wanting to spend any money on sending acts to lowly Switzerland.    
Tickets go on Sale Next Wednesday 22nd April
		 
			
			Not sure about that as it'd be just another stop on a European tour. I'm sure it is more to do with the organisers knowing that people in Romandie are starved of live music and many will go to anything that is on.
		 
			
			TBH I find some of the comments on here a bit harsh. According to rumours they were trying to get Bruce Springsteen but gave up because of the cost.    
I don't find the program that bad, what were you guys expecting?   
True they have already invited people like Placebo, the Young Gods, The Prodigy, Bénabar or Raphael several times but they reinvite them because they are good and popular not because they don't have other options.   
Also getting NTM to play when they have just reformed is IMO quite good.
		 
			
			so is anyone going?
		 
			
			I think so, since their web site has all but one Day Friday tickets left available.
		    id like to go on friday to see the man with the(burberry) hat! 
so is anyone going on 7/24?   
i dont have a ticket yet but i hope ill get one next days, maybe get one on ebay...109chf at the moment...
		 
			
			ok, got one for friday, 24.juli. is anyone going that day? 
maybe from zurich?
		 
			
			Anyway one got tickets for paleo..........just want to go one night.... an open to any band offers..??
		 
			
			Hi All,   
I have one ticket for sale 22 of July ... line up is: Franz Ferdinand, The Prodigy ... I sell it at purchase price.

			Hello everyone,  
you may have heard of my night previously with my ex partner when it was at the Zodiac Club.  
I am now on my own and have moved to a new location The Hiltl Bar/Lounge (part of the veggi place near Jelmoli) and ENTRY IS COMPLETELY FREE!!! 
I fly two musicians from London especially to play the night and I also give a slot to a local artist to show support for the local folk/acoustic scene too. So that's three musicians in one night all for FREE!! 
playing will be 
Timothy Jaromir CH 
Fiona Bevan GB 
Sam Beer GB 
Show starts at 9pm and will wrap up around 2330-2400 ish.... 
If you like this kind of music please come and show your support, I only have one chance to make it work in this venue.... 
In the future I may try and do this night independantly from clubs/bars so if there are anybody with good british ale contacts please get in touch...  
hope to see a good turnout  
cheers 
David from the underground sessions
		 
			
			Er, it would help if we knew which night your show is on  .   
You may want to contact SwissBob if you're looking for Ale brewers.
		 
			
			Is this a ""sit down at a table"" event - Relaxed, chilled jazz lounge feel?   
Or more, stand-up and smoke-filled crowded concert feel?
		 
			
			Yeh cheers for the tip....it was last night 
and I try to achieve that lounge type feel for my evenings candles on the tables etc... I think acoustic music is best served in such a setting....of course theres always a little moshing space up front 
was a great night thanks to all that came and I hope to see you all at the next one....I may try and organise my own venue for the next one.... 
and thanks for the beer tip 
cheers!

The superstar revealed this summers gigs will be his curtain call during a bizarre appearance at the O2 arena in South East London.  
Emotional Jacko, 50, said: This is it. I mean it. This is it.  
The star, who The Sun revealed is receiving treatment for a severe MRSA-type infection, added: When I say this is it, I mean this is it, because...  
He then paused, placed his hands over his heart and bowed his head.            
Jacko is to perform at least ten shows at the O2 beginning in July.  
He kept fans waiting for 1Ѕ hours before his announcement yesterday. Jacko, introduced by X Factor host Dermot OLeary, finally walked on giggling, waving and blowing kisses.  
The Thriller singer gushed: I love you so much. These will be my final show performances in London. Ill be performing the songs my fans want to hear.  
This is the final curtain call. Ill see you in July. And I love you. You have to know that. I love you, from the bottom of my heart.            
			
			Let's hope"" this is it ""...it's long overdue (his retirement, I mean!!)
		    My sentiments entirely. Good riddance to the nasty, creepy, little paedo'   Why on earth is he even allowed to visit Britain?
		    I wish that his last trip to the UK had been.
		 
			
			Sadly he said these are his last ""London"" shows -- good lord knows where else he'll bestow his ""final curtain call"" and for how many more years to come.
		 
			
			'This is it' is actually an old Dan Hartman song, plagiariser!!!!
		 
			
			Part of me wants to go and feel the excitement from the crowd and hear those old songs. But the other part is wary of waiting for hours at a performance that turns out to be awful because, let's be honest, he really doesn't look like he has ""it"" anymore. Who knows. And for his personal issues? Sigh...
		 
			
			I bought tickets.    
			
			Oh, poor you!!
		 
			
			Are there any discounts for kids, I mean if you leave them there?
		    Ow! I'm in a State Of Shock.   
Ow 
Wow 
Ow
		    Wasn't he found 'not guilty' ...I'm not a great fan of him myself these days but what has an MJ concert in the UK got to do with a US court case that didn't prove him guilty of child molestation?
		 
			
			Absolutely, he wasn't found guilty and OJ Simpson was a just a great actor in the Naked Guns series who was type cast as the ex. NFL running back. The 2.3M people currently sitting in US jails can't be wrong....
		 
			
			Go Rabina!!!
		 
			
			Is this still a concert thread?
		 
			
			Quite right. 
I hear Michael Jackson's doing a final concert......
		 
			
			Well if he's taken a look at the man in the mirror lately he'll know that he won't be able to put on a thriller, it will certainly be bad and after the show he'll have to beat it pretty quick.    
I'll get my coat!
		    Valid comment... My finger torn between pressing THX button for chasing the pedo... and GRN button... as he plays good music! So to say balance is restored.    
Btw: With his music demise, the era of my 80's youth is gone with the wind as well   luckily aunty Tina Turner is still around and touring       Like you really know anything at all...what has the MJ case have to do with OJ Simpson's?   
MJ is maybe quite eccentric but nevertheless a very talented performer & recording artist, the shows are sure to be brilliant considering his back catalogue (& he has said he will perform some of it) & the fact that there are many people who will go just to see an icon, so the atmosphere will be electric.
		    So are you saying pedo+good music=OK? 
Come back Gary Glitter          What?   
Why are you all going on about something the OP didn't mention at all?   
Well I suppose he did quote The Sun which I would imagine is a very popular UK newspaper with some of those who have made comments here...
		 
			
			[quote=transition;417455]Like you really know anything at all...what has the MJ case have to do with OJ Simpson's?   
So you don't see any similarities between famous ex. US stars who would by all accounts be convicted for major felonies based on their actions but for US justice face-saving acquittals? Hmm, must be pure co-incidence then I guess. I truly apologize for stating the blatantly bleedin' obvious. Groan yourself.
		    I am not saying anything or approving... Has there ever been any great artist without some sort of malady or psycho instability? Even famous Mozart had his moments.
		 
			
			So I now see he is doing 44 shows from July 09 through to Feb 2010   
Does anyone else think he wont do all shows? I can see people buying up all the tickets and him not being able to commit to maybe more than 10 shows?   
I saw MJ back in 88 at Wembley on the Bad tour and became a huge huge fan at 15, he was pretty amazing, Hubby asked if I wanted to go to these shows but I just think it's going to be pretty sh!t, an old has been on stage trying to make some money, he is only doing it after all because he's now skint?   
I don't deny he was once great but i think they'll be pretty poor shows in comparison to what he once was   
Nicky
		 
			
			I saw him live during his HIStory tour, in Sydney. At the time, my sister and I hoarded our pocket money for about two years to be able to afford the tickets.   
Say what you want about the man. He gets up on a stage- and is absolutely fearless about putting himself and his music forward.   
Its still the best live performance I've ever seen, more than a... eesh... dozen years later.   
Now I feel very old.
		 
			
			[QUOTE=Rabina;417523]   Whether I do or don't see any similarities is simply nothing to do with what the OP posted, if people here want to say that they don't   him & won't buy tickets fair enough.    
I personally respect the fact that he has made millions of people happy with his music including those here that want to go & see him & don't feel it necessary to disrespect their enthusiasm for his work by stating something I know very little about or have no evidence of.   
I used to love Gary Glitter's music, would have loved to have seen him live but now I don't want to know for obvious reasons, that it was   beyond any doubt that he was a paedophile.   
I just think people like you are sad, you have been taken in by the hate campaign he has had to go through in the press not just for whether he molested children (also name calling like wacko Jacko etc etc) and you freely express an opinion that is part of the same bandwagon....why not keep your cheap comments to yourself?
		 
			
			Why not start a ""Trash-the-Artist"" thread on wacked-out, drug addicted, sex addict/variant/disgusting artists- but keep this one about the concert? Some suggestions: MJ, Gary Glitter, Roman Polanski, Pee Wee Herman, Jim Morrison, Pete Doherty, Amy Wino, R Kelly, all the Rapper thugs out there...   
It's kindof funny, the remarks above that have nothing to do with the concert reminded me of what my parents said when I went to see Frank Sinatra in the '80's. How can you see him? Do you know about him and what he did and ... and ...? For me he was a legend.   
I'm going because my teen and her best friend (who  know about him) are fans and they really, really, really want to go.
		     
Envy you ...
		 
			
			You couldn't pay me to go to this. 
Most overrated artist. Ever.
		 
			
			hes not going to play one concert! and the fine for breaking the contract will kill him off. end of (mj) story.
		 
			
			Ok here's the thing... whatever you say about the man (which I am sure is all fair), how can you claim his music is overrated? ......unless you are 15, only started tuning in a decade ago and don't have any idea about music.            Isn't that a matter of taste?
		     
Yes it is, and he doesn't have any.
		    Actually, trans-whatever, Jackson paid one of the families, millions of dollars, in an out of court settlement. Hardly the actions of an innocent man. In his court case. Not guilty, is not, I am afraid, innocent. It could simply mean, that a good lawyer got him off. I had unsubscribed from this thread, because I didn't find it that interesting, however having revisited it, I can see that it has hotted up. transition, you seem to be very lonely here. Please help me make up my mind, do you support him or not, as in one post you accuse him of being a plagiariser? That doesn't make you a fan, or is this as good as Whacko's fans get?    
Do you know why Michael Jackson called one of his albums Bad?   
It was because he couldn't spell pathetic.    
			
			Whatever this sad, crazy man does in his private life....or doesn't do, as the case may be, well, I think enough comment has been made so far. 
But his music? That really is a matter of you like it or you don't.   
I think he was and still is hyped beyond belief; he's a money-making machine for a huge set-up and they want to make sure he delivers.   
I didn't like his stuff in the Eighties and I don't now. Disco cr@p!!   
But if you like him and his ""music"", then pay-up and go along -  he loves you all!!   
The only worse thing I can think of is Cliff Richard    
			
			By the time the ""80's"" came around he had already made 5 solo albums.  So like I said, if you are 15 years old I will accept that you might not have too much of an idea about his earlier work.   
Having said that, Thriller (1982) still holds the record for selling over 100 million copies.   
I would argue it was ""quite"" good.         
			
			I was 15 in 1981, so I (unfortunately) remember a fair bit of it.....and the later stuff was 'orrible. 
Does anyone remember ""Blöd on the Dance Floor""??       Well, I,m not arguing here anymore and I agree 100% with raincookie.  You either like his stuff or you don't.  I don't see age coming into it either. At 15, my son was into Bob Marley and he'd been dead, a long time before my son was even born. O.K. I'll agree, that my OP wasn't about his music either.  Not one post on this thread is actually on topic, as his concert isn't even in Switzerland. I'm going to get raincookie, to elope with me and start a new thread on Cliff.  Now let me see, where would that fit in.    
			
			Yes, quite.    
Sorry, hugh abu - it's very naughty of Brightonite and me to gang up on you. 
I just read my signature and felt very guilty.... 
You are of course, entitled to like his music and go to the concerts (if there are any)  
We are now eloping with Cliff Richard, apparently....   
			
			Are you on medication?         
			
			Absolutely.
		 
			
			Suppositories I hope...
		 
			
			They're a bit chewy.......      You're meant to let them dissolve under your tongue.
		      You really are a tosser!    
Just by the sound of your posts you sound so opinionated & uneducated but the truth is you also know nothing, you just make assumptions about situations you know nothing about.   
Many celebrities with such high profiles will pay very good lawyers just to fend off bad publicity even if the allegations are untrue (Paul McCartney has done it, so has Beckham etc).    
Your joke also really sums you up, you still know nothing about me or my opinions on anything so keep digging, groaning or whatever because the reality for me is that just like some other plebs posting here - NO-ONE really asked what your personal opinions on MJ were!
		 
			
			Yes. Nothing like ranting at someone to prove your point. Well done, transition.
		    A nice cup of tea should make you feel better.       Well it's a shame you didn't step in earlier when you probably were observing how many groans I got from this stupid little clique when I wasnt't being rude, just stating my opinion (& even from bananahead who didn't even write anything)...no disrespect meant to the forum itself but I really do feel better telling him what he really is whether you think it's a rant or not.
		     Tell us another one of your hilarious jokes, read out loud more of your favourite tabloid stories today & give us your opinions on them, add a groan or 2 to my post & hey presto mate, you've just had one of the best afternoons for a long time      Im surprised that you think that calling someone a tosser isnt rude, or that calling forum members who disagree with you, a ""stupid little clique"", isnt rude.   
Im equally surprised that you are complaining about the groans that you received, when in only two pages you have handed out seven groans yourself?   
Feel free to add me as your eighth as you wish.   
Alternatively, why not also chill out a bit and not take it too seriously.... this forum and this thread is bound to invite both discussion and argument because it involves someone who, at the very least, even you would admit, is controversial.    
I get it that you are a fan of MJ, but many people are not. Personally im astonished that the english people would receive him with so much demand, to say the least. And then when i think about the less attractive facets of the English personality, im less astonished and more disappointed.   
In any case, transition, why not let the shoulders relax and enjoy the friday?
		 
			
			Transition - it was nothing personal against you. 
We just dislike MJ as much as you like him.   
But your name-calling is very personal and immature. 
I didn't mind it when hugh_abu asked if I was ""on medication""  
but I suspect Brightonite didn't feel too happy at being openly called a tosser.   
Are you all part of MJ's defence team that you respond so vehemently? 
My teenage daughter disses my musical tastes all the time, but I don't have a go at her for it........maybe she's right anyway    
			
			Pf, never! What do teenagers know about music, anyway?
		 
			
			So....who else ig going to see MJ??   
I got tickets for Jan 2009. Quite looking forward to it.       
			
			Now now, enough of the fighting. Can we not get back On Topic?   
Lets face it, MJ is a little bit crap, really. Isn't he?   
Except Rocket Robin, I quite liked that.
		    Nope I disagree, I quite like him. But each to their own.
		 
			
			OK OK I'm sorry Brightonite for calling you a tosser & to forum members sorry if I caused any offence with my way of communicating....   
I'm not particularly an MJ fan and I'm defintely not uptight, I have been sitting here laughing at most of this, really. Except the part where Rabina tried to make parallels to the OJ case with MJ's, both black, both rich, get me?   
I often get misunderstood but I suppose it is my own fault as I like writing on forums but cannot get my own cockney drawl out of my head when I am doing so, I have tried to write 'normally' but it's exhausting especially when I'm on a subject like this....I have been in trouble many a time because of this but again, I should not expect to be understood in that way darlin(g)'s so profound sorryness   
If anyone knows anyone who coaches forum writing on the lines of 'think like a forum writer when you write on a forum' I would be most happy   
			
			I didn't create a parallel because of their color, I was simply pointing out the fact that accused rich American celebrities in the public domain can't be seen to be suffering the full weight of their rather feudal penal system. And no, I haven't bought any MJ tickets, because it's just not my style of music. Not enough long hair and guitar riffs....
		    This is all Off Topic and nothing to do with MJ. However, I have thought for a while before responding to your apology and even if I should have done so. I have a tendency to be condescending and even when I am not being so, I can still come across that way. I and others have obviously upset you, because of the way that you responded. Thanks for the apology, transistion. Though, I am not the sort of person that takes offence, by being called names and being called a tosser doesnt worry me at all. Had it upset me, Id have merely added another red blob to your reputation and as you can see. I havent. 
You will find things easier for yourself on EF, (and throughout life) if you accept that everyone has opinions and of course people will make comparisons between OJ and MJ. The key is, never to take it personally. Two of my heroes, are Lance Armstrong and Lewis Hamilton, I have been part of threads, here on EF, where they have both, been vehemently attacked, by other posters. Its just another persons opinion and Live and let live I may put my point of view across, but I will never get personal and use name calling as my response, if I did, it would show that I had lost the argument. Sarcasm is much more effective, it may be the lowest form of wit, but it is still wit and it will make you some friends as well as enemies. Name calling, only makes enemies. When I was younger, Id often get to a point in an argument with my wife, where I became abusive and would swear at her, it was at this point that Id lost the argument. Later when things calmed down, I would apologise. Im a bit wiser now 
You ask for coaching for writing on forums. Well it doesnt really exist, but hopefully I have given you some pointers above. As far as I know there are no cliques on EF, we, like you, are all individuals. I have never met another member in the flesh, (though Id like to  ) on one day someone will agree with me and then disagree the next. Just be yourself, take time to write stuff and remember some of the above, if you wish to.   
See, it has come across condescending. It's not meant to be.       They are all bald now.    
			
			I see in the paper this morning that Michael wants to adopt again.   
Is he in competition with Madonna?? 
Will he have the time in between concerts?? 
Hopefully, he won't dangle this one over the balcony......   
			
			Probably just stocking up for his spare parts inventory as it may run low during the long tour.
		 
			
			Does anyone have any spare tickets (x2) at a reasonable price for sale and not the ridiculous prices they are going for on ebay?
		    Huh? With an Avi like that it's hard to answer any question.    
			
			hahaha!!!! lol        
... and I'm looking for 2 tickets!  
hahaha
		    Couldn't possibly comment...
		    Whatever his personality he was a very good artist...I am really sad, now that he died I find some of the above posts simply awful    
			
			I think the best that one can do is to keep those memorable tickets as a sign of commemorating Jako being all times artist.
		 
			
			I wonder if everyone will get their cash back?   
Edit: answering my own question    
Some people who paid a fortune on eBay are going to be seriously p'eed off!       
			
			I'm still in shock! I think the stress of the tour may have been a factor/cause of his death. Many people in the UK are saying it's a similar feeling to when Elvis died. He's an iconic figure with the most amazing talent in singing, dancing, writing. His music will certainly live on. It's just sad that he never got to do his 'last curtain call'    
			
			Apparently, Elvis did his ""last curtain call"" on the toilet........ 
Stardom is just so glamourous.
		 
			
			See MJ never lies. It really was it :-)
		    I remember thinking something like ""Thank God"" when I found out that ""The King"" was dead.        At least Jim Morrison died in the bath. In Paris.
		 
			
			How much did Flow know?     
			
			I think that it is really sad that MJ is dead, because, at least in my world, he was living in relative obscurity. Now, I cannot turn on the radio or TV without being exposed to the little twerp. No doubt, those of us (The vast majority) will have to tolerate Dead Whacko Mania, for months to come. R.I.P. and go away quietly. Please!

			I don't really like the new CD. It's sort of the same stuff. Systematic Chaos was a lot better I thought.   
But the concert will be awesome for sure. I'm seeing them in Toronto on 14 August!
		    In Gelsenkirchen, Germany (last night) Neal Morse opened with: 
The Creation 
Leviathan

I'm a bit shocked that they almost didn't play anything from the new album.    
BTW, I'm planning to take the train from eastern Switzerland, and I would REALLY appreciate a ride back to Zurich if anyone's heading that way afterwards.     
			
			Just PM'd you Caleb.
		 
			
			Thnx, Rabina.  Beer's on me Saturday    
			
			Dude! Rivella Green works just fine for me...
		    Portnoy makes a different setlist for each show, so the set list won't be the same.   
Where's everyone standing tonight? I wouldn't mind meeting some fellow fany. I've never been to the Wettingen place though, so I don't really know where it would be anyway.
		 
			
			Bozo,  Rabina and I hoped to find you there, but we didn't see any deathmachine walking around.     
Regarding the concert itself, I liked the playlist a lot and, surprisingly, it was very similar to that they played in Germany:   
In the presence of Enemies 
Beyond this life 
Misunderstood 
A rite of passage 
Hollow Years 
Erotomania 
Voices 
Solitary Shell (a long, jammed, fantastic version) 
The Spirit carries on

			Cool gig - started at 20:15, over at 22:00, what's with the early times? Strange venue, very similar to the Eulachhalle in Winterthur (lousy acoustics in a concrete sports hall).    
Favorite bit was the Rudess/Petrucci solo stint during the encore. These guys know their stuff - excellent!
		    Next time we will definitely have to meet. I was in a great spot for Cynic. Then afterward, I had to take a leak, and when I tried to get back to my original spot people were being dicks and wouldn't let me through. And with no one there ""reserving"" it for me and the inability to articulately argue I was already there, I just stood further back. Oh well, I'm tall.   
I heard a couple of english speakers on the way out. You two weren't talking about fire safety on the way out of the show, were you?       I liked the playlist too. I was hoping for some stuff from the new album, but I was sated. The encore song was great, 2 of my favorites.   
I'm hoping next time through they go with the ""An Evening with..."" format so they play 2 sets.
		    Yes we were. I had mentioned what a crush it was on the way out. Hey, there's always Porcupine Tree to look forward to in Wettingen this fall.
		       Damn...that's embarrasing.  We were.

			Hi there,   
is anybody going to the BB King concert at the Montreux Jazz Festival on 12. July? I find it almost impossible to get a reasonable priced hotel room. Is anybody driving to Zurich or Solothurn that night and could give 2 ppl a ride? I hope I am not running into a psychopath killer here....   
Best, 
Michele
		   Have you looked for a room in Vevey or Villeneuve ? There’s a free bus service that runs to these town from the concerts. You could also look at the festival website to see if there are any special trains to Zurich.    
			
			On the Jazz website under Practical/Transport, at the bottom of the page are two links to car sharing sites.
		 
			
			Thanks, that wasn't there yet, when I looked last time.
		 
			
			Hi Michelle,   
Just spent a week around this area. It's very easy to get around on bikes (you can hire in this area) or trains so I'd go with Blonaybear's recommendation.    
After a quick look on the web, I found this place for 60 bucks per person per night, right in Montreux.       
Have a great time at the concert (envy).   
Harry
		 
			
			There are 2 of us driving from Zurich...we're heading out there Saturday and spending Saturday and Sunday night in Lausanne. Rooms were a lot cheaper there and it's less than 30 minutes away by train.

			This was actually a really good show and not at all the schlockfest I feared it might be. Added bonus: the Volkshaus only made me pay 40 francs for my ticket because I was a tiny bit late. Thanks for posting, Rabina!   
shame they didn't play this though  :       
			
			Thanks for the post. It really was a feel good concert. The new guy - Arnel Pineda, was the difference. His boundless energy and obvious love for the songs kept the evening rocking along. Quite a few new tracks from the ""Revelation"" CD went down very well, even though Journey get next to zero airtime in Switzerland.
		 
			
			I was there last night....great show...loved the small venue! 
It was the first time, though, that I'd been to a rock concert where people actually stayed sitting (at least upstairs) the whole time. 
The new lead singer was awesome! So much energy!

			Wow service sounds good, but the price you pay is , i don`t think the young ones will pay those prices   
			
			Yeah, the problem is you don't have a choice to bring your own anymore as they've banned entry with bottles or cans    
Seems Feldschlossheinekberg is all on offer.   
Also, apparently drugs are illegal too. Fancy.
		    9l Water = 48.-  = 5.33 per liter 
12l Beer = 60.- = 5.00 per liter   
It always astounds me how they can sell beer for less than plain water.
		    Actually, for Bars and Restaurants it's not allowed to have alcohol that is more inexpensive than the cheapest non-alcoholic drink.... I guess the same would apply here.   
What a rip-off though... good that there is such a long fence and little river. More than enough places to get your own booze in...

			I'm not sure if there are any Canadian independent music fans here, but Holy F*$% (they caught a lot of flack from the CDN government for their name) is playing May 1st in Rorschach. I would classify the music as electronic but without computers, samplers as all of the music is played live with keyboards and guitar pedals. Definitely one of the best live shows I've ever been too and I will definitely be going to this one.   
Here's some examples of their stuff (check out Lovely Allen) from their myspace page:     
I'm rather new in Switzerland (Zurich) and interested in meeting new people so if the music appeals to anyone and folks are interested in coming along PM me.

			Sadly the link is blocked by the swear filter, but for those who were interested it starts with F.   
Apparently there's a pretty good support act from Kent as well but I totally forgot their name :S   
I know of a few who are interested in going, and maybe staying over to see a bit of Rorschach on the Saturday, no firm plans made for it yet but might see you there.
		 
			
			I think the opening band is It Hugs Back. I've not heard much about them. If you firm up plans later in the week, let me know, I'm sure a Saturday in Rorschach would be nice.
		 
			
			Just wanted to see if there was any last minute interest. I also found some additional info:   
Tickets are 16 CHF (possible to reserve up to 17:00 day of concert). Doors open at 20:00, concert starts at 21:30. 
Return ticket to Rorschach from Zürich is 36 CHF (with a halbtax). 
Possibility to come back after concert (trains at 00:39 and 2:11) or to stay over in Rorschach in a new hostel on the lake ( ).   
It's going to be a great show!!!

Ok, so Wham were crap but they certainly captured the 80s Zeitgeist.   
One of my favourites was ""Nothing looks the same in the Light"". 
It was not a hit as I remember, only an album track, but I think it showed early promise of George Michael's song-writing skills.   
"" I watch you breathe, I cannot sleep, 
I touch your hair, I kiss your skin, 
And hope the morning sun won't wake you too soon. 
For when you wake and look at me, you never know you just might see 
Another boy who crept into your room... 
Take your time (that's what you told me)....take your time 
But I fell head first and I just don't know what to do.   
Nothing looks the same in the light; 
Only a fool like me could take to heart, 
The things you said you meant last night.....""   
Oh...so soft and romantic....     
(Sorry for all whose stomachs have just churned)
		    How dare you sir!       
			
			Oops!!      
I liked them a lot more than Michael Jackson, though!!!
		 
			
			Sorry J. L_P I had to groan at you. I was desperately in love with Andrew Ridgley. By the way, does anyone know where he is and what he does at the moment. I think that the only way to get him out of my mind is to look at a recent picture of his.
		    Definitely the correct use of a groan.       your way to Andrew... or take a look at     
Do I get my ""thanks"" now?    
			
			Thanks a lot but I am heartbroken!. He is married with one of the Bananarama!!
		    Hi Cinzia.   
You can find out what happened to Andrew Ridgeley (and other stars from yesteryear) at the  ""   "" website. 
. 
.. 
...   
HTH
		    At least you fancied the straight one.....      This did not improve my chances.   
By the way I saw a video on line. He is bold!!!
		 
			
			Time for a confession folks. I'm a straight male, find women (not all) attractive and have created my own diaper-filling small person, but I liked Frankie Goes to Hollywood at the time (circa 1984), especially Two Tribes and Welcome To The Pleasuredome. I would go to a concert if they played some old stuff, with extended (sic!) remixes. Liverpudlians, feel free to heckle me (alright, calm down, calm down, eh, eh....)
		    Hate to tell you Louis Wu - more like 25 years ago. I saw Ultravox on Easter Saturday at the Armadillo in Glasgow...so much better than I thought they'd be. Midge, Chris, Billy and Warren did an outstanding turn, and even Mr Ure asked where we had all been for 25 years! Scary thing is that they were the first live band I had ever seen (Glasgow Apollo) so the years suddenly caught up with me but I am happy to say we didn't stand still - a lot of dancing.

			Last minute discovery, information scarce and chancing it to Luzern- Anyone?    
			
			Welcome to the forum.   
Who or what is Al Jarreau? Some background info might be useful. Come along to the Pickwick Pub in Luzern anyway this evening to celebrate St George's day with Bob's real ale and some proper English cheese
		 
			
			Al Jarreau is a jazz/soul singer.
		 
			
			Hi Grumpy n all .. 
Hmmm if one has to ask who this Jazz vocalist genius is, then one probably wouldn't appreciate his music   - but then that doesnt sound possible so here's Take Five     
...and a summary from wikipedia      
St George's day? today? really? I forgot  Patriotism for u! 
Thanks - will definitely try to drop in! All for cheese too!

			Bumping this thread from the Social Calendar for those looking for live music in Zurich tonight.   
In case you don't know, there are actually three calendars (see menu bar). You can select which one you want from the bottom right options pane on the calendar itself.   
It's kinda confusing not to have all three calendars integrated in one, but I guess our Mods are doing what they can    
Go and see the Notwist, one of Germany's coolest bands of the last ten years or so. Some pretty cool Forum members who are attending are worth seeing, too, except some are more pretty than others    
			
			i heard that flow23 might have a spare ticket.
		 
			
			...and even if you're unsure about the music, go along for dinner with the others beforehand; the food is really rather good, the company more so. You'll be swept along on a tide of good-will and have a pleasant night out.   
Or you could stay at home and watch ITV3 or something...        
you're the one for me, fatty   "	4		 Jun 0001	[]	The Notwist | 01.01.1970	guest		1053	Concerts

			Squarepusher, wow, that's exciting..
		 
			
			Plus many, many others,            Puppetmastaz are even more exciting: once you've seen Yoda rhyming with ALF you can save yourself several CHF on LSD   Truly weird hiphop...
		 
			
			Is Squarepusher worth seeing? I've only listened to a few songs, but have heard good things about him. Plus, he's literally playing a minute away from my place. What would the vibe be like at his concert? Everyone dancing, tripping out of their minds, or more just enjoying the music? I've avoided the Electron festival these past years because I'm not really into electro, just more of a normal clubbing person. So is Squarepusher different enough to be worth it, or will it be like a normal electro concert that if you're not into it, you're just not?
		 
			
			Not sure about squarepusher myself, I always found his stuff a little inaccessible, maybe I haven't heard the right stuff, but I never really thought of it as being danceable.  Always willing to give it another go though.   
Although labelled electron festival, it's quite a diverse bunch of bands.  Metronomy are defintely more pop, Mr. Scruff has interesting jazz and funk, 2 Many DJs is very club, to name but a few.   
I hope I can make it, there's about 10+ bands/djs I want to see.
		 
			
			I wish we could go see Squarepusher tomorrow, he is definitely worth seeing. It is not the usual let's party music, that's fo sho, you might get tired of the work one does listening to him  ..It is not stuff to chill to, but I enjoy the intricacies and weirdness. If you want to hang with some interesting people and want to meet some not so usual crowd, go see him. He plays fretless bass or custombuilt 6string, whoa. It is definitely something else to listen to him online on some not so good speakers and see him live at a good sound place.

They're going to announce the official program and start selling tickets tomorrow, April 2 at noon!         
Jazz, what jazz?  Hardly any jazz in this ""Festival"".       If you subscribe to their newsletter you can get the details at 11.30
		    Isn't Van Halen jazz then?     
Apparently they are playing the festival on 4th July.
		 
			
			Yeah, people are always confused when I tell them that they should go to the Jazz Festival.   
If you haven't ever gone to the free workshops, I highly recommend them.  My favorite was B.B. King discussing his life and playing some blues...all for free.  A truly memorable experience!  The workshops are usually listed in the program and feature up close and personal opportunities with some of the big name stars, but not many people seem to know about them.
		 
			
			Here it is, looks legit:       
			
			Phew, nothing to tempt me there. Anything I'm interested in on the line-up I've already seen.
		 
			
			The Klaxons and Lily Allen could be interesting, but 85 francs for standing tickets is ridiculous. Last year, I paid 90 euros for a 3 day ticket at Eurockennes. Just as an example, in   out of 3 nights I saw The Offpsring, Gnarls Barkley, and Moby. The value for money just isn't there at Montreux compared to other festivals.
		 
			
			Here is the official programme:
		     
And 200 CHF for seated!       Seriously. The f**kers are on drugs.
		    The worst is that the seated area at the front (Auditorium Stravinsky) seems to be populated with an older, suite & tied, season ticket, there for the night out crowd. With the rear standing area full of the real fans of the act.   
I saw a Tori Amos & Wilco double bill there a couple of years ago. To quote Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, ""Thanks to you guys at the back!"", looks down at the faces in front him ""We like you too........ we just umm, like them more.""
		 
			
			Shocking lineup. If it was on on my back garden I'd go out.   
Hoping that Paleo in Nyon will be better. Lineup revealed next week.
		 
			
			I agree that the tickets are ridiculously expensive, but in defense of the Montreux Jazz Festival, I have to say that there are some great free concerts/workshops and that the atmosphere along the lake is priceless!   
As previously mentioned, one of my best experiences was seeing B.B. King's workshop for free.  The only problem is that Switzerland and the Blues don't really go together.  I saw B.B. in the middle of the day, with bright sunshine pouring into the room, which is not quite the same as seeing him perform in his club on Beale Street.
		 
			
			Hi all. Finally got our first tickets to the festival - after almost 6 years in Geneva. Does anyone know about the trains? Would like to take a train from Geneva to Montreux for this Saturday night 4 July concert. The Dave Matthews Band - our first concert in decades! Do the trains run at night returning to Geneva? I would think staying over would be difficult as all the places would be full. Thanks. Billy      It's incredibly difficult to look up on the CFF website as they only speak German, French, Italian and English, but i think you may be lucky, there is a train that leaves Montreux at 23hrs, 57 minutes and 25 seconds....     
please don't be so idle
		 
			
			Billy,   
I wouldn't plan on taking the train back to Geneva.  I'm assuming that DMB is the headliner and the headliners usually start playing around midnight.  If you want to relax and see the entire show, you would be better off driving.  Parking, while somewhat difficult to find, is free on the street.  The buses are also free, so even if you don't get a spot in Montreux, you'll be able to take a bus back to your car.  You should come early and enjoy the day.    
Montreux doesn't sleep during the Jazz Festival, so you can spend the night listening to music and go home when the sun comes up over the mountains in the morning.    
Insider's tip:  If you want to get from one venue to another relatively fast, walk on the sidewalk next to the road and not the promenade next to the lake, which will be packed with people moving at a snail's pace.
		 
			
			Thanks to  Charlie R. Soles for his prompt and thoughtful reply of dealing with transport to Montreux. Despite being here many years, we have never managed to get to this world-wide event. Bit surprised to hear that off street parking is free - they are not that kind here in Geneva.    Well all the best and kind regards Charlie, once again! Billy         As long as you move your car before 5:00 am, you'll be fine. After that they start towing the cars. I just checked and there is a train going back to Geneva at 1:08 am, which may not be a bad option. More info about transport  .
		    According to the program, Chickenfoot is the midnight special. We're also going to the concert, but we're staying in Montreux since Luzern is too far to travel. Very expensive evening, but should be fun.   
This will be our second time seeing Joe Satriani in concert in Switzerland, last time in Genf. What does he have against the German-speaking part of Switzerland?

Do you if you can buy cheaper/last minute tickets on the night?

			I little more info would be helpful, where are they playing and when?
		     
			
			None of them looks like any of the original Buena Vista Social Club guys. OK, I know a few of them have passed on since. Loved those cool old guys.    
			
			Honestly, you'll be gambling on how popular they are here, the KKL usually have tickets left on the door, but it's not unusual for them to sell out too.   
The fact that they're playing the KKL would indicate they expect a sizeable crowd.
		    No the original ones have all died.
		 
			
			Don't recognize the names or faces of this new line-up. Many of the originals have passed on but not all. Maybe their spirit lives on but...
		    I thought they'd all died too, but you can recognize the double bassist from the film on the right, the trumpetist whose in the Madison Square concert on the left & the guy next to the double bassist was in the film too. Not that it matters that much, I'm sure it'll be a brilliant concert.
