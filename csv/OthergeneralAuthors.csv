			For future reference....   
Germany Customs Officials have a special phone number in English.    
Tel.: +49 351 44834-530 
E-mail:  
Fax: +49 351 44834-590 
Monday to Friday  
from 08:00 to 17:00   
I called them and they said that since I'm Resident of CH and CH isn't in the EU, I am allowed temporary admissions duty free to travel to CH on everything I bought in the US except consumables such as liquor and cigarettes (although that might make for a great train ride to CH  . I don't have to fill out the paper work and I can just verbally tell them in the green lane that I'm passing through and not resident. Helps to show my train ticket and CH resident permit.    
Here's more info in English on Germany / EU customs.        
The DE customs telephone help agent was quite friendly and helpful. In fact, Thats the most cheerful supportive customs personnel that I've ever come across. I think it'd be great if we were we welcomed back by such cheery agents each time we returned.  Perhaps even banners saying how much the country missed us while we were gone. 😃   
Hope this helps the next person needing this info.

			Yes. As you are importing something.    
Normal import tax of 8% of total shipping value (price of item + cost of delivery) plus a handling fee depending on courier used.  
No duty for sure as long as you import less than 5 watches.

			""...why would you leave your grill a mess?""   
You certainly shouldn't, you're right. But there's a difference between leaving leftovers/gunk on, and maintaining a fired-on seasoning. Stripping it right back to the grill grate every time and reapplying some oil isn't the way to go. Google it - you'll find that just about every authority on barbecuing,  grilling and cast-iron cooking recommends maintaining a seasoning.   
That said, you should clean the inside casing/periphery of your grill thoroughly - maybe I wasn't as clear as I could have been in my first post.

			Also to note, every building and housing area can different.     
For example my last apartment did not have a designated communal disposal area.  We just had to bring down our waste on the morning of the pick up and set it by the road.   
My apartment now has a designated communal disposal area with green bins, trash bins, and recycling.   
If you are unsure how it works in your building, ask a neighbor, your Hauswart, or call your landlord.

If there are no specific restrictions in place due to fire risk ( which there aren't at the moment) then they are allowed. 
 It depends on the category of firework and when they are to be used ( and possibly also the individual communes) as to whether permission needs to be obtained beforehand by private individuals. Organised displays need permission and are subject to additional security measures.

			As far as I am aware, if you are being made redundant then your employer must allow you time off during work time to attend interviews. If you choose to search for a new job of your own accord, then your employer doesn't have to give you time off (at their expense) to attend an interview, why would they  
It's not unreasonable of them to ask you to use leave or take the time unpaid (whether you are normally working at home or in the office).

On this issue, you could determine the integrity of your financial advisor by setting a trap, a sort of honeypot.    
Financial Advisors get a huge commission for inveigling their clients into buying  an  insurance company 3rd Pillar (3. Saüle) product. These are long term commitments, very expensive to get out of, and are in 99.9% of case unsuitable for the clients. The alternative bank issued 3rd Pillar products have (normally) no such long term obligation and you can stop paying into these without penalty if the need arises, your circumstances change, lose job etc. etc. However, there is no money to be made for financial advisors in recommending these.   
This is completely separate from the argument about whether, in general, 3rd pillar products, with their significant (initial) tax savings are a good idea. That discussion rages here from time to time.   
Now we are coming up to the year end, the time when it is soon too late to do something for 2016. Casually ask the advisor about 3rd Pillar products and see what happens.

			Yeah, it is closer to 30 CHFs. I have shipped skis several times within Switzerland. I normally either put them in an old ski box or make one out of cardboard.    
I haven't shipped with boots but if the package meets the sperrgut requirements, you should be able to ship together. Ask at the post office about your other questions. They are open most days.

			I wouldn't advise the 3rd route Michelin suggests via Vallorbe.  It's always busy both directions on a Friday evening.  We come back from our UK trips on a Friday and hit Pontaliar around 5pm and then it is slow going to get out of the city towards Vallorbe, but even worse coming from there.  Nose to tail usually creeping along.  Not usually a queue at the border itself, but the run into Pontarliar gets gummed up with traffic.   
As dodgyken says, try and leave a bit later if you can.  So long as you let your hotel know you'll be checking in after 6pm it shouldn't be a problem.

			Thanks for the info all. Looking at the images online i think the telescopes do seem to show more.. I don't want to go too pro as its too expensive for now, but would like a decent image of some rings on Saturn. So maybe up to 200fr I am hoping. Not sure on the quality of toy store telescopes though..? Do you think a 70mm would be any good? It is for me and my daughter. We had a telescope in my childhood home and my daughter has been asking to get one for the last year or two. So i thought we would venture the hobby together. Complete beginners, I'm not even sure of the specs of the telescope we had back home. Its long gone now.. 
Thanks, will also check out the android app! Went ahead and ordered some books too.  
We do have a lot of light pollution close to Basel but can easily go up to Gempen.

If you have strong reason to assume that the other guy is who he claims to be, for instance because previous arrangements were honored, or that the same address you used is used on his business web site, I would think that e-mails to and from the same address can be used as evidence.    
After all, contracts need not be in written form in order to be binding, neither do they require a signature. What is needed is the clear consent by both/all parties. For instance if someone picks up some item at a retailer and walks out with it this concludes a contract to buy said item - which makes him/her a thief if s/he walks out without paying.

I have an old Bernia the metal one and I love it. Last week I was in the fleah market in Zürich and one person was selling a Bernia for 80 sfr. so have a look around in the fleah markets in your area, you might get lucky. 
But go for bernina.  
good luck

Whether you need a permit is likely down to your Gemeinde regs, though.    
From my experience:   
Replacing an existing chimney can be done without permits if you are replacing like for more or less like (we did that - replaced the exisiting fireplace, cost ca. 10K all in), installing something new could be a whole 'nuther can o' permit worms. But of course, YMMV.   
Good luck with the project.

			I can also recommend the Sonicare.    
I used to have a normal electric one, might have been an Oral B, can't remember, but never quite got used to it. I also struggled with the Sonicare in the beginning - since you don't need to apply any pressure really, it just takes some getting used to and changes in habit in how you brush your teeth. I use it in the evenings now, usually with two different modes. It's boring, but you get used to it. I just watch TV in the meantime. In the morning, I normally use a manual one as I brush my teeth while showering (  ), though I have started to use the Sonicare in the mornings as well at times (not while in the shower  )   
I've never had a massive issue with my teeth really (never had a cavity and 1x teeth cleaning a year is enough), but struggled with the gums, even if slightly, cause I tended to use too much pressure with the manual brush, even when I only took the softest brush available. No real bleeding, but just sensitive at times. That seems to have improved quite a bit and I also find the Sonicare makes the teeth somewhat cleaner and definitely much smoother. I wouldn't want to miss it anymore.

			Just in case there is still any confusion about which colour of electrical wire is used for which purpose, this extract from (Ger: )   should clear the matter up:   
Google translated into near English:   
Lead colors 
Depending on the year of construction and the origin of cables and plugs, a large wild growth of colors is to be found; As a result of EU standards, there were once again changes. Poles (under voltage) today are usually brown, partly black or gray, formerly also white, red and black. The neutralliter is indicated by the blue color (formerly yellow), the protective conductor or the earthing is yellow-green (formerly yellow-red). Caution: Even if a lamp is lit, the wires are not always connected correctly - in case of doubt, have them checked.

I think the ""percentile"" is actually a very good indicator, thanks for remembering about this. In Australia we were in high medium but simply because we had 2 incomes above average by abot 30%. My missus is in finance management and I'm in engineering.   
Now in Sweden I'd say I make about 30-50% above AVERAGE Swedish salary (not in my field but overall). Coupled with my missus not working due to various reasons, I'd say we're in middle bracket. Basically, we can afford nice, semi-new apartment, cover the bills, 1 car, don't have to count the cost of groseries or simple occasional clothing items. Anything above that (big ticket clothing, travel going out, entertainment) we have to ration pretty hard.   
If and when we move to CH, missus probably won't be working for a while. She doesn't speak German and I don't place high hopes for english-speaking job opportunities. So what I'm trying to do now is understand what kind of salary I should accept in order to at least maintain or improve the budget situation.

			I just noticed that, but on their information page they still say the customer is liable for duties and taxes. Maybe it just hasn't caught up yet -have you ordered something and not been charged duties?    
Just a note as far as I can see, they don't remove the UK VAT (20%), so are still charging more to Switzerland as our duty is 12%. Still, it's an improvement to paying VAT in both countries like we did before and like M&S's new Swiss site! Sorry, I am a real nerd about this since coming to Switzerland...

I sadly lost a long loved Banana plant due to the root system rotting away in too much water, since it didn't have draining holes, the soil was super-saturated at the bottom, but could be bone dry at the top.

The Sozialzentrum Höfe and the Seelsorgeraum Berg in Wollerau are collecting winter clothing in good condition. There is most need for children's clothing, but donations of adult clothing are welcome too.   
Donated clothing can be dropped off on 29. November, from 10 – 18:00 at the Pfarreisaal, Hauptstr. 28, Wollerau.   
See here, scroll down about half way:     
According to an article in the local newspaper, they are also looking for volunteers to help staff the collection on the 29th as well as the distribution on the 30th.

			The costs will depend on the items and the website you buy from. 
Generally below 60chf there is no tax, anything above that will incur some form of Swiss customs tax. 
A lot of websites include this delta in the price whereas others don't and you have to pay the costs on collection at the post office. 
I've ordered from UK, USA, Germany and France and all had varying solutions depending on the company and what they cover.

I have found this site incredibly helpful and everyone so friendly that I hope someone in the Basel area might be able to help me again now! I am looking for a space to run drama/performance workshops in Basel. I am currently based in the UK and I come to Basel every month (I'm moving in 2017) I want to contact some spaces and arrange viewings maybe, for the next time I'm in town in November - but not sure where to start and could do with some insider info    Anyone got any info/ideas for me to give me a head start? Any ideas about space that is hire-able either informally or commercially would be great info and a place for me to start.   
Many thanks folks!

			Yes I meant people with private health insurance, who pay on top of or indepent of whatever national scheme their government has. For people from Germany and Netherlands for example this insurance would be about 35-40% of the Swiss cost.   
I assume it is only for new arrivals, as you have to do it within the three months although if you are energetic you can always go to the kanton with the EU card and ask (say just before the end of your yearly Swiss insurance is renewed). But don't call, you are not likely go get far on the phone I think.

			If it's clearly by the road, trash bins, or it's around garbage day, with no 'gratis' sign or garbage sticker we'd take it    
If you're not sure, and it's close to someone's home or in their driveway, we'd ask about it.    
Sometimes the gratis and for sale signs do fall off or get blown away.

			Having been through the same thing as you, i understand what you are saying.   
I got out after 8 years of abuse. Physical and mental. He was going to kill me.  It takes time to heal, but we can do it.  With the support of family and friends.   
I'm so happy that you are in a good place now.  It takes time, but just shows that we can get there.  Even if we don't think we can at the time.   
Sometimes, you will have flashbacks.  But over time those will fade. Nowadays i just think of him as a sad person.  And it's been 16 years ago.  And he's dead, so he can't hurt me anymore.   
Good luck.  Life is precious.   
One thing - if you start a new relationship.  Don't think every man is like him and is going to hurt you.  There are some nice guys out there!!  Cuddly people!!

			It's a box of papers, 5kg, if they are really that important you can't scan and send them, they really want the originals, send by post of UPS/DHL, it's not that expensive at the end of the day and you are sure to get your papers.   
A cargo forwarder is really not going to bother with 5kg of paper, he get a DHL quote, add 50% to it and quote you accordingly.

			My Step mom and her 2 sisters are coming to visit us, and are thinking of taking a river cruise down the Rhine ending in Basel.   
Looking at a May 2017-  8 Day River Cruise from Amsterdam to Basel   
I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for or against a particular company, or any caveats.    
In the US, Viking has been advertising heavily, with Scenic following suit.    
Avalon Waterways just hit the market and is offering some attractive discounts that they may want to pursue.       
Day 1 Amsterdam (Embarkation): welcome reception   
Day 2 Amsterdam: canal cruise   
Day 3 Cologne: choice of guided city walk or Jewish Heritage walk   
Day 4 KoblenzRhine GorgeRüdesheim:  guided sightseeing in Koblenz; cruise through the Rhine Gorge; visit  Siegfrieds Mechanical Musical Instrument Museum in Rüdesheim; special  treat   
Day 5 Mainz. Excursion to Heidelberg: guided walk, visit the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz; excursion to Heidelberg; guided visit of the castle, see the Great Vat   
Day 6 Strasbourg: guided sightseeing, visit the La Petite France district and the gothic cathedral; onboard woodcarving demonstration   
Day 7 Breisach. Excursion to the Black Forest: visit a local woodcarvers workshop or visit a Black Forest open-air museum   
Day 8 Basel (Disembarkation):     
Thanks in advance.

According to the below this is still a valid option.

			@Tom1234   
Have you looked at   with whichever ME airline that goes to the location you need? Preferably on a non-stop flight. Normally air freight costing is based on weight and cube so if the thing(s) is not huge, it might make more sense.    
It would imply dropping it off at the carrier's depot and having it picked up at the other end. Possible? Delivery would be faster as well.

			I forgot to mention earlier but it is Rhyner's Oktoberfest this weekend - with an extra 10% off everything.   
I picked up a Metabo 18LTX with 2*4A batteries for almost half price - if I could all the free stuff I got on top then it was half price.   
About as much of a cordless drill you'd ever need - and totally over the top for DIY work - but boys need their toys!

Are there any non-touristy things or local staples we should go look for? Are there any day trips from Zurich we should make even in November?

			Permanent residents pay income tax whereas holiday guests don't, yet both use a commune's infrastructure. To compensate for that, holiday apartments' rent get a ""Kurtaxe"" (around 2CHF per day usually) added upon them for each night they're let.    
However, holiday apartments that aren't offered for rent don't earn Kurtaxe. Probably those assumed 50 days with 2.50 each are simply a compensation for this.   
No idea whether that's legal but it would certainly make sense.

			Please note - following situation can indicate that the seller is a potential fraud :    
- The seller is requesting to contact them on a private email instead of communicating through Amazon. The only proper way you should contact seller before placing an order is the following :    
1. Click on the seller's nick name 
2. On the next page  at the bottom of the page on the right side under Weitere Informationen you will find a link "" Verkäufer kontaktieren"", which will bring you to our contact form. 
3. Please choose a subject from ""Wählen Sie einen Betreff "", type your message into the text field and send the message by clicking on ""E-Mail abschicken   
That way, the conversation will be noted in our system, and if by any chance any issue occurs, we will be able to see everything seller wrote to you.   
- The seller is asking you to pay for the order on an external account using wire transfer or any other type of payment. For all orders placed on Amazon, regardless if the item is sold by a third party seller, or by Amazon itself, payment has to go trough our system. Meaning that the process of placing the order is the same for all items, and your payment is secured this way. Any request from the seller which asks of you to do something that is not in the standard process of ordering is considered as a possible fraud.    
- If a seller is offering a significantly lower price for an item which is normally a lot more expensive. In this situation I would advise to contact the seller before actually placing the order, just to make sure everything is okay   
In addition, I would advise you to always check the seller's page on Amazon.de for reviews from other customers, since they are usually a good indicator of the sellers business.   
I regret any inconveniences caused and I thank you for your understanding.   
For any further issues or queries, do not hesitate to contact us. We will be more than happy to assist you.   
You can reach us via the e-mail contact form on our Help pages:       
I wish you a lovely evening!

Are there many watch collectors on the forum? I recently bought my first Swiss watch, a Louis Erard 1931 automatic - made in Le Noirmont in Jura. I hadn't heard of the brand before but I love the watch and it seems high quality (and from what I heard & read).   
It's this exact model:    
I was wondering if anyone else has an opinion on these watches and anybody keen to show their collections or personal favourites?

			Green Celery, 
My comment was not on the rules but how they are applied. Of course the US agreed to the ICAO recommended practice for transit of duty free liquids (the bags I mentioned).   
However reality is that most TSA agents, particularly those in domestic terminals, have never seen or heard of such a thing. I'd give it a 50-50 chance of getting bottles past their eagle eyes.    
Seeing as you have to take your suitcases through US customs anyway it's the perfect opportunity to put your bottles in them.

In my case it wasn't just that I was walking longer distances than I was used to, it was also the transition from flatland to 3 dimensional space. (My problem wasn't so much blisters but rather chronically tired feet.)    
Have you noticed how close the bus/tram stops are to each other? One reason for this is the basic fact that for a large part of any trip here in Switzerland you are either going uphill, or you are going downhill. It takes a while until you get used to this.   
You've only been here a week. Choose shoes that have a bit of heel (as opposed to ballet flats), and a supportive but padded upper (i.e. running shoes) Thin strap sandals with a hard sole may look great, but until you teach your ankles and knees to absorb the impact leave them out. If you are going an extended distance then discard vanity and wear sensible shoes. Bring your eyecatchers in a carry and swap when you get to a flat bit.   
IIRC I couldn't wear Timberlands for about the first couple of months.

			Hi guys: 
While I like using LAS Burg and Swiss Paket to receive packages, I would prefer to use the DHL Paketstations (these are automated machines that hold packages for you, sort of like a electronic locker). This means that I can come to pickup the packages whenever I want, without queuing, and for free.   
However, these Paketstations apparently require you to initially register online with a German address (and maybe a DE phone number).   
So, would it be possible to use LAS Burg as my ""German address"" when registering for the Paketstation service?   
Have any of you tried this?   
TIA

			Jumping to a different body part here, but our son had issue with his hearing during our first time in Switzerland. My German was close to non-existant, so we started a parallel course with his doctor in Norway, with referrals to specialists in Switzerland (from his Swiss paediatrician) and Norway.   
In the end, we opted for surgery in Switzerland. We felt we got better and more attentive care here, even though none of us spoke German (he went to French school) well. Even more importantly we worried about post-surgery follow-up if we went for the Norwegian option, especially if there we complications. There were also practical considerations; not sure about how it is with the NHS, but in Norway a planned surgery can be bumped if there is a more pressing case and flying there for nothing would have been a) expensive, b) very frustrating.   
No regrets here, but I completely understand the incertitude you're facing. It's definitely not comfortable to sit in a room with a doctor and smile politely while thinking ""she sure looks competent, but what did the nice lady really say???"".   
Fortunately a few nurses and several doctors at the Zürich Kinderspital speak ok to really good English. Perhaps there is something worth investigating in the earlier advice to go to a German speaking city for a second opinion.

			Helo everyone, I've been vermicomposting with a homemade worm bin for a couple of months. those commercial ones are just too expensive for me. My worm bin is doing well as long as I take care of my worms properly. I made it by following instructions from an article that I saw online. Just had some troubles at first when I transferred my worms to the bin. They try to escape! It takes a week or two before they get settled and realize that it's their new 'home'. If this happens to you in the first couple of weeks, it's completely normal. Just make sure to shine a light and open the bin slightly - this will make the worms want to go down in the dirt so they don't try to escape.   
Here's a couple of articles that are helpful       
Let me know how your bins go! If you have some questions, I would be more than glad to answer them   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Apr 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Worm Composting/Vermiculture - has anyone tried this?	ctan	Posts: 113

			Yay, great to read the replies and glad some people found the link useful.  I know a lot of companies deliver to Switzerland - often at great cost... wanted to order a couple of bits from Green Baby UK but they wanted £45 to deliver here! - but the key thing with the feelunique website for me was that the prices included delivery so you could place lots of small orders to avoid paying customs.  Cheapskate moi?    
Blindgirl - I also love Toast and have had deliveries here from them.  They deduct VAT which is great (surprisingly a lot of online companies DON'T).  White Company also deliver here and deduct VAT.  I'd be interested in other links/suggestions you might have if you fancy spilling the beans

			I'm a stay at home mom right now and when I move to Basel I hope to study or work sooner or later. Although I might be able to spend time with my toddler at home I would like her to be exposed to other children, especially now as it would be a new environment for her.    
I wouldn't need full time care for her though and wouldn't be able to afford it either. I am looking only at 3 hours/day, 3 days a week maximum. Thanks for your references, I have looked them up online and have also written to them with my queries.    
In the mean time if you come across anyone who knows smaller spaces to take my child to even just play groups, let me know.    
Thanks again

			I wouldn't suspect fraud, but as always keep your eyes open. Go with the person on a test drive or keep your gray card with you while they're driving with a copy.   
We had exporters interested in our car too, but they were offering peanuts. Since the sale wasn't urgent, and we knew the car was still in good shape, we held out and sold to a local guy for 90% of asking price. We used a sale template someone posted here on EF and the guy paid cash. Easy-peasy.

			Hi, I moved to Switzerland from Japan last year, and I have confronted the same problem as you. (still now) Especially, it was big suprise and I was disappointed that it's impossible to use amazon.     
My recommend:     
<Electric appliances, Furnitures +α> 
BRAKC   
Inter Discount   
Media Market   
comforma   
pfister   
I feel there a big difference about their service depending on the branch/sales person. Delivery sometimes takes 2 MONTHS! Also, sometimes very ""cheap""..(But pfister is too expensive for me.) 
IKEA           
<Supermarket> 
Coop   
Migros     
At Migros, I might be able to find only thier private lavel products depends on category. I reccomend Coop first. 
If you want to buy higher quality foods, better to go to Manor Foods. When I need muton, definately go to Manor.     
<Book> 
Book Depository       
In addition, they are very useful too. 
CASA   
Regarding your clothes, you can order at GAP online. (To return is a little difficult or nonsence for us living in Swizerland. Delivery cost is too high.)         
There are shops a lots which they don't delivery to Swizerland in Europa. 
You might feel uncomfortable, I think you will give up soon..(about everything)

Very often they will include the basic insurance whereas if you book directly with the rental company you have to pay extra.  Actually last time I booked through arguscarhire and it was 150 GBP ~ 220CHF for 7 days 'standard' size from AVIS.  I never take the extra insurances.

328	null	null	null	null	"    I think you misread what you quoted.   
I wrote that the 750D/760D was a better better bet than the 700D (and this is what you quoted before talking about the 70D).   
Yes, of course the 70D is a better camera with it's environmental sealing (you're still not going to change a lense in a downpour though, whatever you've got). 
It is more expensive though.   
But comparing the newer 750D/760D with the 700D, newer is better.  There is a newer, faster processor, the Digic 6 compared with the Digic 5.   
The improvements include shooting at 14fps compared with 10, better low light performance with reduced noise, faster AF and, if you so choose MEG4 video as well as H.264 
The built in wireless is good too as you can use your smart phone as a remote trigger and can control the focus etc from the smart phone too.   
So yes, the 70D is a better camera than those others but the 760D is better than it's predecessor, the 700D and, apart from the sealing, is almost comparable to the 70D as well as being lighter. (565g compared with 755g).   
I went with the lighter one and a plastic bag and a couple of rubber bands.

			Sorry, but yes iirc you are bound to a teaching/technical job, that is why you must have professional qualifications to be able to work here.   
""     
On admission, a request by the employer respecting the pay and conditions of employment customary in the locality and in the branch must be made. In addition, members of the family of a short stay permit holder (art. 26OASA) must have professional qualifications (personal qualifications, Art. 23 AuG).   
The possibility of gainful employment for family members is related, according to art. OASA 26 and 27, to the duration of the authorization of the person granted family reunification. If the residence permit of the spouse is not renewed, the members of his family cannot claim a right to pursue their gainful employment (art.6, para. 2, OASA).""

			I am writing on behalf of my friend Amy. She did not ask me to post this, but I feel powerless not being able to help, hence I am sharing her story here in the hopes someone can send her an encouraging note or some funds for treatment.    
Amy is an Australian woman with late stage Lyme disease. Since Australia does not recognize chronic Lyme disease and she is in agony every day, she came to Paracelsus Klinik Al Ronc earlier this year for treatment. Antibiotics did not work for her at her stage (she tried antibiotics at the BCL clinic Augsburg last year and they almost killed her with Herx reactions and anaphylactic shocks) so now she is trying herbal antimicrobials and she also needs IV pain killers and nutrients since regular seizures make it hard for her to eat/drink. She also had a surgery to remove lesions in Germany and will have more later this year.   
She is planning to return to Switzerland later this year. Her fundraising page is here   and she has a Facebook as well  . If anyone is interested in Lyme disease in its medical and political sphere, her Facebook is worth a read. She posts the latest research and debates.    
That's all, thanks for reading and thank you for supporting Amy if you can

			No VAT form (or at least, no commitment from the shop to honour an export stamped invoice), no tax refund.   
It's the shop which actually refunds the tax (or cuts a deal with eg Global Blue to do it), and they don't have to.

			No idea where you buy them in Switzerland, I am a big fan of Simple Human bins/ trash cans, UK prices from £60 to £160   
The foot pedal works, so you do not need to touch the bin, apart from when you are emptying it.  (I have not tried the sensor kind)   
They look elegant / smart as stand alone piece of furniture

			In theory,  anything you've bought less than 6 months prior to coming here is taxable and should be reported.    
There are sources for small electrics wired for abroad. I believe their businesses started to supply US armed forces personnel posted outside the US. Before we moved here in 2007, I bought a kitchen aid stand mixer, food processor and crock  pot. They are still working. The price was much less than Switzerland, and they must be delivered to a US address. So they went in our container. The only small inconvenience is that the items have a German plug, easily fixed with an adapter.    
This is who we used. Haven't checked back since we left, compare their prices and see. I think they are located in Houston, TX.

Good to see some movement here. I have a guitar and amp with me in Zug, but havent  alot of time to play at the minute. I hope to bring my acoustic back with me on my next trip home, and will be sure to meet up for a jam, if even just for the fun of it.

			Generally speaking check Impressum, AGB and About Us.   
sportScheck.ch is the swiss daughter of the german parent. You can expect them to send from within CH. 
kellersports.ch is a german company, may well ship from Germany 
campz.ch is the site of a german company but campz.ch sell/deliver to swiss customers exclusively. no customs issues to be expected imho      crossborder debt collection is a major PITA so don't expect such an offer from any foreign company

			Hello,   
there are a couple of tamil temples in Zurich, such as the one in Adliswil (Sihlweg 3, 8134 Adliswil,044 709 06 30)    
They speak understandable English and decent German. You could give them a call and ask. They should be able to help you make one or direct you to someone immediate who can.     
cheers and all the best

			Hi there!  
I have quite a few pieces of jewelry that were passed down to me by my mother, and I would like to sell a few pieces. I have NO idea of the items worth, so I do not want to pay a few hundred francs to get them appraised before hand.  
I am looking for a safe and reputable jeweller/company that I can sell the pieces to and receive payment at the end of the appointment. I am very very worried that I am going to be scammed.    
Any tips would be much appreciated   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2016	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Looking to sell antique jewelry	saghai	Posts: 1

Again, the scanning can make the process output beautiful and more controlled. And you can even chose what you want to keep and not.       Usually, it is Film - Develop - Scan. Some people (like me) like the feel that a BW film gives to the shot. The dynamic range is also quite useful. I am not even going to get started on printing (so much fun!). I also use digital btw.

There is however a fixed charge of CHF 5.00 for delivery. I worked out the math, it is worth If you are changing chf 500 and above. I am going to change CHF2000 soon and I can about 20 francs if I use postfinance.

			Hello, I am new to this forum, and I wonder t4ment if you ever resolved your question. Like you, i live in neighbouring france and after quite a few years as a UN staff member I am now facing an independent contractor contract.   
As you said in your original post, before getting taken off in various directions, what are the tax AND social charges in france? Like you, i realize there are a number of obvious answers, i.e. Tax should be paid on a non-staff contract and most probably in france. But what of the 21-45% of wondrous french social charges for the self employed?    
Surely lots of people are working independent contracts at the UN (and living in france) and most must bust the 35k auto (now micro) entrepreuneur limit in a few months. Is everyone paying 45% social charges as well as income tax? Knowing what rates are paid, i cannot imagine this is the case - so what is everyone else doing? Is there an exception to the social charges, since it is the UN? Do people register as sole proprietor in Geneva?    
Every official response leans towards ""any tax obligations are the contractors own business""..and this niche seems to baffle tax experts.   
Thanks for any informed responses!

But it is never open when I am in the area. So before I make a special trip into the city (something that takes planning on the order of military precision) any idea of prices?    
I ask because I once popped into another lamp store in the Altstadt, lured by a nice-but-not-really-unusual stained glass piece in the window. And then I saw the price... 150K.   And no, it was not a Tiffany original.  Beat a hasty retreat...

			Errrr ...nope.   
a) I have a business which is in its infancy. I will some cash over the next couple years when the big expansion comes, and may need premises far from here.   
b) I fully   staying here long term, but many people I know have just been made redundant (and spent 9 months looking for a job), so I am not confident that I will stay here if that happened.   
c) my ex wife is a nutter, so the fewer visible assets I have, the better.   
d) I have seen how many new apartments they are building in Opfikon, and wonder what the future holds for the value of my similar property.   
e) capital gains here is low and I'd rather keep my house in London which is doing very nicely.   
f) I have my own business which is doing very well but the ""salary"" I have   to pay myself is low therefore I can borrow only little.   
g) I am on a yearly contract and would love to stay here long term, but the client renews year on year so I can't commit.   
h) I want to remain in Langstrasse and spend all my money on fast women and booze.   
i) the same as (h) but insert pet obsession (boats, aeroplanes)   
j) ownership is more hassle than its worth (recent experience of haus-dispute here!)   
k) you can't choose you neighbours. Bad neighbours   cost thousands.   
l) I prefer to keep a balanced tax efficient liquid portfolio of diversified risk.   
m) I want to punt all my cash on the Chicago Mercantile.

			Just to follow up on the story -- we won the appeal in the Cantonal court      
Basically the Cantonal court said that the Friedensrichter was lying, and in the decision they even quoted the Constitution -- something about every citizen having the right to be protected against the bad judges (article 9 I think). Very happy to get this ruling! Mica, I am very sorry to say this here but the advice of your colleague was really bad and unprofessional, I would not recommend him to anybody   I am ready to give more details in PM to anybody interested.

			Great I will double check before ordering. How much should I tip the guy who delivers? I assume it would be two guys as one can't lift such large items.      Problem is that I have not found any shop that has similar items for reasonable price. For example a sofa I liked costs CHF 500 in IKEA but a similar one in Interio costs CHF 3500.

			Most people find IKEA furniture good enough to last 5 years.  
You can of course pay twice the price and get a bed that lasts 10 years.

			Are these medicines for dogs?   
For humans, the Swiss standard temperature range for 'most' medicines is 15'C to 25'C.   
There are exceptions such as insulin and others which require refridgeration.   
A lot of people take medicines regularly. I'm not sure any of those have specialized storage facilities. I know we don't.   
I'm sure you could find a cupboard somewhere (against a North facing wall, perhaps) where the temperature is within your range and fairly constant.   
(I have no knowledge of this but I did ask someone who deals with this stuff).

			Hi all,   
We've recently been given a camping stove (Camp Chef Everest MS2HP), which is a North American model, and need to find some propane cylinders.    
Here's the fine print:       I'm only now discovering that the cylinders sold here (CH/FR) are not the same fit. So I suppose I have two questions: (i) is it possible to buy these cylinders on our side of the pond, and if so, where?; or (ii) is there a converter that would do the trick?   
Thanks in advance!   
EDIT: I found a couple adapters here   --- maybe this is the way to go?   
EDIT2: Will purchase the Edelrid Valve Cartridge adapter. There is also the (slightly more expensive) Edelrid Puncture-Style Cartridge Adapter, and people have said that, with these two adapters, one will be able to fit any cartridge onto their screw-fitted stove.

			I have used the website called AnyVan many times, both within the UK and to bring stuff to Switzerland. You post an ad describing what you want transported, the route and when (you have the option to say flexible) and then you either wait for quotes, or invite the companies that match your requirements to offer a quote (I recommend that). Then you choose what works for you best, pay a small deposit to secure the job and pay the rest when the job is done. There are reviews from verified customers only and it works cheap usually because these small companies are already doing that route and your things just get added. For example, for 23 medium boxes and 5 pieces of luggage, I was offered a quote of £310. I hope this helps.

			I see no reason to assume that a pumpkin seed shouldn't be viable, assuming it has been harvested and stored correctly.   
But with much of the seed used in food production actually being hybridized, there is no guarantee that the offspring wil be anything like its parent.   
If you want to reproduce a succesful individual, you should really be buying the sibling seeds of its parents and granparents and starting from those.

There is a dump you can drive right into, they weigh your car on the way in and then after you dumped your stuff they weigh your car on the way out and you pay by weight...its not that expensive and really convenient when you have stuff like you describing.     
Its at a company called Risi AG and the actual dump is located on Ebertswilerstrasse, the entrance is +/- 600m up the road going up the hill to Ebertswil from the McDonalds circle in Sihlbrugg     
Here's a link,        
click on ""Aanfahrt Tannlimoos Risi AG"" for a map 
There is also a price list and opening times....the one downfall is they are not open every Saturday.

			you need to consider that the Whitestrips will whiten canine to canine. which may be enough for some... depending on how wide your smile is.  
to counteract the sensitivity use a high level fluoride (like elmex gelee) or a fluoride rinse - when using elmex use the orange, not the green (sensitive). it has a fluoride that stains, hence counteracting.   
also be aware, that it will not whiten intrinsic stain (within the tooth, happened during tooth development).

			Thantawan in Grosspeter (+41774453908) do a good Thai massage. So too do an outfit in Klybeckstr (+41787366899) but their premises are a bit open, although they were planning to move somewhere with more privacy and may have done so. The maseusses at both are friendly and generally speak English as well as German (and Thai!). Sandra Fourcet's therapeutic massage at Feel Harmony near Voltaplatz is very good (+41765304056), and she speaks English, French and German, and many gyms or hotels also provide massage. The Migros Fitnesspark near Heuwaage (+41585758150) throws in use of the gym, sauna and plunge pools etc if you book a sauna. Typical charges at all these places are CHF 80-100/hr, no tipping expected.   
These are all legitimate massage parlours with no funny business. There may be others. Because prostitution is legal in Switzerland you don't have to worry about ending up in the wrong place or finding yourself offered unwelcome additional services.

			I went to the photographer in the Hauptbahnhof, they have these cool machines where you pop in your CD and off it prints. I paid 0.95 per 10 by 15 print and the quality was good enough to stick in the photoalbum I compiled as my Gran's christmas present. They were super-friendly as well.  
If you want bigger prints (I think she said 13 by 18?), you bring along your pics on a USB stick.    
The place is the one by the 21-24 tracks at the back.

I confirm you can find spray paint in Jallut (at the rond-about below the pont Bessieres, near the elevator).   
You might also find some in a DIY store like Jumbo (in Bussigny) or OBI (in Renens) or if you live in town at la Coop Brico-Loisirs, rue de la Borde.   
Hope that helps.

			Sadly the Swiss' willingness to donate organs is rather low with the laudable exception of I think Ticino. If medical risk assessment turns out in favour of a transplantation there is in my opinion no reason to not honor the donor's wish even if he had some little or not relevant health issue himself...   
Edit: A new campaign has begun to raise awareness of the issue, it is named "" "". It got a mixed feedback but I think it is good!

			If you like Asian and funky, make a day trip to Aigle to Benoit Lange's store here:     
Click on the online shop and then ""mobilier"" and you will see a list of products.  You really need to visit, however, to get the whole vibe of this crazy store.  Having said that, much of the stuff is made in Indonesia and tends to crack at the glue joints, so, buyer beware.

Well, moved to BS in 2011 and have lived in GrossBasel ever since. Love the area and closeness to the city etc. Now have a growing family (wife + 2 kids) and need more space (also stuck up on third floor with no lift... getting tired of it). The apartment search has been a long, epic, shitty experience. Basically cannot find anything nice and affordable either in BS (prefer Gellert where currently live) or specific areas like binningen / bottmingen. Maybe im just too picky.. but there ares some seriously ugly flats out there.      
So, decided to stick Rheinfelden in the search field to see what comes up. On paper seems like a good deal (low tax etc.) and have just visited a nice flat.  Hence the question about the area. Anyway the basic needs are the same as most folks: walking distance to public transport, to the local shops, safe area, options for outdoor playing for kids etc. I would miss living in the city a lot.... but now with 2 kids, zero social life. Given the frequent train into Basel I thought this would make the area feel much closer than it is, but but maybe im being naive...

			Hi,   
I finally found what I was looking in Migros (A big one in Lowenstrasse in Zürich). It is called: Hahnendichtungen / Joints de robinetterie / Guarnizioni per rubinetti   
On the pack is written: 
6757.657 
* zu CH-Armaturen / pour robinets suisses / per rubinetti svizzeri 
* passend zu Norm-Oberteilen M20x1.25 von KWC, Similor-Kugler Egro, Arwa und M18x1 von KWC   
The outside diameter is 2mm bigger, but it fits on the pedal. It also has 4 rubber rings that I don't need (they don't have any hole), but at least, I got six on the package that I can use ;-)     
 Now I will see if it works.   
Thanks   
Josef   
The funny think is that I first went to Jumbo, which supposedly has much more supplies of this kind. Well: they don't have it. I asked, but the guy didn't have any idea, he told me that maybe I could get it on a Stationery or a bigger Jumbo. Well, I though, on a ""Stationary, really?"". That make me laugh, so, I tried my luck and went to the big Migros.

			Dear Catina,   
There are a few African operated places in the Langstrasse area,  and Brazilian and Cuban operated ones in the Oerlikon area.  However, depending on your hair texture and what you want done with it, you may wish to venture to Geneva - which is a bit more diverse - or even to London (two hour flight and you can spend the weekend), where the possibilities are endless...and you may even find an affordable one.  Good luck.

I would ask them for their bank details so you can pay both the item price & postal delivery price, remember to quote the Article Nr on the payment.   
If you pay on-line ok, but if you pay at the Postal Counter you need to allow another couple of CHF for the processing.

The most Important aspect of a Tour Operator with regard to transportation are the 'driver hours' and you won't get away without knowing anything about this.  
All buses are fitted with a tachograph, look it up on Wikipedia and read about the EU regulations (same applies to Switzerland) regarding shifts (max 12hr), rest hours (min 11), allowed driving duration (4.5hrs), etc, etc. As an example, you cannot create an itinerary (or operate. one) whereby you will force the driver to break the law on any day, say one day driving all the way to Paris without a break, not possible, he/she would need a 45 mins break after 4.5hrs with the engine off.

			We are one of the first streets on our postman's early morning swing.   
It is not unusual to catch him at the coffee shop swigging away whilst filling out the 'come and get it yourself' yellow forms which he delivers regularly along with the mail in lieu of ringing the bell and going through all   hassle.   
Does not even bother sculking.    
There have been complaints filed and he has been reprimanded a few times - to no avail.  The man is physically ailing and is doing his level best to hang out long enough to be the recipient of a decent retirement stash.   
So, as it turns out - a bit of exercise never hurt anyone.     
Okay, more like a long sulking walk to the post office filled with expletive outbursts.

			Just came across a situation today. While my SD card was in the pc, I accidentally deleted all the photos of my last holiday. Obviously they don't go to the recycling bin from there (cos they were saved on the camera memory card not on the pc).   
There is a way of retrieving such information which has been accidentally deleted and cannot be found in the recycling bin or by using 'search'. You need to use a program called 'Get Data Back for Fat'. It's self explanatory and easy to use (even I managed  ) When you save the program, do not save it on the drive from which the data was lost or deleted. Put it on an external drive connected to the pc or something like that.

			Thanks for the reply & helpful comments. We have both lived in Switzerland before, we are very fond of Swiss food & drink & know the rules (no noisy showers in the evenings!). I suppose we should get advice from a professional financial advisor?

Thanks so much to everyone who has replied so far we are still considering all the advice. But we really would take the risk if we thought we could squeeze enough of our income/savings to live in CH!

			Just for one week, try sleeping with your mattress on the floor, no extra support.  
And choose a thinner pillow, so your neck is not bent.    
Any longer and you risk mould forming on the underside of the mattress.    
Often the problem is not with the mattress, but with soft wooden slats or worse, a box spring mattress.

People start bidding as soon as the item goes on sale and if something is going to be sold it has normally pretty much founds its price 1 day before the end. Of course there may be hotly contested items, but I never seem to be selling those :-(  Ironically this would mean the automatic extension would be less relevant.  Sellers often put ludicrously high starting prices, like 70% of what they paid for it 2-3 years ago.

Clearly the authorities would wish to protect themselves against the sort of pension fraud, where a relative simply hauls dear old granny out of the deep freezer every now and then, to present to an official for the purpose of obtaining a certificate of existence, and thus ensuring the continuity of the pension payments.  
But a definition of existence which requires an intelligent response from the receiver of the pension benefit may, however, in many cases, be too strict and penalise those who are less aware of their surroundings, or maybe simply having a bad day.  
Maybe the ability to fog a mirror, or something similar, should be used to provide the basis of such a standardised existence test.

No idea if that's possible in Geneve or overnight, but the first option I'd try would definitely be the Geneva police as it would be them who handle the barring off of the reserved spot.

Plus where the breaker only detects excessive current on the live wire then potentially the neutral is handling much more current than it should. Also, if you want to add RCDs you then can't put the two circuits on separate RCDs. It's all been rewired now (with multiple RCDs)    
There is also the question of the type of circuit breaker -  B, C or D. Maybe the installed breaker is a B and you need a C to support the initial draw of the mixer?

508	null	null	null	null	"    I would say it depends on how serious and sophisticated you want to be with it. You can get a special repair kit or just simple putty. I think depending how bad it looks like after glueing job I would use some hard material and then paint it. make sure first the glue dries out completley.   
I find something that might help.       Make sure that the surface is completely dry. You may even want to aim your hair dryer at it on low for a minute or so just to be certain.   Get an epoxy adhesive to fill the crack. Make sure that you don't get the fast setting kind, because that won't hold up to water. Follow the package directions for mixing the two parts of the epoxy together. Then use a toothpick or an eye shadow applicator without the sponge on it to fill in the crack, and smooth out the repair.   Let the repair stand for about 24 hours.   When the epoxy has set, you can paint it with some appliance paint.   Now if you just have a chip out of some porcelain it's even easier to fix. Pick up a porcelain/enamel repair kit. This kit is has both a filler and paint that you mix together and paint on like a nail polish.

			Go to an OBI or any store you've mentioned. See their wide range of colors. Choose!!   
Most paints are available in Matt or gloss !!  
If you have toddlers/kids or are painting in an area where there are chances of spillage, use a gloss finish , as its very easy to wipe off!!

			Okay guys, behave. Not all newbies are familiar with forums. It's not a crime to ask a question even if it's been asked before.    
OP (Zurical, you're the Original Poster): It's hard to tell you what to bring because we don't know anything about you or how you live. Maybe you like to be surrounded by all things familiar and want to bring everything. Maybe you're more of a minimalist and prefer to just bring things that you either can't get here or are too pricey (whatever that means in your own terms).   
Here are a few threads to get you started:               
Brown sugar is a bit of a running joke here, but seriously - if you bake, bring some. In fact, bring extra to sell to other Forum members.    
Oh, and do you have limits on dimensions too? Many folks get a shipping container of a specific size that also has a weight restriction. You might be shipping 500 pounds of life-size giraffe statues for all they know.

			I had a similar issue with a Columbia jacket that I had purchased years ago in the US. US products have a life-time warranty and so I contacted Columbia in Europe. They asked me to send the jacket to them (no proof of purchase required) and they sent me back a jacket that was far better than the one I had sent in. I would definitely buy another Columbia jacket.   
It is really frustrating and disappointing when manufacturers don't take responsibility for substandard quality in their own products.

			Dear Malorie,   
welcome to Lucerne hopefully in 2017  
I am writing in because I'm just so passionate about the city #CoversEyes lol.   
to answer a few of your question from personal experience as a student, 
1.Apartments: rooms in a shared apartment cost min. approx. 500/600 every month (higher for studio apartments) I recommend the site wgzimmer.ch   
2.Basic Living costs can start anywhere from 1200Chf or less, depending on your lifestyle.   
3.Biking/Walking around: In the middle of the city Luzern you can walk to most places and biking is simply great and cheaper here.   
4.Language: Although most people get by with just speaking English, it is advisable to learn the local language (German and Swiss-German) to ease communication with locals and basically not feeling lost at train stations etc. haha!   
5. Safety: As Switzerland might be the most safe country in the world,that obviously trickles down to Lucerne   it is definitely safe and only general cautiousness(common-sense) is required.   
6. Lucerne is very beautiful and has so many sights to see,when you arrive you'd see for yourself    
towards the end of 2016 you can proceed with dealing with logistics and planning,BHMS offers you most of the help you will be needing and you have the forum for everything else you might need to know.

			(Assuming that by old glasses you mean spectacles...)     
Most opticians/optical shops will take them, usually working with one of the charity organization who distribute old specs to those in need. Just stop by any Optiker, ask if they participate in such a program.   
Lions Club is one group running a specs collection program, by the way. You could also contact the Zürich club directly.

			Our Commune (GEmeinde) owns vast areas of forest and sells wood by the stère (cubic metre) - it can deliver for extra, and cut to desired size, 50cm or 33cm, etc- and can sell fresh wood to store for next year, or 1 year/2 year old wood for use this year. Costs depends on all the above (a mix of ash and beech) Basic price:   
75 CHF new  80 CHF dry. Too far for you OP, but perhaps for anyone in NE/VD- probably much cheaper than in town.

(I did look up natural pharmacies in Bern but they don't have the eastern herbs and many european herbs they don't want to give out, although they use them when preparing mixtures themselves).   
Addition: if anyone is looking for bilberries (similar to blueberries), I found them at Manor and the Migros, something like 7 francs for 400gr perhaps. They make a great tincture.

			Before ordering anything, I would check which Swiss Norm machine you need. 
Is your old one a 76cm high and is sitting on the plinth? Or is it a 82cm which stands on the floor? The ""Zug"" is 76cm and the ""Miele"" is 82cm for eg. 
If you are a DIY type then I would try ""Nettoshop"". But first make sure you do'nt need a plumber (check if the stop tap is not chalked up).  
The new machines are all 220-230 volt, this should not give any problems.

			In my experience with Amazon, it doesn't really matter which carrier you are using for returning something. They do provide a shipping label for your convenience (and their cost), but if you send it with your own carrier, then it's up to you. 
Another option - not knowing where you live, might not be the right answer - would be popping up over the border and handing the package in personally at a Deutsche Post location.

			Anyway, I thought it was clear that everyone is going to hell so it makes little difference what you do on earth. Each of the major religions preach believe in our God (or Gods or prophets), repent your sins (if you have any - although for Christians it appears sin is a plus as long as you confess - the ""Get out of jail free card"" of religion) otherwise you are damned to eternity with a hot poker up your ring piece, a thousand lashes daily and Barrry Manilow on a, turned up tp 11, infinite loop.

			I am thinking of buying something online from Bergfreunde.de I see that they deliver free in Switzerland (over 100 euro) but am not sure how the VAT issue is handled. They don't charge either Swiss or German VAT on their website so I am concerned that I will get a bill from the Swiss customs for 8% plus a processing (""Bearbeitungs"") fee. They also use DHL to deliver with whom I have not had positive experiences here in Switzerland. Has anyone any experience with ordering to a Swiss address with this company?

			As a Swiss citizen you have the right to live and work in Switzerland (and also in the EU for that matter). Your challenge will be to integrate sufficiently by being able to communicate in a Swiss language so that you can support yourself after arriving. Here are some thoughts on this:   
1) Take an integration course, including a German language course, for a year. Apply for apprenticeships while studying. (See translated article below). 
2) Get a job as an au pair for a year with a German-speaking family to help you master the language and begin applying for apprenticeships. 
3) Begin applying directly for an apprenticeship starting summer 2016 while you are taking your current German language course.    
Below is a translated newspaper article about how Canton Vaud place young people between 19 and 25 years old in apprenticeships:       
For more information on an integration course, try googling on ""integrationskurs"". This is an example for Canton Zurich. Use Google Translate to read in English:       
This website has au pair offers:     
Also, you might wish to become familiar with the Auslandsschweizer-Organisation's website:       
Good luck to you!

			Hi all,     
This is a lovely website if you want to make the magic of Christmas a little more real for your kids.  Its a free video that you personalize and it is sent to you for your child to watch.  I've done this for my son since he was 3 and he was utterly enthralled and super excited that Santa knew who he was.     
I've done it again for him this year, but I do suspect he is just humouring us with regards to still believing in Santa, but its fun anyway.           
Hope I'm allowed to post this link, if not please let me know and I will delete.

			As I live in near Zurich, I am using the Swiss Paket services ( )   
They give you an address for free, where you can buy things from all over Europe and ship it there. Then we receive an email whenever a package arrives so we can go and pick it up at the store.    
I have been using this service and purchased things from: France, UK and Germany without any issues. Regarding the size or cost of the products we have purchased, we got from cheap 10 euros things to 2500 euros double decker bed for my nephew which was half the cost than in Switzerland (exactly same product).   
They charge you per package for relative small packages its around 3 Euros, so its really worth it if you save a lot of money on the article you have purchased.   
What I usually do before I take a decision to buy something of more than 50 bucks is to check the price at TopPreise.ch then look for the same article at Amazon.de and use the price I see as a reference, if the difference is too high I just buy it on Amazon.de and then make it ship to my address in Germany.   
On this post, I explain how the process works to recover the TAX from Amazon.de     
Hope this helps you!   
Best regards!

Looks like that thing got repurposed for power supply. Clearly low-voltage; of course it serves its purpose, since it is polarized (important for LEDs), and these days no one has an old power amplifier to which it could be accidentally connected.    
In other words, you'll need the right power supply (wall wart or whatever).

			Hello all and thanks for the welcome. Yes I realize this is a year or so later... I resigned myself to the package being lost and then:   
The package did eventually arrive about 3 months later. What I learned by asking around (I speak French so I was able to have a chat to some of the post office clerks) was that you need the appropriate customs form, CN22 or CN23 I think they're called, on the parcel. This particular package didn't have said form describing the contents so I think it got held up for checking. Everything was opened inside it, anyway.   
Royal Mail should know this and if you get the right postal clerk in the UK you're OK. If not, not so fun.   
Parcel companies and the likes of AmazonGlobal pre-clear their parcels somehow, which is why it looks like you ordered 200 different varieties of barcode I think.   
One of the recipes was a variation on this. (but I replaced the yoghurt with butter and the sweetener with actual sugar because I like real cake). They look horrible but they're very tasty, especially fresh out of the oven.

			Yeah, that sounds good. A mini apero...   
As an American I find this Swiss custom quite strange. I'm used to people coming and introducing themselves, welcoming you to the neighborhood, maybe bringing a small symbolic gift, etc.  Quite the opposite of having to present yourself to the new neighbors in an attempt to prove your worthiness and win their approval...

You can take bikes to donate to the Gepackschalter at most Swiss train stations, as well as other collection points. There is a search field in the link above to find your nearest collection point.   
If you take it to a Bahnhof Gepackschalter you will need a transport Gutschein which you can get from the organization (gratis) - fill out the contact formula.

			I found this dead thread when looking for an answer on how to disconnect the high pressure hose from a Karcher K5 pressure washer.    
The black connector at the machine end has an arrow on each side. You have to push the connector down in the direction of the arrow to remove the hose. If anyone is having trouble moving that black connector in the direction of the arrow, make sure the machine is switched off and give the trigger a squeeze. The hose stores high pressure water inside. You need to let this out for the disconnect mechanism to work. The last bit of water will squirt out, and you can move the connector.    
I hope this helps somebody.

On second thoughts, having discussed the viewpoint of the comedian who wrote this, with other folk, I actually don`t think it is a good idea to adopt that attitude.  I don`t think any attitude would help or hinder their cause.   
The only attitude (in my and many others opinions)  to make any effect is to collectively (Europe) to institute what the military use in their own training  - ""Collective Guilt"".     
In this way people who appreciate and care about living peacefully in a safe environment help to protect their own interests.  One (or more) person/s guilty of planning or instituting violence causes them  to lose their privileges - losing their ""safe asylum"" status and are all expelled (guilty in cohesion).   
Each center of refugees is collectively responsible for the behavior of their compatriots.  Any guilty person is then not protected by the others - they either behave or get reported to the authorities.   
Same as in the military.  One person defying authority causes everyone to lose their privileges.   They don`t do it again - because the others have much to lose.  If they defy their co-living compatriots - they suffer.  In this way any subversive/criminal elements would be sorted out.  And allow the host country to continue supporting those who truly deserve asylum.

			Had a great experience today and thought I'd share............ volunteered with Tischlein Deck Dich today.     
Website:     
Wasn't sure if fluent German was a requirement but I wrote them anyways and they answered that they were happy to have me come by for hands-on training.    
I am at an A2 level in German-- the first part of A2 and so although I can understand most conversation, speaking is difficult.     
The wonderful ladies in Bern at Pauluskirche put me at ease and explained everything to me in high German and together, 5 of us unloaded food delivery and organized it on tables and met with the recipients and distributed the food.   
Each recipient who comes to this organization, has already pre-registered with a card and it's good for a year.  They can come weekly to collect free groceries donated by organizations who have extras to give away or goods close to the expiry date.     
Every week, the delivery load is different and the volunteers distribute according to the number of people in in the household which is written on the card.     
Today, I helped to sort and distribute, bottles of Pepsi, Juice, gingerbread cookies, butter cookies, muesli, yoghurt, chocolate ice-cream, cakes, Lindt chocolates, salad dressing, canned corn, vacuum pack red beets, bread, cream cheese,Beck Bakery products  fresh produce such as  carrots, potatoes, lettuce and cauliflower donated by farmers in the Seefeld region.    
Total volunteer time was about 2 1/2 hours.   
Great experience giving back to Switzerland and there are many locations throughout the country.   
Bern is in great need of volunteers at the moment - the more volunteers the faster the set-up and clean-up.     
Please consider Tischlein Deck Dich if you have a couple hours to spare -- great service and great people!

			Hi! I just enrolled to the Dual Degree Basel/Edinburgh. Anyone has any impressions about the course? How did it impact your professional life? Is it a good invested money? I couldn't find any bad opinions about the program. I know, it is not recognisable as IMD or St. Gallen, but possibility of studying in Basel, flexibility of coursed, money input and my craving for some business knowledge encouraged me to undertake  this adventure.

			But that would be the version reloaded, imho, not for dummies.     
We don't know if OP speaks Italian, and whereas Swiss local bureaucracy can sometimes be nasty, the Italian version of it is a nightmare.   
I'm none of those who look down on Southern Europe in general and Italy in particular (as a matter of fact, I know quite well what Switzerland's problems are, and there are loads of them), but I don't think that for a newbie in Switzerland and, at the same time, in Italy, to be a commuter from Italy would be an easy task.

My grandfather always said, ""cheap is dear."" Look for a reliable company, read all the fine print regarding insurance coverage and loopholes, and you will again need to arrange transport and customs clearance from Germany, unless you have a van and plan to do that part yourself. It is not difficult but you need to have your papers in order as you will be liable for the 8% MWST.     
I think you should be on site to inspect the goods when they arrive in Germany because if anything is damaged and you only discover it once at your own home, you could be in a battle over where the damage took place.

			I will be in the Hague next week for a congress, can anyone recommend any decent bars and restaurants? Preferably Asian cuisine, but I'm willing to try traditional Dutch (whatever that may be). 
I'll be based at the Worldhotel Bel Air, which is just opposite Zorgvilet and on the edge of Statenkwartier.

It's really good to know that Switzerland finally has a cashback site.   
But if you do still have a UK bank account, then it's worth shopping around.  Here's how two UK cashback sites compare to RabattCorner.  (Obviously, the rates change from week to week.)       
That TopCashBack/Venere deal is amazing.     
If you book your hotel via Venere, you can get 22.17% of your money back again (if you have a UK bank account) !!  Blimey.   
Most importantly though, if you have relatives back in the UK, get them to sign up to one of these sites.  They'll earn a fortune, it's  , particularly when you buy a high-commission product, like a mobile phone or internet contract, or buy house/car insurance.

If the person has more than one account and/or different products and services active, then mail will still come until all of that has been switched to a new address or completely closed down and erased from the bank's database. To do that the bank has to be in contact with the holder of the account(s)/service(s).

There is a decent size stand-alone store in Zug near Zugerland. By far the biggest Halloween area/store/loctation I have seen since moving here. I have not been inside though.

I have also removed some very stubborn screws and bolts with it. Fast too. As for the hammer drill setting compared to battery drills. No contest. Proper hammer drills are on another level. Although I believe that you can buy professional hammer drills that are battery powered. Have Lots of cash for this drill? Not realy an option for us. With spare batteries etc the cost is not viable.   
Lastly you need this. A bosch metal/electical detector. Otherwise it is just a matter of time untill you drill through a electrical wire or a water pipe. Unless of course you know 100% what is inside the wall and where.

I'm looking for a household goods store that would sell drawer organizers/dividers or small boxes I can use to subdivide drawers for baby clothes storage. I know Ikea has them, but it's a long trip on public transit for one set of organizers.    
Anyone know of a store that sells household goods like this more centrally located and accessible by transit in Zurich?

			@chinensis8   
Here's an idea... Are you sure that your room-mate wants a replacement just like (or very similar to) that exact vase?  If so, could she perhaps ask the person who gave it to her, where it was bought, explaining that you will replace it?   
If she does not, in fact, need exactly such a thing, but would be glad of any nice vase (or something else for her home) perhaps you could offer to take her to Globus and let her choose one herself, and you pay for it.  If she likes the idea, then it might be a feel-good moment for her, reminding her of the gift she'd received, and feeling your goodwill.  If you decide on inviting her along to choose, you might like to go to Globus first, on your own, to be sure of the kinds of prices there.

			As shown by the Zürich city ban, you need to ask the respective Kanton and Gemeinde if you want to be  perfectly sure about drone regulations, if any. Federal regulation can  be found  .   
Take note that if your drone weighs more than 500g, BAZL requires liability insurance  covering at least 1million. Even bewlow that weight you probably want to  make sure your insurance covers damage caused by your drone.   
I think the lenews article is wrong in multiple aspects: 
-  Mario Cortesi is spokesman of Zürich city police. Per August last year  the city has banned all drones. This particular ban covers Zürich city  only. 
- BAZL, the responsible federal agency, speaks of a minimum  perimeter of 100m around gatherings (""Menschenansammlungen""), i.e.  people that form a kind of group of at least two dozen people. That  aspect alone allows for a drone to fly over Winterthur Bahnhofstrasse or  Basel Bahnhofplatz even during rush hour as these people, despite their  big number, don't constitute a ""Ansammlung"". 
- EU regulations may influence swiss rules, but they have no direct effect here. In this sense they're irrelevant here.

No, I would say not... Customs clearance is quite different... swizterland there were lots of documents, Australia you will have the added problem of potentially needing to fumigate your whole container and having everything inspected to make sure there are not any animal or plant products that pose a risk.   
plus, some companies specialise in 'inbound' and some with 'outbound'...   
If I needed to do it again, though, I would definitely toss up air-freight vs sea...

			You may want to try to walk in and to show them your specific desired picture. I have found that usually at least one English speaking stylist is available in many of the salons, so I definitely would ask in person, receive a clear answer, and know what you're getting before just going on recommendations since many stylists claimed to be able to do everything. Better to dwell on the safe side so you're satisfied!   Be wishes finding the ideal stylist.

			Guys / gals   
We're looking at (yet another) apartment in Zollikon, hoping to find that right combination of what-we-need versus what-our-dog-needs. We may have found something, but I'd like to get an idea of what the grocery shopping is like.   
My girlfriend really loves the Metalli Migros grocery store in Zug, and even the Coop Herti is pretty nice, but the Migros up the hill in Rüschlikon, for example, is something she hates. Dark, poorly laid out, ugly... not a pleasant shopping experience.   
Any idea how the grocery stores in Seefeld / Zollikon stack up? Thanks for the input!

Legs firmly braced for comments...     
Many thanks in advance.

1. Catch the ferry from Circular Quay across to Taronga Zoo. Take the chairlift up to the top of the hill and then walk down. Take a picnic lunch and a water bottle rather than relying on the food there, which is poor quality and expensive. 
2. Explore the area from The Rocks (oldest area) around under the Harbour Bridge, and then walk across to the Opera House and up through the Botanical Gardens. 
3. Get into the restaurant food - but steer clear of the city, as it is expensive. Check out the Good Food Guide and Cheap Eats for recommendations.   
I can't comment on Victoria, but the Ocean Road is a good start. Crayfish (lobsters) are famous as you get closer to the South Australian border.   
If you are interested in surf beaches, I would avoid the Sydney ones. They are good beaches, but very crowded and the water is not as warm as it is further north. There are some wonderful ones a few hours north of Sydney - around Taree/Kempsey or further north around Byron Bay (although Byron itself is very crowded). Or fly to Brisbane and drive an hour and a half north to the Sunshine Coast (way better than the Gold Coast in my opinion). If you go to the Sunshine Coast, you could also visit Steve Irwin's Australia Zoo, which is worth a visit. The beaches in North Qld don't have surf, and in the summer months you can't swim off the coast because of the marine stingers - you need to travel out to the islands.   
Emirates is a good airline, with a good entertainment system and food. If your stopover in Dubai is longer than 6 hours (I think - check!), you can request to be taken to one of their hotels for a nap and meal. It is worth doing.   
As for museums etc, my advice would be to keep your eyes peeled when you are driving around and be prepared to stop on a whim. There are many strange and wonderful things around!

			I have used the Post Restante service for receiving a small expensive parcel at the Saint Louis post office in France, everything went well the second time... the problem is knowing when the item has been delivered. Post Restante only keep the item 10 days, then it is sent back. So if you have a tracking service it should work OK for you.

			Hi All,  
I know this is an old post but I came upon it as I was wondering where to print photos in Zug.  As always, the forum has the answers  , so I went off to InterDiscount to print my photos. Managed to navigate my way through the German on the machine (fortunately it had good symbols & pictures as my German is horrendous). Got to the end feeling proud of myself and then nothing happened! No photos printed. So I had to seek help and discovered that you need to print a receipt from the machine, pay the cashier, then enter the code from the till receipt into the photo machine to print the photos.   
The photos were very glossy. Not sure if there was a Matt option and my limited German missed it. Some seemed to have a brownish tinge to them, but they were fine for the purposes of sending to friends and family.  Cost was 50 cents each and I printed 19.

			Another comment about choosing a gardening firm:   
While you likely will have to pay for quotations if you do not use the firm in the end - anywhere from CHF 500 to 1500 each - you would nonetheless be wise to get quotes from several different firms. The cost variation can be huge - choose the wrong firm and you can end up overpaying by an eye-watering amount.   
To give you an example, quotes for our project ranged from the low 5 figures to mid 6 figures. And this for a small garden. That's a huge price difference!   
Beware that some - perhaps many - garden firms are actually 'outside living space building firms', plantsmanship is not their focus. Hence you see so many rock gardens with three spirea stuck in the middle rather than plant-filled gardens.      
If what you are after is a garden full of plants, and if you have even a slightly green-ish thumb - perhaps consider having a someone do the hardscaping for you and then do the planting, including sourcing your plants, and maintenance yourself. The plant that a landscape firm will charge you CHF 50-100 for can often be bought at a garden center for CHF 5-10. Not to mention, the fun of a garden is in the planting...   
This is what we did in the end - we found a contractor who could do the hardscaping that was too heavy or specialized for us, and then we did all the planting. And saved a significant amount over even the lowest quote from a gardening firm.   
And finally a money saving tip:   
I wanted to terrace the slope leading out from my patio with granite to make an herb garden, planting in-between the granite walls. But the typical granite blocks you see here would have taken up three to four times the space, planting space I couldn't afford to lose in this small garden. So instead of blocks I used granite Stelen. Same effect but a fraction of the price, and I have more room to plant. A bonus - building this way did not reqire bringing a crane into the garden itself to do the placement - one less permit, one less potential stumbling block with the neighbors, less damage to the access area.   
The person who came up with this solution was not the landscaping firm - they all wanted to use granite block - but the gentleman at the quarry. As you do your preliminary planning go directly to the source, talk to the folks who sell the materials. They often have practical ideas.   
Good luck with your project!

			The dry cleaner in Germany quoted 37 Eur to clean a mattress cover. (single mattress)     
Then I looked at my Miele washing machine specs and it will wash up to 8 kg. The mattress cover is washable.(but cannot go in the dryer). I have washed duvets and pillows - I have a special cycle that begins by spinning the air out of these items first.     
If an item is washable, I would try that before dry cleaning.

			Nice work taking a simple matter of returning an item and making it a greek drama...   
Contact the seller, tell him to return the part and ask for a refund minus shipping and a restocking fee.   
What's the whole fuss about? And why is someone that simply wants to return something treated as an a-hole or a criminal? Timewaster? WTF?   
People are perfectly allowed to return items they don't want, and business are perfectly allowed to respond however they so choose. 
Generally speaking, returns are accepted, and some times restocking fees are applied, some times not. Many times actually the convenient handling of returns is a marketing tool for many sellers.   
So yeah, it's not the end of the world, and yes it does happen a lot.

			This thread deserves a bump. If anyone is interested in early to mid 20th century books on all kinds of subjects (novels, vintage cars, drama, biography, WWII and so on), you'd be crazy to pass up a chance like this. There are several original Penguin paperbacks from the sixties, bags upon bags of other paperbacks, several boxes of leather bound beauties (somewhat depleted now  ) and all sorts of good stuff.

Aren't these points of sale obliged to take electrical items? Is there a limit on the quantity of items one can take? I don't see how a limit can be implemented in any case. All you have to do is make several separate trips over time. You're not obliged to purchase anything. 
If points of sale/the post offices do refuse to take items then they are encouraging illegal dumping of electrical goods elsewhere.   
Charities are already a dumping place for rubbish. Try going for a walk early morning down any streets with a couple of charity shops along them. Overnight, over the weekend, boxes and sacks are often dumped outside these shops by people wanting to get rid of items and rubbish. The charities already have to dispose of all that and presumably nearly always have to pay to do so. But again here, if the per-bag rubbish tax were abolished there wouldn't be this problem as everyone would be able to throw all of their rubbish away hassle-free and free of charge and not think up different, convenient ways of dumping rubbish, - like 'donating it' to charity shops.   
I actually know someone who works in a charity shop and they told me that a large part of what is dumped outside the shop whilst it is closed is completely unfit for resale, they have even had sacks of ordinary household waste dumped overnight on a regular basis with a few good items, like clothes and books at the top of the sack - but underneath it was packed full of empty food packets, milk cartons, polystyrene, washing detergent bottles, even the small black pet faeces bags (used) - and there isn't really anything they can do about this, after all it is not illegal to 'donate to a charity shop'.

			Hi,  
I got almost 2 years ago the Epson Home Cinema 730HD after reading lots of reviews. 
Has resolution of 1280 x 720 (720p) and mostly used to watch movies, not TV. In almost 2 years has around 500hrs of lamp use and working fine. 
The price was a little bit over 500CHF, but to be honest less that that you won't find good quality projectors.   
The only negative which I think most of the medium-range projectors have is that watching it with light during the day is not that good.   
Now you have better models with more resolution if needed around same price. 
Also check the Optoma ones,although those ones are more expensive   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Nov 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Beamer/Projector for Home	Zurich2009	Posts: 38

When just starting a new job it is very difficult NOT to put in the extra hours to establish oneself, equally important to guard against 15 hr days becoming the norm and not the exception. I know both men and women who have been through this - there is also a female tendency to feel ""guilt"" so the double standard is not clear-cut, as much as self-imposed.   
It was very usual for me to be left alone with a <1 yr old and eventually another young child in a new location, but that was very special time too as we established our own daily rhythms and rituals and discovered new surrounds.   
I suspect the most contradictory emotions for OP at this stage are centered around having left a job she enjoyed for new frontiers, and hearing that click of the door when OH goes off to work to the energy and routines of a workplace. It is an eery silence...

*   german online interface, gets you 5 quotes 
*   german interface, gets you quotes   
*   reviews of removal companies and cleaning companies.   
* Have your top few come visit and give you a customized quote. They will vary about 25% plus or minus.  
* Make sure to have insurance, abgabegarantie (garanty at time of handover to old landlord for cleaning), and ask to be billed for services instead of cash on moving day.

			Jelmoli department store and Jelmoli mail order are two separately run companies.    
I have ordered mattresses and bed frames from them - a few years back. Reliable service. Cheap delivery up to the front door (even if you live on the 4th floor without a lift). Quality was fine (they were brand products, so no surprises there) and prices very reasonable. I would certainly choose them over IKEA for the delivery service alone.   
I occasionally order clothing and other things from them. So can recommend the Jelmoli mail order.   
AFAIK there  is no warehouse that you can go and visit. That's a disadvantage if you're looking for something in a particular colour or if you want to test-sleep/sit. But still, give them a call: customer service should know more than I do    
Another online shop for furniture with free delivery and good service is   - however, it's a little more on the ""traditional"" design side.

But what I don't understand is how this dutyfree rule actually makes any difference to the cost of running the airline.   (Apart from generating more cash for the company). Passengers have to carry their own hand luggage onto the plane and store it for themselves, so you don't have to pay a baggage handler to do this, or the flight attendants. So why have the rule? The only reason I can possibly think of is to speed up the boarding process - we all know how annoying it is to be stood behind some business man on the flight carefully packing away his overnight case, laptop, overcoat and dutyfree into the overhead lockers whilst the rest of the plane waits in the rain on the steps up to the plane, but how much time will you really save?

			I can't recommend any jewelers in Zurich, but I can recommend a few tips for buying.    
Since you want white gold, be sure to ask if it has been rhodium-plated. This will make the shine last much longer. Make sure you know both the ring size for the finger, and what width of band you want. A woman's band is usually 2-4 mm in width for comfort, whereas a man's is often 6-8 mm.   
These two points are very important, as once you have the item engraved it usually cannot be returned. If you're not 100% positive on both the ring size and band width, I recommend getting the ring only, and doing the engraving later once you're certain it's a comfortable fit.   
Given how high prices for ""luxury items"" are in Switzerland, in your shoes I would seriously consider purchasing online or in Germany and having the engraving done here. Happy shopping!

			Ask your educational institution's reception or building management people whether they have this. Someone may have handed it over to them.

this is my first post. I hope I'm writing to the right section, but if not please redirect me.    
I am an Italian guy, playing saxophone since some years. When I lived in Italy I used to play in a big Funky/Disco Band and I would like to continue playing now I live in Zurich.   
I am quite open to different alternatives: could be a small trio/quartet (jazz/funk) or a bigger project with an already formed band. 
If anybody is interested please PM me.    
Alternativley, if someone knows some (online or real) place where I can get in touch with musicians please redirect me.   
Thanks!

			Before you go into DIY mode, do check to see if a firewood 'Hüsli' requires a permit in your Gemeinde.    
It does in ours - which we found out the hard way. Once that woodpile is turned into a neat, orderly stack with weather protection it becomes a building - and if over 60cm or 100cm (in our Gemeinde) it requires written permission from your neighbors. If neighbors refuse and one still wants to go ahead, a 'Kleinbau' permit from the Gemeinde is needed.   
But as always in Switzerland, YMMV. Check your local regs.   
Good luck with your project.

Your Apartment is modern enough that it is almost certainly reinforced concrete (as opposed to drywall, or plaster/lath). The ""plaster"" skim is only a few mm thick, and it isn't plaster nowadays either. No risk of chunks falling down at all. You may have bad luck and hit the rebar, but on a ceiling that would mean that you have drilled your hole WAY too deep.     
Low/mid market priced wall mounted rail Systems are available at IKEA, or any Baucenter. Top market can get breathtakingly expensive, A while back I helped a neighbor install his designer rails: over 10K CHF for the rails alone to cover 5 Windows! They are cool as all get out, but...

833	04.05.2015, 22:30	Member	Thanked 92 Times in 45 Posts	Location: Basel	"    I moved out of Allschwil into BS because of the plane noise. 
In the summer they crank up the charter flights from 6am onwards at the weekends, and they mostly take off and climb over Allschwil, on a curve directly over the dorfplatz. 
Also they run up the engines from 5am, and if the wind is blowing towards Allschwil it is pretty clear.   
It's a real pain if you have the windows open or want to sit outside, IMHO. 
Depends on your tolerance to noise, I never got used to it. 
There's a cafe in the dorfplatz and a couple of restaurants, go and sit outside for an hour and see what you think, on a day when the planes are climbing out over Allschwil.   
The Sunday evening 747 cargo plane is pretty impressive though, as is the Super Constellation.

			I made the mistake of ordering from the UK at first (Isabelle Oliver). Came with huge import tax bill and the sizes were totally wrong. I ended up sending most of the stuff back. 
In the end, I bought bigger sizes at Zara and Esprit (big jeans), maternity wear at H&M in Bahnhofstrasse (great breast-feeding tops which you can already start wearing) and funnily enough beach dresses from Roxy and the likes.  
The problem with shorts was that my bump kept on growing and growing, so I had to switch to dresses in the final 2-3 months. Also, my legs were so swollen towards the end, I was glad they weren't on display!

 NO one will answer this question.  If they do know, they admit to the world that they too failed at bike maintenance 101.   
Whether you do it yourself or not, I would find a good bike shop in Germany you can trust.  Most likely, the pries will be better and you will either need to buy the basic tools there or be on a first name basis with the mechanic.  You may be visiting often...

			This isn't going to be helpful but I think even the experts need to know more than you have said here to give an accurate answer.  
'to start braces'  most folk have braces because they need them. If you need them do you know exactly what type you require? 
'2-yr braces' I thought one wore them until the problem was solved and then probably had another system to make sure the problem didn't return. Are you sure 2-years is the limit? 
If you plan to go to England at the weekend to have them done, can you ensure that the guy will always be able to do them exactly when you need adjustments? If they are uncomfortable (understatement) or something goes wrong with them, you won't want to wait for ages to have them looked at.

If the law of a foreign country applies, then surely only a court of that country can order the debt to be collected. Can a foreign court order a Swiss debt collector to collect a debt? Switzerland may have agreements with EU countries and others over mutual collection of traffic fines and possibly other debts. But does this extend to say countries like Tonga? I doubt it.

			Tfhanks for that reply.    
I saw some of the yellow sweet corn in Coop, but at least still covered with the leaves, and bought some.  Steamed them in their skins, and they were actually delicious (reminiscent of the South African mealies).   
I`ve planted some of the yellow corn in vege garden this year to try it out for myself.  I think if cooked in their skins they retain a bit of ""lekker"" flavour.  "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Feb 2007	Groaned at 145 Times in 99 Posts	Green mealies (?)	smoky	Posts: 3,318

Budgeting 2 to 3 trips a year to recharge in Texas would help cope. Your kids could pick up a new language, and it is centrally located in Europe, for touring.   
Just one other point of comparison I wanted to add.  Its relatively safe here, and the crime rate is low.  I think there is less factor of fear of your fellow human beings hetr. So in other words, you didn't really need firewrms here.  . But yeah, I know Austin is a relatively enlightened place. Just sayin.

These are the ones I bought:       
They are rated up to 45 kg, and they do seem very strong (and easy to fit!). I think mine were 450 mm long (£6.50 per pair), but they also do some at 300 mm (£4.50 per pair) and 250 mm (£3.74 per pair).   
They also do heavy duty ones in a range of lengths.

			By Bert Archer 
18 May 2015 
La Chaux-de-Fonds is not a tourist town. Its location, 1,000m up in the Jura mountains  one of Switzerlands most scenic regions  means the air is crisp, the clouds are close and the mountain peaks are closer. 
Its packed full of low-key attractions, including many surprisingly stealthy Art Nouveau apartment block lobbies (none of which look like you can just walk into, but all of which you can) and the tucked-away, abstract chrome monument dedicated to Louis Chevrolet, the motor company-founding race car driver who was born and raised here in the 1870s and 80s. The father of literary modernism, poet and filmmaker Blaise Cendrars, was born on one of the streets facing Chevrolets monument four months earlier. Le Corbusier, the father of architectural modernism, who was also born and raised in La Chaux-de-Fonds about a decade after Chevrolet and Cendrars. 
For any other town of 37,000 residents, this would be more than enough to build a tidy tourist business on. But La Chaux-de-Fonds is a practical, hard-working town and not much for showing off. It made sense, then, thatd Id never heard of this town before arriving. And I certainly had no idea that its where the world's most expensive watches are made. 
More than that, La Chaux-de-Fonds is essentially the watchmaking capital of the world, home to the workshops or corporate headquarters of Rolex and Patek Philippe, Tissot and Girard-Perregaux, Ebel and Omega, many of which were founded here. Messrs Vacheron and Breguet, two of the first men to make a success of Swiss watchmaking, started their workshops in the middle of the 18th Century in Geneva, but La Chaux-de-Fonds, about 150km to the northeast, is where Swiss watchmaking became the world standard. It was here that Daniel Jeanrichard (1665-1741), the regions first watchmaker, developed a system of apprenticeship and cultivated watchmaking as a local cottage industry. As early as 1867, Karl Marx held up the town and its system as an example of efficient industrialisation in his seminal work Das Kapital, saying that in his day, this small town was producing five times the number of watches than in all Genevas workshops combined. Today, La Chaux-de-Fonds remains the administrative, and in many ways the spiritual, heart of the Swiss watch industry. 
As we ducked out of one of the Art Nouveau apartment block lobbies, hidden behind thoroughly quotidian-looking front doors, I remarked at how wide the road was, an oddity for a town as old as this. My guide Claudine Buehler, whose husband, father, uncle, aunt and grandfather all work or worked in the watchmaking business, explained that the buildings were laid out this way in the early 19th Century to maximize the amount of sunlight that could flood into the first-floor workshop windows. Looking into one of these windows, I could imagine how the town must have been, street after sunlit street, with lone craftsmen bent over their workbenches, each making a tiny part that would contribute to the thousands of watches being made. Many of these original workshops have been turned into apartments now, but small open-door shops still populate those same streets, where third- and fourth-generation craftspeople continue to make the mainsprings, bridges and balance cocks that power some of the world's most exquisite and pricey timepieces. 
Given La Chaux-de-Fondss watchmaking history, its little surprise that the town is also home to the International Clock-making Museum. One of my favourite exhibits explained how a pocket watch designed between 1796 and 1800 by Breguet told the time with little pins that would jab its owner in the hand, allowing him to check the time without pulling it out of his pocket and potentially revealing his boredom to the person  boss, emperor or spouse  in whose company he found himself. The museum also has the worlds first quartz timepiece: the upright, four-drawer filing cabinet-sized contraption that almost killed La Chaux-de-Fonds. 
In 1968, more than 11,000 people  47% of the workforce  were employed by the towns watch companies. By 1975, that number had dropped to just a little more than 7,000, as the industry struggled with the advent of the quartz watch. Watchmakers had laboured for centuries to keep time as precisely as possible, perfecting the basic mechanical system of transferring energy from a coiled spring through an escapement to the balance wheel to create as close to perfectly regular oscillation as possible. And they got pretty good, with watches that were accurate to within seconds a day. But quartz technology, which took advantage of the minerals much more stable rate of oscillation, made watches accurate to within seconds a year  at prices in the dozens, rather than the hundreds or thousands of dollars being charged for mechanical Swiss watches in the 1970s. 
For the next 20 years, it looked as though Swiss watches were going the way of the buggy whip, until some executives, led by Patek Philippes Philippe Stern, decided they could compete on luxury and craftsmanship rather than accuracy. The plan worked  a few decades on, the Swiss industry is more profitable than its ever been  but the war hasnt been won. La Chaux-de-Fonds next quartz-sized challenge will be to measure up against the technology behind products like the iWatch, which hit markets on 24 April. Using satellite global positioning, the watches produced by Apple and Google may be even more accurate than quartz. Of course, how technology will measure up against craftsmanship this go around only time will tell. 
After the museum, Buehler dropped me off at one of the towns larger workshops, Girard-Perregaux, which is famous among aficionados for the watchs three-bridge tourbillons. Many of the workshops in La Chaux-de-Fonds offer free tours. 
After learning some history  it was the first company to manufacture all watch parts under one roof, and the first to manufacture in large numbers after Kaiser Wilhelm ordered, 2,000 Girard-Perregaux watches for his naval officers in 1880  my tour guide Willy Schweizer and I walked through the various work rooms, where parts made in La Chaux-de-Fonds smaller workshops are assembled by master watchmakers. Another room was devoted entirely to engraving each part, visible or not, with tiny decorative patterns. 
As we walked around watching the engravers, enamellers and guillocheurs do their work, I was surprised to see that many of the watchmakers were fairly young. I had pictured men with failing eyes and greying beards hunched over their worktables, mallets and brushes flying about. But the average age of the women and men making these watches, among the best made anywhere, is about 30. Even more striking, especially for Switzerland, is that a lot of them are immigrants; in fact, 30% of La Chaux-de-Fonds population is foreign-born. According to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, craftspeople from around the world are being drawn to the industrys explosive growth, with worldwide sales more than doubling from 2000 to 2014. 
Schweizer told me that each worker at Girard-Perregaux gets their own 6,500 euro watch after working for the company for two years. Youd expect then, to see every wrist bedecked, but Id been paying attention, and the most expensive watch Id seen was a 450 euro Tissot, with most people wearing less expensive Swiss brands like Certina or Hamilton. After a day or so exploring La Chaux-de-Fonds, it made sense. This is a working-class town, every bit as much as Detroit. The roughly 9,000 workers are well paid, but theyre not fancy. Theyre not the 0.1% found so often in Genevas diplomats, Zurichs bankers and on the slopes of Gstaad, Klosters and Zermatt. 
No, La Chaux-de-Fonds is a different kind of Switzerland. Its the type of place that gave birth to the monied juggernaut by working hard and making things. 
Step into a bar like the convivial, casual LEntre Deux or the local, Swiss-style Bière Shop, and youll find sneaker- and Birkenstock-wearing locals ordering beer and the local vin jaune dArbois  aged precisely six years and three months and tasting heavily of walnut  instead of high-end cocktails. In the shop attached to the Bière Shop, I bought a small bottle of absinthe  the Jura is where much of Europes wormwood is grown  and before I even got back to my table with it, I ran into the guy who made it at his home distillery on the outskirts of town. 
When Buehler had taken me to see the shiny, new and abstract Chevrolet monument earlier that afternoon, an elderly woman sauntered over with her tiny, elderly dog and said she wasnt at all sure what to think of it. Conversation ensued, and it turned out both she and Buehler had been born in the rather large building behind us, which used to be the old lying-in hospital where Cendrars was also born. Its the type of exchange that reminded me, as much as the industry might evolve, this tucked-away little Swiss gem of a town probably hasnt changed much since Chevrolet was a boy.

			Hello,   
My husband just recently took over as conductor in Orchester Stäfa Ürikon and is looking to build up the orchestra, if you or anyone you know in the area plays a stringed instrument the orchestra is happy to welcome new players - we especially need violas and bass players but all instruments are welcome -- It is an amateur orchestra so you don't have to be a pro, just have the desire to make music together!    
The rehearsals are on every Tuesday 20:00-22:00 and there will be two concerts per season around Golden Coast area. You don't have to speak German since my husband speaks fluent English just in case anyone is wondering. The members are very welcoming so don't be shy and try it out!   
PM me or contact the orchestra directly if you or anyone you know may be interested....

			I've got a little online clothes store. I ship within all of Switzerland via A Post (so you get the stuff in 2 days max after we dispatch them) and depending on weight, most parcels' shipping charges are less than 2 CHF (we also ship from within Switzerland so there are no customs charges for you). Since we've just opened and I like all of you guys, I'm offering free shipping to EF members for all orders shipped within Switzerland by means of the following coupon code: 5d58ca10f5 . Just type the code during checkout and redeem your free shipping!   
There are only 10 free shipping coupons available so use them quickly before someone else does!   
The shop is at:

			Hello,   
I wanted a herbal supplement which was overpriced here (X3) and I ordered it from Amazon.fr. The total value of the transaction is around 25eur. There wasn't any problem in placing the order (I don't know if on Monday the seller can reject it based on the fact I'm in Switzerland) I was wondering if it's just a matter of luck to receive products from France or whether I should be fine (and not fined! ^_^'). Sorry for the repetition of info you might have written already, but I didn't find a definitive answer in the searches I have tried.   
Thanks a lot and have a great sunny, but windy, week end

			To be honest, the jump from your very good salary in Munich to a good salary in Zurich doesn't seem as drastic as it should be. The net salary/housing cost ratio seems to be actually higher in Zurich (more purchase power given the higher net salary) than Munich. This was based on my particular job/apartment search so I was comparing a net salary in Munich vs. a net salary in Zurich for my particular job (mileage will vary of course) and found that I would have to pay roughly 25% of my combined family salary on rent in Zurich, compared to roughly 33% in Munich.     
For everything else, though, food, clothing, services (e.g., bike, car repair) and all the other things we forget about when budgeting, the net salary/purchase price ratio will be way higher in Munich.    
Add to this the cost of child care in Zurich vs. (assuming public) child care in Munich, and your Munich situation starts to look more attractive...

Personally that   how I'd usually dress for a wedding (with or without hat, depending.... and I mean a proper hat, not those stupid flying saucer things) but that's to some extent a generational thing.   
So the trick really is not to over or under do it; I once saw the bride's   turn up in black trousers, red jumper and a tatty ski jacket, she looked like she'd been gardening and simply couldn't be bothered to change!   
Audrey Hepburn rather than Bette Midler, will that do?!   
OP; Make sure you feel comfortable and self-assured in what you're wearing, and that included underwear.... nothing that's going to pinch, ride up/down or be difficult to wriggle out of in the loo!

I have had a total medical, endrocrine, nutritional, etc workup and no Dr. can figure out the problem.   I've also tried herbal remedies and over the counter medications.  No help.   
So, I thought maybe I'd try lasers, but I can't find any here in Zurich.    
If anyone does happen to  know of any MedSpas or Laser treatment centers, I'd love to know.     
Thanks again.

The collectors from the charity drive by with small trucks to collect the bags. 
If, in the evening, your bag is still there, you can call a number that is marked on the bag itself.

			Hi all,   
I have had the great fortune to find a complete beginners painting and drawing class specifically run for English speakers at the migros klubschule in Basel. 
It is currently run Monday mornings 9 to 11.50 also on a wed pm from 3 to 4.50   
Just wanted to mention it as its very relaxing, no pressure and the lovely Scottish lady who runs it is very encouraging and its all in English! 
I was a little intimidated at first as I hadn't picked up a paint brush since school, but after the first lesson I felt right at home. 
So if anyone would like to uncover their inner artist and meet some fellow expats this is a great group. 
Just thought I would share it , if anyone is tempted and wants to know more just ask, I have just signed up for the third time.

			Whatever you do, do NOT pay thru any agency, or any other kind of 3rd  party. Coop is your contract partner, and the Coop account is where your  money is due, therefor that is where you want to send the money  exclusively. Exactly the same account you used to pay your monthly 24.90  to, unless of course Coop provided new payment instructions EXPLICITYLY  saying they CHANGED from this to that.   
Maybe that's being  paranoid, but by using any 3rd party you may  implicitly be accepting their services, and thus become liable to pay  for whatever they want to charge for their  efforts. What's more, they may deduct what they consider theirs from  what you pay, and only transfer the remainder forward. There's no need  at all to take that risk.   
The collecting agencys' costs are not yours to pay, it's the law:   (SchKG is pronounced ""ScheKaGe"", using german pronounciation rules).   
As for what you owe: 
Your  ordinary dues from the old contract is, it seems, 8x24.90 (perhaps  9x24.90). I use ""old contract"" because you probably entered into a new  one by requesting a change to 14.90, which presumably comes with a new  earliest-cancellation date of its own.   
Sorry to say so, but the  whole mess appears to be your fault only, you could easily have paid a  lump sum for the remaining 8 or whatever months when you left and  cancelled at the same time. Offer to pay the 8x24.90 (or 9x, whichever  you  are actually due on your old contract) within one week (or whatever  time frame is doable for you), and be done  with it. As for the 500CHF fine - try to avoid that, considering your  monthly due this kind of fee may  well be considered usurious. Remember to mention that you could simply  not pay, and no, you're not going to pay for any kind of collecting  costs (see above, be sure to mention law name and paragraph number), so even  without the fine they may end up with more cash in hand than what may be  left once the collecting agency has been paid.   
Whatever the sum  you agree upon,  make sure it says ""per saldo aller Ansprüche bis  und mit Vertragsende"" (net of all claims up to and including termination  of the contract) in the confirmation mail. And also make sure the recipient  will receive what he's owed, as there will be additional costs for  the international transfer so your payment will actually be  somewhat higher.   
Edit: 
Your contracts are probably auto-extending unless explicitly cancelled. Unless you reach an agreement soon (within a week or two, which seems highly unlikely) you want to make sure to explicitly cancel your contract ""auf den nächsten vertraglichen Kündigungstermin"".

			If you still have family in Canada, don't forget the cost of the required pilgrimage back home.   
(We used to get away with only 4 times a year, but now it's every two weeks. Takes rather a large bite out of our discretionary spending...)   
But even if you don't need to head back home regularily, think about holiday travel. Travel is part of the Swiss psyche - and a large part of many Swiss household budgets.

It  seems that the law applicable at the time and place of the marriage  also is the law that (typically?) rules separation, divorce and  inheritance. The situation may be comparable in that respect to a  company that, in their terms & conditions, says  ""Gerichtsstand ist Zürich"" or some such, which determines the law  applicable when differencies arise. Presumably such a clause is missing in your marital contract so default procedures apply.   
For instance, german courts in some cases even    law,  especially with respect to marriage/divorce and inheritance (generally,  cases governed by civil law). I would  assume that swiss courts are not too far from practice that as both are subject  to basically the same international law (albeit to perhaps differing  degrees).   
Excerpt from an  : 
Broad translation of the excerpt below: 
""Local  law does not in and of itself take  precedence over  foreign law as all national laws are in and of themselves equal (of  equal importance, weight). Instead, the deciding factor is, which law is  the family or most affected person most closely related to."". By  signing the petition you probably accepted  to use indian law, provided you actually had a choice in the first  place (I think together with your wife you did).   
""Ausgangspunkt  des IPR [Internationales PrivatRecht] ist die Gleichwertigkeit aller  staatlichen Rechtsordnungen; das eigene materielle Privatrecht des zur  Entscheidung zuständigen Gerichts (sog. materielle lex fori) hat in  einem ersten Rechtsfindungsvorgang (bei der kollisionsrechtlichen Frage:  Welche staatliche Rechtsordnung ist auf das familienrechtliche  Verhältnis, wie Ehe, Kindesverhältnis, Güterrecht usw. anwendbar?)  keinen Vorrang. Für die Anwendung des einen oder anderen staatlichen  Familienrechts durch das zuständige schweizerische Gericht ist primär  der Gesichtspunkt, zu welcher staatlichen Rechtsordnung die betroffene  familiäre Gemeinschaft oder die hauptsächlich betroffene Person die  engste Beziehung hat, massgeblich.""

we are in the process of selling our house in the Bay Area and move to Zuerich this July.  
Anyone used a relocation company that you would recommend to us?   
Also, we will soon be in the process of selling lots of items. If you are moving to the Bay Area, send me an email. We are not able to bring everything to Switzerland since we are moving from a house into an apartment.

			Reading your experience, it soothes my wounds. I moved here about 9 months ago. Although being experienced living in different cultures for more than 10 years now, after I moved here I got overwhelmed with being lonely and stressed so much that I haven't socialized at all after several trials. I don't understand why people are not open to communicate in English, even when I am stupidly brave enough to try speaking swiss german  :P

			A service is more than just an oil and filter change - but you knew that, didn't you?    
A ""proper"" service will also inspect: 
- CV joints 
- Steering 
- Wheels and Tyres 
- Suspension components - including bushes and tie rods 
- Seals, clips, hoses and pipes 
- Brakes - including discs, pads, sensors, pipes and hoses 
- Transmission and differential oil 
- Wipers 
- All fluids 
- Spark plugs 
- Fault reading   
A simple BMW service (main dealer) was 450chf - adding 200chf for a brake fluid change - so 2 hours of work for the service + parts. And 1 hour for the brakes + parts   
High quality oil will cost 30chf per litre with little effort - and is sold in 1l amounts - and you'll need between 4-8 depending on engine and cylinders.

			Hello!  We are a family from CA and are visiting Lucerne/Luzern in June.  We have a five year old daughter and are in need of a sitter for a few nights (June 10th, 12th, and 13th).  Preferably someone who speaks a little English! I thought this forum may be a good place to start.  If anyone knows of a sitter in the area and is willing to pass on our info, we'd appreciate it!     
We have had great experiences with sitter services in the US, UK, Austria, and Mexico, but I can't seem to find a reasonable one in Switzerland.  The hotel can coordinate a sitter but for 30CHF.  We were planning on 20 CHF.  She's five.  She'll be asleep for most of the evening!   
Thank you in advance!   
Best, 
Lisa

			If the value of goods PLUS postage charge is less than CHF62,50, then they shouldn't attract charges.   
For gifts, this rises to CHF100,00   
However, personal experience has shown that Swiss customs are a law unto themselves, and can't check every single parcel. 
Some, over value, can slip through, and (although I can't be 100% certain), I have a faint recollection that I once had to pay a small charge on a low value item.   
The key is labelling details - ""gift"", description of contents and realistic estimated value (there was a time when 'no commercial value' would have sufficed, but I think not anymore).   
However, immaterial of possible custom charges, I am not sure how you stand, sending foodstuffs and alcohol in the post.

			Hi!  
Good luck on your move! It's good you're so prepared!   
The best thing to do is join internations.org. You sign up (it's free) and join the St Gallen community. You will then be invited to monthly events, which bring around 50+ people from all over the world of different ages, which is a god send because I found it so hard to meet younger people my age (23). People communicate in English, unless they meet others who speak the same language! It feels very comfortable networking and is always great fun!   
Also, if you wanna study German I recommend AIDA women's school, it's cheaper and you can meet lots of women from different places! They also host events occasionally (baking, easter egg painting for kids etc.).

Or.... he buys an item worth 500 in Germany and tells them he's going to export it. So they ship the item with the green form. He collects the item, and fills in his part of the green form and gets it stamped on the German side of customs. He declares it at the Swiss border and pays 8% tax on 500-German MWST. He then send the complete green form to the supplier who refunds the money on his credit card.   
OK - not all will offer this service, but it's technically possible isn't it?   
I did recently get stuff delivered to a German address and just paid the tax on the customs side without reclaiming the German MWST. It was still a lot cheaper and quicker than getting the stuff in Switzerland!

    yes - this was the scenario that I was dreading.  Spending hundreds on a lawyer to have them capitulate at the last moment, leaving me out of pocket.  It's really a low-risk proposition for them to keep stonewalling until they can do so no more.   
   What I have done is to contact the company again, using the links provided by the posters here, and point out my rights.   
(Thanks go out to to Destiny and Mark for the URLs)   
  I've told them that I won't accept sending the device to the manufacturer for a warranty repair.   
   What I will accept is: 
(a) Cash refund 
(b) New, replacement set 
(c) Repair supervised by their company with a replacement set/cash back if the repair is not done to my satisfaction within two weeks.     
   I think I'm being more than fair here,  let's see what they come back with.   
   If they still insist that this is still not their problem, I'm inclined to go the legal route anyway.  Since their current 'offer' is that I just apply for a warranty repair myself, I have nothing to lose in terms of getting the set fixed as I can make a warranty claim any time I like.

			Hey everybody!!!! 
It´s so cute to read all these confortable posts. It´s really touched me, makes me cry and makes me believe in this world, even if the distance, we can count on people in a delicate moment. When I was there, I thought every posted word in here, I swear, in my silence among people in there. 
I felt too much the my mom loss when she was in front of her death son in the first time, in this morning, in the bural. God! It was so hard to see it: the pain of a mother when she lost her son!!!     
Thank soooo  mmuuuuucchhh everybody in here.

			To be fair, once we finally got hold of the right person and insisted that a credit note wasn't acceptable they finally agreed to collect the sofabed and refund us.     
Of course they blamed the supplier for the quality issues - seems to be the normal response these days, may as well buy directly online if the shop is effectively just buying from a catalogue themselves...     
Overall their customer service could have been a lot more responsive and less painful, but pretty much average for this sort of company. Same with the product - overpriced for the build quality, looks good in the showroom.

			Leather goods bought in Spain are often made from cheap imported camel hide from Morocco, across the water.   
If it smells of camel poop, then you can probably guess which part of the beast the hide came from ..... looks like you're lumbered; - just take care if you use it on a visit to a zoo ..... you could well attract unwelcome attention.

			You can take ""special"" food and drinks for infants and toddlers through security - can't find an age limit anywhere though.   
It is probably best if you put it into the bottle you will give it to your child in, or a collection of smaller containers rather than the big-sized cartons you get from the supermarket.   
You just have to tell the person at security what it's for and they will look at how much you have and how long you are travelling for.....contrary to popular belief they won't make you drink it, but may take it away for special screening (which consists of putting the bottle into a little box and pressing a button..no idea what it does!).

It likely contains a clause that says major changes need to be approved and also that you need to put things back to the way they were when you move out.   
That being said, you can liven up the place without painting. Fabric prints, wall hangings, nice window treatments and pictures can help.

982	03.06.2008, 14:17	Senior Member	Thanked 168 Times in 90 Posts	Location: Menzingen	"    I really had to think about this!   I couldn't remember! 
I don't think people do. Whereas a tin which contained food needs to be washed out to stop the 'bits in the bottom' going mouldy and smell, (the paper on the tin comes off fairly easily at the same time), wine and beer bottles are usually completely emptied! I rinse mine out but I'm not sure that everyone does even that. The fluid will evaporate anyway. What IS important though, is that the metal ring which screwed topped wine bottles have left round their neck, should be taken off. (Do it at home; I broke a fingernail once, trying to get it off before I dropped the bottle in the container).  
Hope you are settling in OK and not finding all the rules and regulations too irksame.

Really enjoy it. It's a decent amateur orchestra, playing symphonic orchestral music, is open to everyone and we play acouple of concerts in and around Zurich, twice a year. Rehearsals are Monday evenings, 19.45  21.45 in the KV Business School at Escher-Wyss-Platz. Rehearsal language is Hochdeutsch, but it needn't be an issue if your German isnot so good (nay non-existent)  where there's a will, there's a way . We're currently on the lookout for more support in all string registers (particularly violas and basses, but also violins/cellos also welcome), as well as brass and a 1st bassoonist (the rest of the woodwind seats are currently occupied).     The orchestra is a really friendly bunch of people who don't take themselves too seriously, the majority of whom don't work in musical circles but enjoy coming together once a week to make music. If you're interested, check out the website (http://www.okvz.ch/index.php/home_en.html) and you can send a mail on the ""Join us"" page. Alternatively you can PM me for more information.

			Hello, all:   
I'm the pastor of a French-speaking church in Lausanne, and I'm seeking musicians to play 1-2 times a month for our Sunday morning service.  Musicians would accompany approx. 6-8 congregational hymns and select pieces from their own repertoire for the prelude, interlude, postlude, and on certain Sundays communion.  Pianists and organists are particularly sought, but any musician capable of accompanying congregational song is warmly welcomed.   
The community at this moment is small and intimate.  They are ""traditional"" in style and very much appreciate classical music.  There are a number of talented musicians and ensembles who use the space for rehearsals and who participate occasionally on Sunday morning, and there's beginning to be a really nice collaborative atmosphere in the building (concerts, joint services with other communities, special musical services, etc.).     
I would like to be able to offer financial compensation, but it is not possible at this time.  What we can offer is this: 1) the use of a grand piano and/or organ for practice purposes, 2) the opportunity to network with other friendly musicians (myself included), and 3) the welcome and encouragement of a church community that finds spiritual nourishment in the arts.  If this interests you, then I look forward to speaking with you soon.     
All good wishes!

			Swiss ovens tend to use three-phase (440V), but it should be easy enough to wire a single-phase oven to a single one of the phases. You just need to be aware of this, though.   
Traditionally, Swiss kitchens were fitted for 55cm wide devices (all types of device, including ovens). So you should check the gap sizes.

			If you can't find a white space or other free space. Then the visitor parking ticket only costs 10 CHF per day or 6CHF per half day. YOu can get them from the green tram ticket machines and they are valid in blu parking spot (either for the local area, or the whole Basel stadt - I forget). 
Sundays are free anyway. If they arrive after 1730 on Thursday then Thursday will be free, though they will need the blue disk if before 1900.       .

For example, if the condition of the item is not as described. It is very subjective, and in fact they really don't need a reason.    
If this is not the case,then unfortunately you have to re-advertise the item. Ricardo will refund the original costs charged to you for the incompleted transaction.   
Are you aware that it costs chf 200 to initiate a Betreibung? and you need solid proof. Not sure winning a Ricardo auction would warrant this.

			Hi all,   
I'm buying  a new car soon (my first in Switzerland). I would like to know all expected paperwork and costs I will have: 
 - How is the process of registration? 
 - Which taxes I have to pay (when buying and after each year)? 
 - Insurance - which are mandatory? 
 - Year maintenance/review (MKT)?   
Thanks for your help

But I do think it was the right place and time to make a point about said irony.  
Otherwise, let's just talk about chocolate. We agree that belgian pralines are better than the Swiss ones.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Where to buy a double stroller for twins?	lazylion	Posts: 123

			If you like old postcards....   
The app Swiss Postcard unveils old postcards of over 1,000 Swiss municipalities of the early twentieth century in nearly all cantons. It was developed on behalf of the Swiss Conference of Cantonal libraries (CSBC).    
Cantonal libraries and the Swiss National Library have thousands of postcards, indicates the CSBC in a statement Thursday. The Swiss Postcard application presents for the first time an excerpt from the rich collections that generally remain in the shadow of books and electronic media.    
The app is available for smartphones and tablets running iOS and Android. It can be downloaded for free from the usual platforms.      translated with google.     
You can add to that the website   who has 6000 old postcards from Geneva area.      "	null	null	null	Old Swiss Postcards	guest	null

			The Police does not organize auctions. Bikes that aren't collected by the owners within 90 days from the ""Velosammelstelle"" are given to the ""Ganthaus"" (Auctionhouse)...if there are enough.   
Next Gant (Auction) is on March 18, 2015. 
Information can be found here:     
You can have a look at the things offered on the day of the auction from 9 to 9.55 am. They sell movables, vehicles and receivables. Check the site regularly as they will update what will be auctioned.

			Hi,   
I'm about to move to Switzerland this year (Basel area). Last year I started gliding training in local flying club in my home country & I would like to continue flying also abroad. My experience isn't really impressive although I achieved the level on which I'm allowed to fly solo in aerodrome circuit (after winch launch).   
Could you recommend any gliding clubs in Basel area or Germany with reasonable fees and within acceptable distance from the city?

Exactly my thoughts at the time of ""chef come running""!  hahahaa     
And it was a smoking restaurant!!!!!  Most of the table were slurping drinks and smoking.     
Maybe they keep a ""running paella""? ... just keep topping up the rice ... and re-arranging the scant portions of seafood on top?  Could be. 
At least it was brought out from the kitchen to us, and looked ""new"".     
Was a really strange experience, I must say.  I felt sorry for the husband who paid the bill in the end - I think more alcohol was consumed than food eaten - AND he`d paid everone`s train fare/taxis so they could relax and enjoy the afternoon of eating/drinking.

			And if its the case that is cracked, there is always eBay and Ricardo. I managed to knock a corner off the cover of the light switch in my basement and on closer inspection it looked like 1950s bakelite. I could have fitted something modern but that would have required fiddling around with the electrics and drilling into the wall (which is difficult when the electricity is switched off) and also I didn't know how the landlord might react if ever he noticed the modern switch. It took to me 10 minutes on Ricardo and 50 Rappen plus postage later and I had a fitting pre-loved cover that looked identical and fitted the existing switch perfectly and nobody was any the wiser.

			Regarding the retail versions of the Westin Hotel or Sofitel Hotel beds, I'm having a devil of a time finding information on ordering from Europe and then having it delivered into Switzerland.     
So far, what I'm seeing -- and this may just be a need for more coffee -- is an option to order in the States and then ship the whole lot Internationally.   
But there must be an offshoot of these Hotels based at least somewhere in Europe that I can order from and will be slightly less expensive and time consuming than having it shipped from the States, yes?   
Any thoughts would be helpful.   :-)

			I go to the Migros Fitness unit in Heuwaage for a few years now and had all sorts of experiences with classes in English.   
The staff is, in general, very mixed and willing to help you in English. For classes, it mostly depends on what the instructor feels like doing. I took some spinning classes where she held the whole lesson both in German and English, without the need for me to ask for extra help. For some TRX ones, however, the instructor kept speaking German the whole time and would approach me in English whenever she noticed something was off or that I looked really stupid. Anyway, you pick it up really quickly.   
Next to food - survival mode! - body parts, breathing patterns and movements are where I have the highest German vocabulary!

			While the 100 CHF is the stated exclusion amount for gifts excluding postage, we have sometimes been charged duties when the value of the items sent is under 100 CHF but the postage puts the total value over.  We've also had times when the total value (items+postage) is under 100 CHF and they charge then as well -- perhaps the Customs office didn't believe the declared value, though they did not open the box, or felt we should have bought it in Switzerland.   
It's just one of those mysteries whether or not you will get taxed, and in discussing with our Swiss neighbor she seconded this.

But it could definitely be an issue if they get back into the top division.   
The traffic noise is not related to the football though - Premier Mars and Pierre-à-Mazel between them make up the main east-west route through town for all local traffic, so lots of buses, delivery lorries and generally people going from place to place. Through traffic is in tunnels under the town centre so not a problem.

You'll be fine with a motorcycle when you arrive in May and then you can start looking for a car once you get here. You wouldn't want to be riding a motorcycle from Neuchâtel to La Chaux de Fonds in winter that's for sure.  
Make sure you have all the paperwork for the import of the motorcycle if you do decide to bring it. As long as you've owned it for six months or more you can import it tax free as part if your move. 
It's probably a good idea to establish yourself down near the lake somewhere, there's a better chance of you girlfriend getting a job for one and there is much more to do than there would be living up in t'Chaux.   
As others have pointed out it is quite hard to do anything before you move over here but you should start flat hunting fairly soon. You can use your job contract or a letter from your employer until you get your actual permit.   
Do the company not offer you some sort of temporary accommodation for the first few weeks? 
End of June is one of the official moving dates so there are often more flats available at that time. ( end of March is another but that's probably too early for you).

			Hello Galatea,   
You have made a couple of points i want to comment on: 
- bps - like i said is only needed if i want to work in uk but it wad confusing since zurich university asked for an accredited decree in uk. I needed to find out which kind of accreditation they need 
- the second point about them not allowing to transfer credits because they want to make sure your are doing core subjects is not correct.  
The bachelor with bps accreditation requires you to do 180 in psychology. 
The bachelor in psychology and computer science does not give you bps accreditation because it is still trying to obtain accreditation. 
In this case i would study: 
First year 30 cs and 30 psy 
Second year 30 cs and 30 psy 
Third year 30cs and 30 psy   
If i transfer all 90 cs, i would have left 90 in psychology. That means i wouldnt miss any core modules and it would be enough for a masters at zurich university since a bachelor there can be monostudy but also have a major and a minor.   
The reason that is not possible is because they can only transfer all the credits for level 1 and then some level 2. that wozldnt work because bps requires that you study your modules in a certain order. Thats why i chose the non bos accredited open degree.   
Of course, i will know for sure when i apply for the masters at zurich uni.   
I want to work as a clinical psychologyst in my own practice and for that i need a masters and a further education program. 
I am not sure that a bachelor is that important. I just need to get into the masters program.

Back to problem in hand, burn them, collect the ashes and add them to a jar labelled ""Granddad""!! Which brings me neatly onto:     
Combine a history lesson with a tragic moment in your child's life. When a small pet dies (goldfish, hamster, small dog) head to the toy store and buy a small wooden boat. Take the boat, the passed pet and half a litre of unleaded down to the lake. Place the ex-pet on the boat, marinade in 95 octane, recant a prayer in Norwegian/Danish/Swedish, set light to the boat and push it out onto the lake. Then explain to your child (and the police) that the pet pining for fjords is taking its final trip to Valhalla.

If they did it once or twice it would probably make people think twice about 'faking it' for a while at least.     
Our GP doesn't charge for issuing a medical certificate as I guess it's considered part of the consultation fee but when my OH needed an extension to his certificate recently ( should have taken doc's advice and had the whole week off in the first place) there was a fee added to the bill ( a 5 min consultation fee) which was reimbursed by the insurance as it was on the same bill as the original consultation.

There you will usually find international institutions, which can administer the test at a cost. For my university, I would have had to go to Geneva and pay roughly 270 CHF for one exam.

			I was in Zurich last November and used a laundromat which is not listed in the posts above.   
Google Street View link:       
If you zoom in, you will see the words Selbstbedienungs-Waschsalon (Self Service Wash Salon) on the window -- that's the place.   
It's on the line for tram #9, near the Goldbrunnenplatz stop.   
Prices were similar to what jleh posted.  This one was not that great -- not all of the machines were in working condition, there was no soap available for purchase (and nowhere near that I could find to buy some -- I borrowed some from another customer) and I ran out of change before my clothes were dry so I ended up taking a bag of damp clothes back to my hotel -- OK, that last one was my fault.   
I'm going back in October so I will try one of the others that jleh posted -- thank you for the informative post!

But if it's a vehicle and he is selling on consignment for a customer then no VAT is due and thus he won't be able to deduct it from the price.    
At least that is the case for other EU countries. I'd imagine it's the same for Italy.

			Wow - thanks for all the suggestions.    
Want we want to do is replace all the handles on the patio doors and on the windows, with lockable ones (all though the windows and doors lock solidly when shut - bolts top and bottom - the handles themselves don't have keys). But some of the wooden framed windows are looking a bit in need of replacement - which isn't surprising with them being ~20 years old.    
We might also be getting a cat or two, so a new door with a cat flap might be on the cards.

			Guiding law is the  (ZGB), articles 60 and following. A Verein is free to rule for itself as its members decide so long as it's not in contradiction with the ZGB. Additional Kantonal law may apply, don't know.   
Minimum membership is two (better three to avoid tie-ups), statutes are mandatory. If it's not-for-profit it gets able to legally act by the ""Gründungsversammlung"" (constituting assembly?) accepting the statutes. If it's for-profit, additionally an entry in the Handelsregister is required.   
When living in Zurich city I was club treasurer for 5 years (annual budget 20-25k, not counting public tournaments). We also worked with the Jugendsportamt by sending trainers to the annual school sports camp in Fiesch. AFAIR we never did any paperwork regarding any kind of registration.

In Europe the prices aren't so different (especially taking into consideration travel, and lets be 100% honnest for the reason you are going to Milan/Madrid; it's not sight seeing) 
Where the difference can occur is in VAT by re-claiming VAT when you leave and ""forgetting"" to pay the Swiss VAT, however their is a risk to this if you are caught. 
Also these type of shops tend only to offer about 10% of the VAT back (around 20% in Europe) as rest is required for administration by Global Blue.  
(Why it costs the same percentage to do exactly the same work on a 300 item as opopsed to a 30'000 item is beyond me) 
By buying in Europe you'll save about 10-12% (take in to consideration travel costs and foreign exchange costs and credt card charges) and technically you pay 8% Swiss VAT 
So big saving of 2%

			I did not look at the first linked list of OP.  
I blindly assumed that he meant the normal pharmaceutical drug  grades A-D (uppercase letters). (As listet in SR 812.212.21  )   
Wheras the list linked by OP   no English aviable) deals with narcotics, divided in catogory a-g (lowercase letters)    
The most likely source of this list is the Yellow list from the INCB    
The Swiss definition of a to g can be found in   (no English version) which is the legal base for SR 812.121.11. And SR 812.12.1 (  linked by OP) is the legal base for SR 812.121.1 and SR 812.121.11.   
Now, the letters a to g mean:      Thus, d means ""Forbidden, controlled substances""

Prior to that one needs to look at the various ports, or at ship's manifests, etc.

			We have fixed solar panels (this summer)  ostensibly for heating the pool but we are told that even in these northern climes, there will be excess capacity which can be directed towards the household hot water system throughout the year.   
There were federal subsidies, cantonal subsidies and subsidy from the town meaning that the price became rather reasonable and from the forward calculations (I work for an environmental consultancy so they modelled some pretty detailed figures for me) we anticipate the system paying for itself within 10 years.  System lifespan is 20 plus.

but even in the ski possition, while leaning forward the boot feels uncomfortably too small at the front.   
when I tried to tighted the upper clips more my foot started to get cold as the blood circulation was probably a bit cut off..

			Thanks for all the responses, everyone. Seriously, I was stoked to see so many replies. I appreciate it like crazy.   
You guys are very right. Credibility is extremely important for what we're trying to do. CH_Me hit the nail on the head about the 'alarm bells' thing. Despite not offering a physical product (thank you for clarifying it for everyone, grumpygrapefruit), having a physical address on our 'About Us' page helps build trust and gives us a 'face' to our readers. Whenever we try to offer help through an article, people are more apt to take what we say seriously; that we are who we say we are. It's about transparency and being yourself. It's hard to do that with the anonymity of the internet.   
That being said, the best we can do right now without gambling with our home address (and personal safety) is to use a P.O. box. Mrs. Doolittle, once we're more established it won't be a problem to get a paid or business P.O. box through the Post. Thank you for your suggestions though - this is the first time I even heard about Opendi, so you taught me something new    
But yeah. Since we're only starting out, we don't have the money to spend on something that has free alternatives. Thankfully my husband is a talented web developer so we didn't need to spend as much as we might have for the site design, but there's still hosting and a myriad of other little fees that really stack up. Not to mention the investment in additional photography equipment since that's going to be one of our focuses (we live in Switzerland, it'd be some kind of crime against humanity to have a lifestyle blog and not to share the beautiful scenery with the world, haha).   
Back to the credibility thing. That's probably the only reason why we're not going to go with Sbrinz's suggestion (despite it being an awesome one. Thank you by the way, I hadn't noticed that option before you mentioned it). The Postlagernd would work perfect for the technical requirements (to appease the spam laws, AdSense, and SEO I think), but when it comes to real people and not just bots looking at that address, it's one step less personal than even a P.O. box.   
I think I'm going to update the OP to include all the options we talked about in case others have this problem later on. I love how helpful this community is, and before I even made this thread I looked up similar topics here to see if they could help. But they didn't quite satisfy what I was looking for. EDIT: Actually, no I'm not because the edit option isn't available on the OP. Ah well, I think this thread is still a treasure trove of options for anyone that might need something similar!   
So for now, I think we're going to stick with the digital P.O. box with the Post. Should that backfire on us and end up more expensive than just shelling out the 250 for a local box, I'll surely let you all know :P Thanks again, everyone.

			The easiest way for you to come study abroad is for a higher education degree, ie-masters or PhD.  The best way to do this is to look on the ETHZ website (or whatever universities you are interested in), find the professors that are doing research that interests you, and then contact them if they have positions available.  They post these positions just like job openings, and they treat them like that as well (with interviews and such).  You can also look at some of the national lab type places (like the Paul Scherrer Institut) because a significant number of the scientists employed have joint appointments as professors at ETH or other technical universities in Switzerland.  Thus, they are always looking for PhD/Masters students to come in and do research.     
As an additional bonus, if you come in for a higher education degree in a technical field, they will pay you to be here (especially at the PhD level), whereas if you come in for a second bachelors, you will have to fund that yourself.   
Good luck!

			First things first: 
Land Rover what? IE Year, model? 
Full description of the fault? IE what actually happens? 
Is it covered by warranty? 
Land Rover gararge - is that a dealer? Or specialist?   
14 days but a bill of 1200chf would suggest very little labour but long lead times of parts.   
Intermittent electrical problems are bitch to locate, identify and fix.

			In case anyone was curious, I finally snagged my buddy his Tali via ebay. And I got a massively great deal on her as well. I just had to have her mailed first to a friend in the States since the seller refused to ship directly to Europe (*grumbles*).   
In any case, despite not leading directly to a purchase, the advice you guys gave (in this thread and the PMs I received) was much appreciated and very helpful. Thank you again so much. I'm greatly looking forward to visiting some of these shops (which I wouldn't have known of if not for you fellas) in the future.

			Gipfeli for an Apero? maybe not as a lot of people consider it a ""morning"" food. Sandwiches are always a good option but if you have a speciality finger food from home that is always well received, home made dips (hummus, tomatoe salsa ect) is another one.

For more mid price guitars you can try ""pro music"" in Sihlfeldstrasse near the locherhut tram stop (trams 2/3). They have a good selection of electric guitars for all styles of music.   
The ""bass centre"" in Alstetten has started to stock more guitars but has a limited choice, I think is worth a visit.   
Personally I would avoid Music Hug (Expensive and not a good selection), Music Kuhn (Very limited selection) and Central Music (not much to choose from).

			Not sure Mary would have agreed- nor all those who were tortured or burnt at the stake for their 'Protestant' religion. Others seem to agree with the 'yay and nay':           That  Anglicanism is wholly ""protestant"" is an extremely simplistic assertion  and hinges on the meaning of the term itself. However, so too is the  contention among some that the term ""protestant"" doesn't apply to  Anglicanism in even the slightest sense. If asked if we Anglicans are  Protestant or Catholic some will say: ""We are Catholic, but not Roman-- .""  This is simplistic and historically erroneous, and any layperson with  an interest in reading would soon find very Catholic sounding Churchmen  of the 16th and 17th centuries embracing the term Protestant.   What to make of it then?      
  If we are using today's terminology perhaps ""Protestant"" isn't wholly  accurate, but neither would be the use of the term ""Catholic,"" for in  today's use of the term this means Roman. Many Anglicans are happy to  explain the historic and correct use of the term ""Catholic"" but do not  wish to do so with the term ""Protestant."" This is a selective use of  logic--if the historic usage of one term is explained the other term  ought to be likewise explained. ""You see, you misunderstand the term  Catholic dear friend. . ."" The follow up should be they also  misunderstand the historic use of the term Protestant. However, it needs  to be noted that many Anglicans today have become Latter-Day Puritans,  attempting to sweep the Anglican Church of any hint of ""Romanism"" (which  may mean choirs robed in surplices, a priest wearing a coloured stole,  or keeping the 1662 Prayer Book calendar of saints days): Many from this  group do indeed wish to deny any ""Catholic"" character or nature  existing within Anglicanism. This also is to deny history.      
 How do the Anglican divines use the terms? It is shocking to many that the terms are used  :  Protestant Catholic, Reformed Catholic, etc. Again, as I say so often  quoting Bishop Cosins: ""Protestant and Reformed according to the  principles of the ancient Catholic Church."" What does this mean? Well,  it should be clear to most. The English Reformation was built upon  removing erroneous beliefs and practices (the Mass not in the  vernacular, the Bible not in the vernacular, Purgatory, indulgences,  transubstantiation, doctrines about the excess merits of the saints,  etc). All needed to be stripped away--reformation was needed, and the  Church of England protested against the errors of the Roman Church.   
 To put it more concisely: ""At the Reformation the Church of England  became protestant in order to become more truly and perfectly Catholic.""  William Van Mildert, Bishop of Durham 1826-36.     
 Let me turn to the good Father Moss for a fuller explanation (from  ):   
 ""Remember, 'Catholic' means universal. Strictly speaking, only those  doctrines and practices are Catholic which have always been believed and  used in all parts of the Church. More loosely, the word is applied to  practices and traditions (such as the observance of Christmas Day or the  use of special dress by the clergy) which have a long continuous  history and are universally accepted, even though they do not go back to  apostolic times. The word also implies 'orthodoxy,' holding the right  faith and worshiping God in the right manner as required by the Church.""     
  In answer to the question: Is the Anglican Church Catholic or Protestant? Moss replies   
 ""Both; it is Catholic positively and Protestant negatively. It is  Catholic in its essential nature because it maintains the Catholic and  apostolic faith and order. It is Protestant,      (emphasis added), negatively because it rejects the papal claims to  supremacy, infallibility, and universal jurisdiction, and the decrees of  the Councils of Trent and the Vatican.""     
 When one is confused as to the use of these terms, they ought to be  clearly explained. Some will argue (as Moss actually does) that the term  Protestant has changed so much that we should omit its use all together  (many Lutherans argue likewise, in that the old use of the term  Protestant only referred to Anglicans, Lutherans, and Presbyterians; now  that it refers so loosely to almost anyone not Roman Catholic it has  become meaningless). However, the same could be said of the term  ""Catholic,"" since almost everyone means Roman when they say ""Catholic""  in the United States: Let's just stop using the word since it is so  easily misunderstood. In my opinion we should follow the language of the  Anglican divines, using both terms correctly and explaining the meaning  in a clear manner to avoid confusion.   
Is Anglicanism Protestant or Catholic? Ideally it is both, in the best sense of both terms.

			Additional clarification of point 6 of my answer - until you have filed your trade mark application in a particular country, there is a possibility that someone else could apply to register the mark, or a similar mark, in that country before you do. So it's best not to wait   long before registering it.

			You are pretty impatient. You post in the morning and expect everyone to have seen your post and answer by early afternoon!   
Anyway, I go every year, so here are my tips. Not the cheapest seats, as they are behind the stage. The 2nd price is OK, sideways on, or anything more expensive. The acts move in the middle anyway.   
Allow about one hour to get from the motorway to Malley by car, normally a 5 minute journey, or use public transport.   
Wrap up very warmly. Coat, scarf, gloves. A blanket for the knees is good too. 
Boots as feet get cold.

			The limiting factor is usually your shoes. 
I've occasionally (not in the last few years) walked home and it included crossing the Üetiliberg (~10km from Triemli). 
It took 2-2.5h, IIRC - but I was always close to getting blisters towards the end. 
I usually took the road that I normally take by bike and this includes a stretch that requires walking on the narrow road (to bike-lane, no pedestrian-lane, no street-lights). 
Not much traffic at those hours, but still annoying that they assume ""nobody would walk here anyway"". 
Taxi is around 60-ish from Triemli, IIRC. 
I never had the stomach to walk the Grat-Weg, I admit.

1158	24.09.2014, 23:54	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 18 Times in 7 Posts	Location: Vaud	"    Hi,   
Sorry for a slightly delayed reply - we were away for a few days. So not sure whether this will help for your situation or not.... but here goes....    
For us our main concern was that when I am away on business my young family are alone in the house. If my wife wakes up in the middle of the night and hears something downstairs what does she do.... go down stairs and confront them.... or call the police who will take probably far too long to arrive....   
So after some research it turns out that the commune where we live offer a hot line number for a local private security firm which you can call if you see / hear something suspicious (day or night) and they will send one of their patrols to your house. For our village the expected delay until the firm will arrive at your door following the call is circa 3 minutes!   
On top of which the cost is covered by our local taxes which we all pay - so ""free at the point of usage""... but you pay for it in the end....but let's not get distracted with that. Bottom line you can simply call the number whether you are a customer of the security firm or not, provided you live in the right commune they will come.... quickly.   
As far as I can gather this service started when the commune where we live got together with other communes in the area to pay for this service when the last local police station in the area closed down.   
It is important to note that the security firm will only come if they are called, so they don't keep an eye on your property if you are away etc. However for us if we get burgled when we're not in the house then we'll be upset of course but it's a part of life. From our point of view the main thing is the security for the family in the house (especially when I am away) so this service fits the bill for us.   
On the other part of your question about waking up when there is a fire, we have got several smoke alarms dotted around the house in relevant places.... of course it's not as good as a surveillance system but hopefully it should be enough - we're light sleepers!!   
So I guess now you need some more details; the security company doing all this is called SDS and you can find the list of communes which got together in offering this service (as well as the hotline number in case you hear something go bump in the night) using this link:       
You will see that the area ""terresainte"" is more or less between Versoix and Nyon so maybe it covers your commune too as you asked for things in the Geneva / Vaud areas - if it doesn't then it may be worth getting in touch with your local commune to see if they offer a similar service.   
Hope it was helpful!   
Cheers,   
DJD

			Looking for advice from the forum on a dentist payment that has gone awry.     
Background:   
I live in CH and visited dentist in Germany.  German dentist works with a third-party company to process billing and accounts receivable for Swiss patients.  This company sends me a bill with a German IBAN number, which I promptly pay via bank transfer via my Swiss bank account.     
The money successfully transfers, however, for some reason my name was completely garbled in the payment notification received by the German bank.  (note: my street address is still legible).  They say that they cannot reconcile the payment against my account with the dentist, and so they issue a return payment back to me...but for almost 80 CHF less than the original amount I paid.  The billing company claims that the difference is due to fees charged by the bank.     
They are now sending me unhappy letters in the mail requesting for me to make the payment again.  This feels fishy to me for a couple of reasons...     
1 - 80 CHF seems to be *awfully* steep for bank charges, even when you are reversing a payment.  The original bill was less than 300 CHF to begin with.     
2 - Not sure why they couldn't have taken a few minutes to look up my account using the street address instead of the name, and reconcile it.  This is more difficult, but not impossible.     
My inclination is to simply pay back exactly what was given to me, net of these ""bank charges""... but I also want to be sure that I don't end up creating a bigger problem in case the bank charges are actually legitimate.     
Anyone have any advice or similar experiences they could share?     
Thanks

			I think that as with many Bachelor level degrees, it is the transferable skills you accumulate while studying that make you attractive to an employer. In the ‘real’ world academic prowess is not as highly valued as experience. I remember an interview with the Civil Service, who were more interested in my previous customer service experience (working in a shop!) to how many academic papers I had written… :-S   
I know I did many hours voluntary in my undergrad years and got involved with research, even if that was sat imputing data, as this builds up the C.V., gave me access to the latest studies in my field of interest and numerous networking opportunities, which gave me the edge over students who just did their degree and nothing more. It also gives you more people to ask for good references!   
Clinical Psychology doctorate courses, more than any other fields of Psychology, will require candidates to have some kind of psychological assistant experience before considering them for the course. Students wanting to embark in this area are often advised to do voluntary work to build up this experience as they study. Else it would mean working for a year or so before applying for the doctorate.    
Being determined, focused, with a direct goal in sight and working over and above to get it, is usually the best way to secure the position of your dreams. I think that mature students have the advantage here over their younger counterparts and are more likely to be goal orientated having already experienced the real world.

			We flew Emirates to Australia December last year. Overall good but not without some problems. We were on the plane for 2hrs before pushing back due to ""a paperwork problem"", temperarure inside the plane was 30+ deg so I ended up with 2 kids having a meltdown due to a very late lunch, no drinks were offered but came out eventually after serveral requests. In their defence I don't think they anticipated so long a delay as every 15 mins was an announcement that we were only 5 min away from leaving. Anyway 1 hour into the flight my wife faints going to the toilet so they put her in the staff beds at the back of the plane for the rest of the trip to Dubai, monitored her and gave regular reports on her, we think the heat and lack of drinks was the cause.   
Stopover in Dubai was horrible, not a nice airport and I am in a world of pain for not checking on her myself but with 2 kids going mental it was not possible.   
On the flight to Australia before departing they came and did health checks and said they will move people after takeoff so she can laydown, so she had 4 seats and we were moved to a bulkhead seat so the boys had more room and the flight was full.   
So while we had some problem they really did try to help, we got our special meals and asked if I needed help with the boys. As it was a codeshare (we were ticketed Qantas) there was a large saving on ticket price.    
My parents (in their 70s) flew over with Swiss/Qantas, we prebooked their seats as my father has bad tintinitus but they moved them to the back of the plane, an hour into the flight he had problems with dizziness and could not hear a thing. No amount of requests could get any help so he walked forward to a vacant seat and was ordered to go back to his seat!!    
So you should be fine, for me on the next longhaul flight stopover time will be less important than where we stopover, Singapore is my favorite.

			what if  i used my friend name and address in Germany to send me the package as a gift to Switzerland. Since the stuff is below 100 chf ( i read that no need to pay tax if the gift is less than 100 chf,   ) will i still need to pay tax then??   
i tried to order it in amazon and in the end they give additional 10€ for Vorauszahlung der Importgebühr. Is this already the final price? do i still need to pay tax afterward? the stuff is only 65€ + 20€ delivery fee.   
thx

			The forests of the Jura are mixed, and mostly not pine but fir and epicea, which is very different from pine- in the Alps there are also millions of Arolla pines and also larch. If I remember rightly, from the top of my head, arolla pines have 5 needles per clump, whereas other pines have 3. Most châlets are made with arolla pines or larch as it is very long lasting and does not need any preseving treatment   Here we have a huge mixture of beech, ash, fir and epicea- but further down above lake Neuchâtel there are millions of walnut trees. Maple is quite rare- but poplar quit common along large rivers, and lakes- are you looking for white or black poplar?

			Just an update in case anyone else is interested in 3D printing. I visited the shop mentioned above in Kreis 4, and they mostly sell printers, rather than doing printing themselves. Shapeways looks good for initial prototypes, or items to be printed in small quantities, but is very expensive. The website   looks interesting, as you can upload your design, and they send it out for a quote to a number of local printers who are part of the network. This means you can also have your design printed and shipped locally within another country, if you should choose. It also provides a mechanism for more competitive pricing.

			I have exactly the same problem. I tryed steam cleaning, chemicals, bleach, baking soda, the works, no success. Then I took a screwdriver and scraped out a section.. it was black all the way down.. dirt, oil, and grunge had seeped into it (grout in low traffic areas are grey). So my solution is to piece-meal scrape out the really soiled grout and replace with new grout, tile by tile. I will only do a few regions that are really bad, mainly in the entryway and kitchen.    
Isn't there something like non-porous grout that resists staining?

(The bottle needs to be wrapped in alu foil and refrigerated to keep the oil from becoming rancid).   
Oh, and I just ordered Cod liver oil from  . Shipping is 2 pounds. I ordered from them because they use the first oil layer that comes off during production, not the second, which has lmuch ess vitamin A and D.

			An apartment is an apartment, irrespective if it is attached to a workplace. 
The rental price will be similar.   
I think the OP has found that offices/workplaces can be rented for only a few hundred francs a month and wants to know whether he can legally rent one of these and sleep in it. 
Aside from the practicalities of probably having no bath/shower or kitchen, I should think it's illegal as rooms allowed as sleeping quarters are strictly controlled at a Gemeinde level. 
A lot of new build apartments even have rooms that you are not allowed to sleep in and can only use for other purposes.   
Loads of people have houses and apartments and run a business out of one or more rooms. It's perfectly normal here.   
So basically, to sum up, there are no easy ways to drastically reduce your accommodation expenses (in Zurich).

			Dear fellow expats,    
Here I am again asking for you help! I am part of a group of students of linguistics who need to carry out a small survey for a master's paper and we have designed a short questionnaire (with 20 questions) to investigate various interpersonal language exchanges in daily life. The questionnaire will take only about 10 minutes of your time and your participation (which will be absolutely anonymous) will help us greatly. However, this time, we are looking for NATIVE SPEAKERS of English, only.    
Additionally, I would really appreciate if you could forward the survey link to other native speakers of English you might know. As in any research, the more, the better.    
Here is the link to the questionnaire:      
Thanks a lot in advance!

Personally, I do not think they are breaking any rules, and if you are not happy with their decision or the way they have treated you, then the best you can do is decide to go elsewhere.

			Look for music stores that cater to young students.  These are the most likely to be creative with rental purchases.  They often come across parents who buy pianos for their children, only to find out later the child has no interest nor propensity to play.  So they need a way to return the piano back.

			Thanks Meloncollie and all who replied! Yes, she is a US person, and in fact it is mine and my boss' job to make sure she gets a good deal (i.e. not just in terms of salary, but cost of living adjustment, etc. etc.) wherever she goes. She is not left alone, we do have a say in the negotiations. After all, we are ""losing her"" for a while, which is bad for our immediate needs, but great for the global team at large, so we want to ensure it is worth her while to go.   
We have people who handle the tax aspects on both sides of the equation, so she will be 100% taken care of there, as well as lawyers for the immigration stuff. She is single and in her 20s so no kids' school issues and the like. She was already aware of a lot of US tax implications of living abroad, and I made her read up on a lot more that she wasn't already aware of.    
I'd say the immigration bit is perhaps the most uncertain variable, since it is up to the government of wherever she wants to go to approve her visa, and it might impact where she is   to go  But we'll deal with it (i.e. if she does   get a visa for the place she wants to go to) if and when we have to.   
Other than that, things are proceeding well - I recommended to her to read up on potential locations she is interested in, even though there is no formal position advertised, and we'll take it from there. After all, when I did my assignment, there was no formal job position advertised, but we made it happen. Anything is possible, with persistence and a bit of luck/sending the right email at the right time.

			This is a horticulture question.  I'm looking for a fungus strain to add to soil to promote mycorrhiza.   
I'm planning to plant a line of Privet (Ligustrum Vulgare Antrovirens) as a hedge.  I'd like to make sure the roots get all the help it needs through mycorrhiza with a fungus strain.  This plant specie is Endo Micorrhizal.  Any idea what kind of fungus to get, and where?  I believe with a small batch of the right fungus, I can continue to cultivate as much of it as I need.  Any idea what these are called here?

			After moving to a new apartment and all the chao I started checking all the bills I was paying and I noticed a TV-Telephone fee. I asked my management what was it and  Not surprisingly, I was paying for a TV connection that I was not using since I had Swisscom from day 1 I moved. 
It seems the building had a service from a random small company in switzerland and the cost was included in the nebenkost.   I managed to get it cancelled.    
So now, am I really responsible to cancel such services when I move in a new apartment? Don't they need a contract to get my money? 
How comes the contract was transferred to my name without my knowledge (excluding my negligence) lol

			Since municipal police in Geneva Canton had to get permission a few years back from the grand conseil to carry batons, I don't think anyone will let you carry a quasi deadly weapon such as a taser.   
Prior to 2011ish, Municipal police in GE were limited to carrying pepper spray and nothing else.

			According to gemeinde and the letter from SVA he would normally only have been entitled to help in 2015, he applied late so they had the 2013 returns, they only consider them if there has been a change in circumstance according to her, that may not be exact but it's how the letter translated, either way, as he only applied after filing tax returns this year( it was the guy doing his returns that told him about the help was available) his initial request was denied and had he accepted that then he would not have got the help, but appealing the decision got them to look at the 2013 returns. 
Things are looking up for him now, hopefully his hard times are behind him.

Their service (order and delivery) has been excellent and the quality of their pre-made canvases and brushes really good. I have bought their own brand of acrylic paints (the jury is still out on that - some of the coverage of some of the pigments has been a little weak). Their prices seem ok.

I have seen this in the Bernise Oberland on many occasions while hiking through the mountains, summer and winter. I have found hiking in during winter with all the basics including a titanium stove to be quite an experience. But I would recommend getting to know the locals and asking which farmers allow hikers to pitch their tents. I have seen tents at picknick areas, summer and winter and also in the woods too. Just choose a quiet area to pitch away from critical eyes. If you do it in a tourist area then the authorities will move you on. Also if you hike in using well used roads/trails you may attract attention. So bear that in mind. Probably better to drive in as far as possible and then head straight into the forest when there are no people around in the early evening in summer and just after sunset in winter. If you do it in winter then prepare your planned camping site in advance so you can finish setting up camp before it gets too late.   
If you are new to camping then stick to the camp sites. If you are new to winter camping then again stick to the camp sites untill you learn how to run a winter camp in most conditions. The last thing you want is for your tent to blow over in high winds with the stove running! Stove pipes and the tent itself or a combination of the two have a habit of catching the wind and tearing poorly installed tent pegs out. Not funny seeing the tent and stove pipe flying away down the mountain in the middle of the night. That is the best way to kill yourself.

If you however have the means to pay with the single payment option available free of charge, then you have a chance to save some money.   
You will (usually) get your ticket, but forget about after sale service. If you need to rebook or cancel, they will charge you additional fees.   
I used to use these kind of services once in a while and managed to save money, but was well aware of the risks. Nowadays I just book directly with the airline, unless a middleman can sell me a connection which is otherwise not bookable elsewhere.

In the US I know they have residential places like this one that might provide a good environment to process this trauma.         
I wouldn't leave the US if she has medical insurance there.

			Hi, and many thanks for all the replies.This certainly is food for thought.    
Yes, my son has my partner's surname, which I never thought would be such a hindrance. Surely there are people in Switzerland who have children out of wedlock? And how DO single parents cope there if children are coming home for 2 hours at lunch?

			A good equivalent for Woolite is ....... Woolite.   
Available here - certainly on the Le Shop site, so Migros should have it, if nothing else.   
Failing that, Migros 'Yvette' line looks the same ..... down to 20 degrees / hand or machine wash.

			Hi   
how many people are you looking for a house for?   
What date in January?   
The date is important if it clashes with the Xmas/New Year holidays, where people will be paying the high premium & probably renting by the week.   
I was looking at a possible house, that normally rents for the week, but subject to availability and you prepared to pay a very high price in the thousands, but it only sleeps 6.  That owner is very fussy and I am almost sure will not allow more than 6, i.e. would rather have it empty than too many people & does not rent it cheap.   
Either go with what others have already suggested or perhaps rent apartment.  There are apartments that rent for single night, like a hotel.

			So I ordered this item from America approximately 10 days ago, and when I track my order it says:

It says Postal customs clearance process underway CH- although it's been about 4 days. I'm just wondering if it's a problem within my item which is simply a skateboard. Or if it usually does take this long. And how long might this take? Last question do I have to pick up my item or do they deliver to door?

			Does anyone know of any private rooms in Basel that a group could use for a poker night?  Ideally this would be connected to a bar, restaurant or hotel so we could order drinks.  We won't (technically...) be playing for money so hopefully this doesn't create any issues with gambling licenses.   
I checked at the casino near the airport, but they don't offer private rooms.

			Hello Chris,   
I would be very interested in playing with you!  I have actually played as soloist with the Johannesburg Symphony twice between 1993-5 (when I was around 13 years of age)...not sure if you were a member then!   
I have a BM from Eastman School, MM from New England Conservatory and Royal Academy of Music in London and received a DMA from Penn State Univ. last year.   I'm in Switzerland for my husband's post-doc position and have just started collaborating with a violinist.  Perhaps we could do a clarinet trio, and I would be happy to do some sonata duos as well!   
Please send me a message if you would be interested.

Have you tried googling for reviews on them? I always find this helpful to do, as well as asking around.   
Also, what about contacting   directly?

			Perfecthair.ch sells hair coloring products. There are also a number of German sites, i've used masterhair.de - these are professional products - goldwell, wella, schwarzkopf, etc. I think they also sell products aimed at consumers, not sure.    
I used to buy enough for a year at a time and it was worth the import/tax from Germany.     
I used to use goldwell colorance, Demi -permanent and really liked it, but I've stopped dying my hair.

On a more (hopefully) useful track though, have you considered sending your daughter to a local Kindergarten and hort instead? From what I have heard, the bilingual and international schools have a higher turnover of children due to the children being moved from country to country with their parents jobs.     
With a local school she would be less likely to be losing friends on a regular basis, and would be likely to have more of her friends living locally.     
Just a thought :-)

			my only experience was with spare laptop battery, as was unable to post from UK to overseas, the one time I posted it, got a letter back saying dangerous item and destroyed.   
Anyway took on fight as hand luggage in the protective pack.  Separated out at the security check along with other items.  Was taken to one side for checking by some machine the person used and was asked if it was a spare for laptop I had.   
I recall there was something about the size and amount of cells or something when reading up, but do not have that to hand now & that was to do with laptop battery.

2. Others have answered fine.      I think that's a little bit absolute. Sure you should stay in tune with your doctor, but many are more interested in curing 'normal' illnesses rather than (say) the 'illness' of aging. (I appreciate the OP seems to be coming from the body-building side, but people take supplements for lots of reasons). While standard multivitamin tablets don't really have much form in studies, there are supplements which do have some interesting results.   
I'm certainly interested in ameliorating even the possibility of age-related cognitive decline (which does seem to be inevitable in almost everybody) and life extension in general (I'm of the generation which has such faith in science that I believe I just have to live enough to hook into vastly increased lifespans).    
Phospholipid supplements (phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine) have shown some good results for both brain and liver protection. Vinpocetine for cerebel blood flow. Vitamins D and K (the K is particularly important to avoid dumping calcium into your arteries) are, of course, current superstars which many people don't get enough of (the RDA is considered by many researchers to be too low). For mitochondrial decline, Acetyl-L-carnitine and Coq10 can be helpful. Resveratrol while not quite as hot as it was in the early naughties, is still holding promise for switching on 'calorie-restriction'-type genes, again for life extension.   
Of course, if you've interested in this sort of thing, you should study it deeply and come to your own conclusions.

			The offer of accept as they meant or refund is as good as it gets and this would be typical of the idea of customer service : It redresses your position prior to the purchase  but  no reason to try and stop you providing your view on this to others .. and impacting future sales  
Seven years in this never ceases to amaze me how this can work : my simple mechanism is to never return to those who peddle this service and reward those that show the individual spark of attention .     
I would go for the refund and go for the darkened bathroom experience or perhaps more fun a spa day

They were turned back at the French border by the French guards.    
They were very unlucky though, since 99.99% of the time, there were no guards at the border (Autoroute), even before Schengen.

			Thanks - it appears that the J15 is on a 380v line, controlled by a 10 amp breaker labeled 'milchmaschine'. The 20 amp breaker labeled 'steckdose 125' must control a different outlet that I have yet to locate...and seems like it is wired for 125v, given the 20 amp breaker. 
 How? I'm not sure -as far as I can figure a step down transformer would be needed behind the panel or in line to the outlet.  If I could find the transformer, I could tap into it on the supply side and temporarily install a 16 amp 230v outlet. 
Alternatively, maybe I could take one of the three 220 leads going to the 380v 3phase J15, along with the neutral and ground, and hook up that way? (capping off the other two leads). But that breaker is also only rated at 10 amps.   
If it weren't illegal to go behind the panel, I'd temp. install a 16 amp breaker and hook up a 16 amp extension cord directly to it. That's how I've powered heavy equipment on residential job sites in the past...but I don't think that would go over too well in CH without a license.   
This is my own project i'm working on, so I can't just tell the homeowner that they need a new line installed.   
The barn is owned by a verein, so getting permission to tamper with anything would be a nightmare, even if it were legal...They'd schedule a meeting to discuss it sometime before the year is over...and then tell me I have to hire a CH certified electrician to charge me a fortune for turning the screwdriver lol.   
Looks like I'll be asking the farmer neighbor if he has a 16 amp circuit i can use - and if so, i'll be schlepping stone back and forth on my bike for each custom cut.

. with the same paper the bank Raiffeisen opened the account for me. 
BUT I was staying already in a temporary accommodation in Switzerland.

			English will be more helpful than Italian even with the authorities.   
Once I've been to the Lausanne police station (to report an incident that happened to my car), there was a guy at the window next to me who could speak Italian only, no English neither French. He was really struggling to get understood.  
In general, you can survive with English only without major problem, but of course, French (even if basic) will make it much easier.

			You can buy such stuff here, too. 
It's usually in the forms of juices and costs a ridiculous amount of money.   
Ah, here is one (googled for ""saftkuren""):     
7 days, collection of the juices in Zurich: 528 CHF.   
First, you pay through the nose for all the expensive food in Switzerland, and then you pay even more to shed the extra-weight again ;-)     
AFAIK, the most effective way to lose weight is to completely remove carbs from your diet and do some exercise at the same time.   
In any case, try to cut back on the carbs as much as possible (snacks etc.pp.).   
My fitness-oriented co-workers eat lot's of vegetables and cottage-cheese, together with protein-shakes....   
There are probably dozens of threads with hundreds of postings about effective weight-loss strategies on EF alone - and it isn't even a health-oriented forum.

We will try eBay/ Ricardo next time, but for now OH will just need to cough up as a promise to a boy is a promise.    
Thanks all for sharing so much information. Perhaps later I'll post a picture of the goodies  .

			Don't agree with you regards the cost of cleaning the machine. Just picked up a descaler from Nespresso yesterday for 6.50 chf. 
Doesn't seem extreme to me & we use the machine regularly, are in a reasonably high calcium area regards water & clean once every three months or so.

			I've belonged to both. There are nice people in both and it really depends on the activities, and whether you are a person who ""joins"" easily. I'd take a look at the websites and, as MC suggests, try something out. The AWCZ has a monthly coffee morning. I'm no longer a member of either, not through any fault of the organizations though.    
Both groups have a fair number of older women, but also younger women too, so it is wide ranging. Not everyone has a Swiss husband. Lots of expats too, and a few people on local contracts.   
The AWCZ will have more US stuff, obviously - thanksgiving dinner, lots of voting info, etc. they do have a library and a clubhouse for events. They are a member of FAWCO, a charitable organization of American women's clubs abroad.    
Everyone in ZIWA seems to speak English, but it is international, so no focus on US specifically. Without a clubhouse or library, there is less overhead, and membership is less expensive. It also seemed to me that events were in more varied places.

			For the last puzzle I did which I wanted to hang, I bought some of the fixing puzzle glue at Manor. I gave it three coats so it was good and firm. Then I got a blank mounted canvas sheet from an art shop (the ones you would use to paint a picture onto) and sprayed it with glue. And stuck the jigsaw onto it. I gave it 24 hours to dry before hanging it.  
Art shops sell a wide range of canvas sizes, and its much lighter to hang than a picture frame. And I think the puzzle pieces look better without a sheet of glass in front of them. 
Just an alternative suggestion in case you cant find a picture frame :-)

Occitane's no parabens no alu vervena is really good, too, nice and lemony, it's masculine but girls can pull it off. That one it's more about perfume, and less about efficiency, but it's pleasant too.    
Nothing will beat actually washing yourself quick with some soap, I know it can be a tricky thing to do in public restroom, but if you are wearing acrylic button up dress shirts, and there is a bathrooom you can use privately, it's the most you can do to beat unpleasant sweat, instead of piling up chemical stuff and having hormones eat into your clothes.    
By the way, the smell does not have to be you, but your clothes. If shirts are not properly washed, or mildewed, you don't even have to sweat to give out odor, just by warming the fabric as you wear it.    
I try to stay away from alu and parabens as much as I can, too.

Can anyone recommend where to buy a foam pad for a rug in the Zurich area? The rug is 290 cm by 190 cm.     
Thanks!!

			There is a dust filter   when you open the door. Look down on the front wall of the machine (between the drum and the outside). You pull up the filter to get it out (and clean it after each use). If you do not clean this filter it will take forever to dry the clothes.   
The filter at the bottom of the front is another filter.   
As mentioned, they have been able to use the tube from the condenser tray (top left of the machine) to drain the water directly into the drain that is used for the washing machine so there is no need to empty/worry about the condenser tray. This is the clear tube you see running from the back of the machine to the drain.

			USPS will definitely be the cheapest.  We enquired some years ago about sending some clothing and books back from our holiday there and found UPS, Fedex, etc, wanted to charge $100 more for the same service.  Which was economy postal delivery via USPS, i.e. about 3-4 weeks to get to Switzerland.  This is the best option for you if you don't need the items quickly, i.e. winter clothing, books, magazines, etc.   
For the computers I'd guess UPS/Fedex may be better though more costly.  The question with all of them is will they be gentle enough that your computers won't arrive in bits.

			Good day,     
I did read through threads and are aware that printing can be done at most groceries shops and post office.     
But... I have about 200 pages to print. I did go to the library also and they ask me 0.20chf per page regardless of amount.     
Is there maybe any other place that I could do printing and pay less per page as it is 'bulk' near Zug?     
I do appreciate any help a lot!

			Thanks for all your input! I never had my hair colored before so I have no idea about these things...   
Since my hair is pretty long, and she started the color on the last few inches (like an ombre) I guess I will wait a few months and then chop off a good bit of my hair!   
I don't want to spend more money on going to the salon to have it colored again!  And def don't want to go green    
Live and learn I guess!

			I love my mum, but she has always been the best at making me feel guilty.  
I think it's a daughter mum thing. 
With me it was..   
""Why did you finish with your  serious boyfriend (he was so lovely, even got grandma a television)""    
""When are you going to find another boyfriend?""    
When I was 24 (24!) she found out I was on the pill.... 
""You have really come down in my estimation"" (that one really upset me.)   
I have no children.. 
""Who will look after you when you are old?""    
I was terrified of telling her I was moving to Switzerland.   
Now I try to avoid the subject when she mentions us going back to the UK.   
She has mellowed a lot over the years, mostly when my little sister had children. 
She obviously adores me however, and I her.   
Hang in there Coconut, maybe your friend and brother will have babies and take the pressure off you.  
It's your life, don't let your mother get to you.

			if you want to produce music, the first thing is to get your tools of the trade in order, understanding music harmony these days with all the technology is not a must, but is a huuge plus, also learn your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) of preference really well, as well as you know how to use microsoft word or even facebook, this would make your songwriting easier and hace a better workflow. Good daws for producing music are Logic Pro and Ableton, Pro Tools is a great DAW for audio mixing. If you want to get good at EDM (Electronic Music) production, listen to a looooot of electronic music, get used to the sound of the kicks, count the bars from each section, take a good a listen at all the sounds in the songs, EDM is not as hard to compose but is really hard to get the right sounds. Is all about vocabulary!

			Hello everyone    
 Well, I have a strange problem, I want to sell my Nikon camera + lens and two SD cards ... I went looking for any store or place where they could buy my camera. Some time ago I got a few tips on where to go and yesterday I was at HB in fotopro, where I was told that they only buy in exchange for other goods. So I wonder  if some of you have some experience with these places?  I tried already ricardo, ebay , anibis etc. but it takes a long time and i would like to sell this camera as soon as possible.  I was maybe thinking about visiting bruckenhaus, but im not sure if they would take that kind of thing and even if they would pay anything at all.... if you know about something I would be grateful for any advice   Thanks Vero

			I just wanted to say that I've experienced the same problem too! It's definately not stress as I've gone from being a nurse in A and E in London, working shifts etc, to a happy housewife living by the lake in a beautiful country. All I can put it down to is the water! Look what it does to your stainless steel kitchenware! 
I've been here about five months now and I definately think it is starting to slow down. I'm lucky that I have got lots of hair! The only things that I reccommend are: Try not to get too worried about it!Try not to touch it too much and leave it as long as possible between washing. Good luck!

			Unfortunately not. The shop will prepare a form you will need to have stamped at the Danish customs (e.g. in Copenhagen airport) when leaving the country. At the customs you will have to document that you are leaving the country (show boarding card/ticket) and document that you are residing in Switzerland (show permit), they might also ask to see the watch.    
After you have send the stamped form back to the shop they will refund the VAT.    
I bought my watch in a one of most well reputed watch shops in Copenhagen and they were very familiar with the process.   
Most shops selling high-end goods (watches, jewellery etc.) will gladly refund the full VAT. Some shops are using Global Blue or similar where you will only get a fraction of the total VAT refunded.   
Finally, as the VAT is 25% the deduction is 20% when you are reversing the calculation (hope it makes sense).

Its pretty much across the street from Trampolino, slightly smaller I'd say, but has free entrance for adults, and different toys for kids.

Mallorca is beautiful. We will definitely go back. In the end we stayed in a hotel in the middle of Palma. With A/C! WiFi wasnt that good but we didnt stay inside for long anw.

			The psychologist you working with knows why she suggested a lawyer. It's not a threat for the school, to push them, but lawyers efficiently and professionally function as no fuss mediators. You do not want to repeat the scenario you and your kid were in already. If school is interested in protecting both of the parties of minors involved, they will step up their involvement. Which is win-win for the kids.

			Megs,    
Regarding manicure and pedicure. Based on my extensive research, I say what you need is somenone NOT Swiss. I am Russian (from Ukraine) and can recommend you a Russian lady on Forchstrasse. She worked in several salons, then had a nail desk in MANOR, where the turnaround of customers was huge. I mean she is not 100% the I approve (I am a perfectionist when it comes to nails). but I would say good 90%. Don't get me wrong, it is very hard to please me, I am a tought customer. She is the best that someone can find  .

Not sure where to post this so hopefully here is ok!   
I live in Birmensdorf and am wondering if there is anyone else on here who has a young baby (mine is 9 weeks) and lives in the area who would be interested in meeting up? I know there is the babies and bumps event which I will try and get to, but was thinking there might be someone in the neighbourhood!   
Reply or PM me if you're interested!

			Hey i hope you are doing good 
Well you can make loads of things from wooden sticks so need to worry. The first thing you can make out of it is doll house. Recently me and my daughter made a lovely doll house. its really beautiful.Last week i went to my sister's home and she bought a really beautiful lamp and it was made of wooden sticks.I really like the style of that lamp.  For more good ideas i will suggest you to visit one site it will help you in a more professional way  
I have personally visited his site and it is completely about wooden sticks and its utilization.

Clothes are the one thing I have a hard time with here, so I buy most of mine in the US or UK.

			We ended up getting ourselves one of these:     
It solved all our problems because we had nowhere to install a ""conventional"" washing machine. But this one is so light that you just move in into place (in our case, we sit it on the end of the bathtub) when you want to use it and voilà. You can connect the inlet pipe to an ordinary tap (or bucket load it like we do) and you are away laughing.   
...oh, and did I mention it only takes 15min to wash, 15min to rinse, and 5min to spin....with the clothes coming out really dry.

But that does not alter the fact that the OP is responsible for the damage (as the parent of the offender), and is now seemly trying to get out of paying up.    
Unless there's a physical paper trail, there's no proof of fraud; the car owner could always say it was a simple misunderstanding due to language problems on the part of both parties, and reading back through the thread there is no mention at all of there being anything in writing, it's just 'he said, I said'.  
Which won't stand up in court.  
And I guess it's still possible that the car owner could sue for costs as the OP has admitted that his son being responsible.... but there again it's the same scenario, unless there is something in writing it's going to be difficult to prove: for both sides.   
It all comes down to morals in the end; can you justify (and live with the thought of) not paying for damage you're responsible for just because the other party isn't a saint?

Here is a followup to my search in hopes that it may help others.   
I found a transformer for EUR 129 here:       
I ordered it online and it was delivered a few days later. I paid CHF 29 for the importation and then bought a CHF 10 euro to swiss adapter.   
It performs well and I am happy with the purchase. Too bad I could not find any store in Basel that sells this nor could they order one for me.

He does all the measurement and fitting in Zürich in a hotel or at your premises/office and shirts and suits are made and shipped from HK soon after.

- you would take to work (i.e. smart casual)...  
- it is larger than what you would use for ""city backpack"", i.e. more than 15, 20, 25l,  
- has features that you do not need in the city, i.e. hydration system, etc.

			Your daughter is going through a perfectly normal process. Praise her whenever she's talking constructively about her feelings and be understanding (but not supportive) when she's just emotional and upset.   
When ""they talk only German to her"", she's actually not supposed to do anything. Just listen and stay relaxed, without the pressure to understand and learn. Within only 1 year she'll speak fluently and, given her age, without her original accent. What a great opportunity for her!

			Hello forum members,   
I would be really grateful if you could help me understand the reallocation procedures. 
So we (a family of 3) are moving from Leuven, Belgium to Lausanne at the end of August. We want to take some of our belongings with us -- mostly of personal value - books, decorations, and also clothing, kitchen utensils and some ikea furniture (mainly our baby's)   
so here are the questions:   
1. what is the best option to do that? shipping company? renting a truck ourselves?   
2. if we are moving personal belongings (either ourselves with a truck or using a moving/shipping company), do we need to pay duties? if so, how does that work?   
any suggestions regarding this inquiry (shipping companies; truck rental; anything else you know from your experience) are welcome and appreciated

			I cannot imagine moving house and not forwarding the mail....   
Miss one bill or official document and you are going to be in a lot more hassle than 50chf....   
I consider it just a standard moving cost.   
It also helps to avoid having to notify every last company and organization you deal with of your change of address.. We do the key ones, like phone, internet,electricity, etc, but then when redirected mail appears, we know we need to notify those organizations.

Have you tried asking in some of the more up-market wedding dress shops in your area?   
The idea of framing dresses has become quite popular recently and they should know if anyone does; if there's a way of raking in a few extra quid from an already eye-wateringly expensive market they'll be in on it. 
Or try looking at the small ads at the back of a wedding magazine.

			Both Aldi and Lidl do all sorts of special offers that are non food, but it just depends on what they think they'll sell at certain times of the year.  Plants and seeds have been big recently.  The OH got some nice work trousers in Lidl last week for CHF17 each.   
It's easy enough to check both websites:           
Mostly football and cycling stuff at the moment.  If things are really popular you need to get there the day the offers start, otherwise they'll be gone.

			I guess private schools can be a hit or miss, some time ago they raided and revoked the license from a montessori school around here, and arrested the director, on charges of bad education and financial crimes. The cantonal authorities also checked on two schools in Geneva because they were allegedly teaching creationism in the science class.  
Private schools are controlled by associations or foundations, and feuds/mobbing/favoritism are typical of this sort of organizations, regardless of what they do. This is a problem when it comes to schools because it's children that get messed with, it's not a fishing club.    
The estabilished/old ones are good though, even the north korean dictator sent his son to a boarding school in Switzerland.

			Was living in London, agency rang me about a job in Basel which sounded interesting, was interviewed in London, offered job, google-mapped Basel, turned up.  Anywhere would be OK for 6 months to a year, right?  I would have gotten some new work experience, lived somewhere I'd never visited before, and life carries on.   
That was over 4 years ago.  I kind of like it here, and the job's still suiting me.

			I was thinking the same as Swisspea. It's a bit long to wait for an appointment. This is why I like the telemedicine service. My husband had some bizarre allergic reaction (not medically induced), but he called the telemedicine folk and they sent him straight to emergency.   
And it wasn't as bad as anaphylactic shock, just a load of hives and lip swelling. But being in pain and anxious about it is just as bad.    
Has the original doctor's office seen this? I do think a week is a long time to wait.

			If the bike was built without (additional) gears [(there are gears already of course, just a fixed choice  )], then adding gears that can be shifted will be costly. The most reasonable way would be to add a geared rear hub, but that plus the shifter plus quite likely building a new wheel around the hub, and all the labor, will cost a .

			Not sure what kind of restore they have done, but if they have only restored the file system, you may still be lucky and have all your data (posts, content) in the DB.   
If you have some sort of access to the db (through cPanel or ssh or anyhow), try to see the tables.   
it could that when restoring the filesystem, the tables have been created with a different prefix, in that case, you will still have some chances to recover part of the data (not the theme, but probably your posts, at least in plain text)

			about ottos, i found it hard to find anything that is real wood.. price reflects that i think. At least at ikea if you look hard enough there are some all wooden series, Hemnes for example.   
Have a look at  , they have ok looking furniture and   (aktuelle Werbung) its an ok price on the surface, the only thing is if you look closely at some of the small print in the shop, there is just not enough real wood in the item to justify the price.. plenty of mdf, oak veneer., with just the fronts full on wood.. still it looks better than a lot of the ikea ottos stuff?   
Jysk delivery charges are 80 chf for under 10km, 100 chf for over 10km, works out about the same if not a bit cheaper than ikea depending on the amount you buy.

			Unfortunately your story is very believable, I am pleased you received all 4 items after such a long wait.    
The Swiss post is a 'holy' institution here, people do not believe things can go wrong!    
About 2 years ago I ordered about CHF 500 in foreign cash from Post Finance. It arrived by normal post into my 'Locked' letter box, in an envelope with large letters ""Swiss Bankers prepaid services"" on the outside. I complained to my local post office, and he muttered that he would ""ask around"". Since then I have always given my address as ""Postlagernd"" or ""Post Restante"" and collected the cash envelope at the post office counter. It does now at least come in a second plain envelope!    
DHL are the worst, and items from German Post always come with DHL delivery in Switzerland. They dump the box in front of the outside house door, & do not even ring the door bell. I now also always give my address as ""Postlagernd"" or ""Post Restante"" to be sure to receive my parcel. 3 years ago I arrived home to find a parcel for my son had been left outside on top of the letter boxes, by DHL again! On the outside of the box was a declaration stating that Fr 82,-- in Swiss taxes & charges had still to be paid on this very expensive camera lens. Luckily the address was wrong on the parcel: the DHL operator had found our correct address, and presumably never told anyone, as we never received another demand for the tax.

			There's a thread where someone else needed an adapter for a Canon camera battery charger, the kind where the plug rotates 90 degrees to plug into the wall and snaps back flat for storage. I have one of these, and I have an adapter that I bought in an electrician's store. I also posted the pic in the thread. I can't find the pic on my computer, so search for camera battery charger adapter or something like that, and you ought to find the thread.

Ammonia can be handled (but not stored) as a liquid at room temperature/standard pressure....this is a common confusion of boiling point and enthalpy of vaporisation. Ammonia has a high enthalpy of vaporisation meaning once liquid it does not boil that easily. Practically if you want liquid ammonia you turn your cylinder upside down and the ammonia will pour out as a liquid (when the cylinder is the correct way up the ammonia vents as a gas).   
Anyway none of this helps the OP as it would be a brave move to use liquid ammonia outside of a fume cupboard! Try gin or ultrasonic bath as cricketer suggested, never tried it but I hear it works well.

Hey, another question regarding this.. I have done a search but .. can't find anything..   
now I have two apple accounts, one Swiss, one English..  as my son got a few itunes cards for his b'day, we need to spend this money   in the Swiss account, if we buy a movie whose original version is English, and which says on the languages in the Itunes swiss store: German and English, can you really watch it in both languages?? as we only have English spoken movies I've never tried to change the language, can't imagine where you would go about changing this..   
sorry for dumb question but .. need to know before loosing 15 + chf in a movie ..

			I have a bright red winter coat...haven't experienced any staring.  But since your wife's coat needs to see her through to the apocalypse, I'd go with black or grey.  These are colours that will be practical for many occasions, regardless of what skirt/trousers/hat/scarf she wears.   
As an engineer she should love Switzerland.  There is a set of rules for lots of things...and if you follow the rules, everything works exactly as prescribed :-)   
Down jacket will see her through many years of winters.  I don't know the brand Canada Goose, but people here do not seem brand obsessed, so having a ""foreign"" brand won't be a staring issue.     
Why not google images of zurich to help her see some street scenes and identify coat criteria?   
(PS she should take the coat off in the cosy bunker....those things are very well insulated and she'd stand out wearing the coat)

One came back at 28/29 in 2000, so still within the age limit but he was just not needed. I'm not sure how old the other person I know was but he came back around 2004/5. He was also not needed.

			Hi all!     
I am interested in learning some art or craft work. Have dealt with water and canvas painting before but would like to enhance my skills further.     
Hence, I would love to follow some art courses. I stay in Schaffhausen but am willing to travel till Zurich if I find something really interesting. Another constraint is I speak   with little bit German. So lets not count on German for now.     
I am open to the following options:     
- a couple of persons or a larger group. 
- painting, architecture, crafts etc.  
 - in depth studies and practice would be great (Not looking for a one day session)     
I know school of Migros and Zurich university of Arts but they teach in German. Anyone knows any other institutes or teachers.     
Thanks, 
Anita

			Sorry, I had to laugh a bit at this one. It is beyond me how anyone can think this or any country (aka eventually the idiots who actually still work and pay taxes) would just hand out 4000/month to everyone for nothing in exchange. Money doesn't exactly grow on trees...   
So, no, of course you won't be given 4000/month to do nothing, and even less so if you're not even living here. This current discussion is about defining a minimum wage on a federal level as there's currently no such thing. So, if adopted, every working person everywhere in Switzerland, regardless of job and responsibility, would have to earn at least 4000/month. People who don't work get nothing - this initiative is about establishing a certain salary level, not about some kind of social security or, well, an outright handout. The vote takes place in three weeks.    
The Grundeinkommen is a different matter, i.e. the idea about giving every person in Switzerland, working or not, 2500/month to secure a basic level of existence. I doubt this would be extended to Swiss people living abroad, but I actually don't know. The vote on this one isn't until later in the year or even next year.    
My guess is neither of these initiatives stand a chance.   
If you have a Swiss passport, you can move here any time and then find work, for which you will receive a salary, like in every other country.

However I am quite sure that they do expect than on the first day (after coffee) I will be going to the foreign office to apply for it rather than start working at 100% of time.

			Hello, I'm reviving this thread with a similiar concern about tutti. 
I recently found a designer item on there that I'd really like to get, but the price is somehow unbelievable. I did all the checks: 
- photos look home made 
- Seller has 3 other items such as a children's bike and jewellery with same background 
- I contacted the seller (by sms) and they gave me a ubs bank account and the place they live in 
- They have a Swiss bluemail email   
I think it is a genuine seller based on this info however I cant go and see this item in person which would be the safest way, since I'm in Basel and the person lives in Appenzell. The seller said the item is new and with the original box that was also in the picture. The only thing really that makes me hesitant is the price which personally I put on the person being from the country side, or that the brand is not that well known in Switzerland, or that it was a present so the seller doesn't know the value. 
I have never used this website before so I'd like to know about other people's experiences with it? Do you think I should go ahead? If it really is a scam, I still have that person's bank info, although I have no idea how a procedure like that would work.

			Some things to check are:  
1. Is it on a domestic tariff ? During the time the house was being built, the builders may have had it on a special tariff. Or maybe you have signed up for some special eco solar tariff. 
2. On the bill, is it clear what you pay per KWH (day / night). Look at your suppliers home page to see if that is the best deal. 
3. Does your meter register electricity usage when you have turned off all your lights / appliances in the house ? 
4. Do you neighbour's lights go out if you turn off the electricity at the main fuse box ?

As for Josefa and her degree, she may not be able to be a full architect with 'sign off' rights but she can be a drafts person and work in the field. I know someone who has an architecture degree from Bolivia and that was his experience.    
Of course this is assuming she gets a permit through marriage. Getting a permit for a drafting job is probably not likely or at least not at all easy.

			Ok, I am confused.  If you were vacuuming on top of the cabinet and dropped part of the vacuum behind the cabinet that contains the fridge, shouldn't you first ascertain if there is a back to the cabinet?   
In other words, is the cabinet that contains the fridge backless or not?  If it has a back, then the vacuum apparatus is nowhere near the back of the refrigerator coils and poses no risk except as a future bug condo.   
If the cabinet is backless, then just do as above and unmount the fridge from the cabinet and pull it out.  Be careful and don't scratch the sides of the fridge!

1660	null	null	null	null	"    Oh wow, well that is quite a fluctuation. No bikes, huh!   
Back home in Finland many schools also have restrictions regarding kids coming to school with bikes; often these rules are explained as safety concerns, but sometimes the motivation is as simple as insufficient parking space for bikes. Parents at some of these schools have raised the issue, resulting in a statement from national authorities, saying that a school has no right to tell the students what vehicles they can and cannot operate outside school hours and school premises. So even with a school ban on bikes kids may come to school on bikes and just leave them outside school grounds...   
I haven't thought about trying that here; luckily it's not necessary since the school is really close.

			Many thanks to Belgianmum, Kamarate, stephen NE, carlasmom, Noth for your quick replies and very useful information.     
We would prefer living in a small town with local shops and public transport to the city center so I guess Colombier (or Boudry) may be the first place to look, based on the information you gave. I am also thinking about living around the trains station since I can take the company shuttle bus from there, as Stephen NE said.  If we live alone the lake side, I may take the 15mins walk from the tram stop in Boudry.  Thanks Stephen NE for the information.  I had a look on google map but was not sure if there was a walk path or pavement along the way to the company.    
Many thanks again.  I will probably post more questions in the next few weeks.

If on normal taxation, GL taxes are less than Zürich city, a bit more than the gold coast, on par with many Gemeinden. If on Quellensteuer, only a few hundred francs more than ZH.   
The largest savings, taxwise, will be in SZ and ZG - and housing prices tend to reflect that. However, because home ownership is high in SZ, one can sometimes find surprisingly decent value in rental housing - if one stays away from Hedgefundville.

			Another trip to the Co-Op Bau+Hobby in AUgst, and this time took a odd-shaped shelf, sort of trapezoid, to fit into a corner cabinet. The kindly gentleman there made me a copy without batting an eyelid, in minutes. Even better than I could ever have using hand tools.  The point is, they don't seem to be limited to squares and rectangles.

			Hi everyone,   
I moved from Australia to Luzern in Oct 2013 and am finally finished with the bureaucratic stuff enough to be looking for an ensemble to join or just some people to do music stuff with.   
I play classical piano and violin -- I was very good at both once upon a time though now my hands are quite screwed up from so much typing (I'm a programmer). I also play tenor sax (mostly jazz/blues stuff... can't really get into rock). Sax is entirely self taught over the last 5 or so years so I have a ways to go but it's still fun!    
Anyway, does anyone know of any ensembles in the Luzern area? Or anyone else around looking to get together and play some classical/jazz for fun?   
Elise

			You do not need a fishing license to practice Freiangelrecht. Nor does the requirement for the test and license have anything to do with the size of the fish.  
No keep nets, no barbs, no artificial lures or live or dead baitfish while practicing freiangelrecht. For further info you need to check the cantonal regulations.   
You could potentially get people in trouble if you disseminate wrong info, I don't really understand the rush to answer a question if you're not sure of the answer....

			Hi SwissMs2000   
Of course you need it insured, and if it can be covered on the house insurance then that is fairly straightforward.  
If you are unable to display them all you can have them on rotation, which makes it great fun making a selection every 6-12 months.  
If you need any advice with archiving, storage, collection management etc let me know, I have 10 years experience in this field.

			Hello everyone!   I am completely new to this forum. I've scoured the boards but haven't yet found an answer my question, so I hope you can help.   
Some background:    
I have recently accepted a job offer in Gland, between Geneva and Lausanne. 
I am getting a relocation/expat package that includes the option of either having the company pay for the cost of shipping my personal effects or cash-in-lieu. I am thinking of taking cash-in-lieu, because I am just one person (no spouse or kids) and will be shipping little to no furniture. I'll just be shipping what'll probably amount to less than 10 boxes (not sure about actual size estimate, maybe 1 or 2 sq meters?) with just clothing, shoes, books, other personal items, maybe a few kitchen things. So, cash-in-lieu seems like the better deal.   
I am an American citizen and am currently living in California, but I was previously working in Asia. And because I wasn't sure of where I'd end up when I left, I left about six boxes with a friend there, with money so he can ship them to me via freight later.   
Well, he has to move out in April, and I'm not due to move to Switzerland until late May/early June. Now, I could ship these boxes to my current location in the US, but I really don't need these things now, and I would rather not have to ship them twice. So, I'd like to ship them to Switzerland from Asia.    
Now, they'll take 4-6 weeks to get there, so I might get there at the same time as the boxes. But of course, I will need to ship them to some address, and I know it will take me a while to find permanent accommodation.   
My question: Does anyone have experience with this kind of situation? Can you recommend some kind of storage facility in Geneva or Vaud (I don't know exactly where I'll live yet but probably Geneva or Lausanne) that not only has the storage space but the personnel for someone to accept these mailed packages? (I have found   but haven't contacted them yet). I also know there are storage rooms for rent on homegate.ch. But is it even possible to mail these boxes to a storage facility if I'm not there to accept (issues with clearing customs)? Just wondering if anyone has any tips for me.   
Thanks!

			Hi Everybody,   
I am looking for any advice on being ""Gasteltern""=hosting family for children for a week in summer. The neighbouring village is organising an international festival for children this summer and the local association has placed advertisements that they need hosting families for kids from a few European countries, including Switzerland. They request to provide sleeping arrangements, breakfast and sometimes dinner (which is OK) as well as transport if kids cannot reach the festival venue on foot within reasonable time. I have sent a few questions to the organizers before committing to anything: about insurances, split of responsibilities, etc. And it obviously takes them time to answer.   
Are there any hidden reefs? If you have any previous experience, please, share.   
Thanks a lot and have a wonderful day.

O.K. o.k. but that's precisely my point. ""Productive"" according to whom? Surely accoriding to the people organizing (otherwise they wouldn't organize them, right?).    
But my point is that if the company doesn't bother explaining to the participants how THEY are going to benefit (and believe me getting a bunch of engineers or accountants to ""draw a picture"" will have them questioning how it is going to benefit them for sure), then the event is not ""productive"" for the people participating.   
So again, I was asking you in what way was the picture painting event productive for the people who took part, and why for instance networking, thinking outside the box, and ""skills not often used"" (I suppose that includes wielding a paintbrush, a very important skill to have in today's workplace) are not things that are excercised in the normal working environment in the first place.   
I mean, I don't disagree that such an event might be fun and enjoyable. I'm simply questioning what percieved value is obtained, and who percieves this value (the organizers or the attendees, for instance), and at what cost to the company, and why some companies percieve that the cost/benefit tradeoff is a good one.   
I personally think that if I never understood what these events were for it was simply because no one bothered explaining, but required me to participate by force anyway. That to me is neither motivating nor trust building, and does not contribute to the company's ""team feeling"". But again, that's just me, I might have worked at bad companies. That's why I was asking someone knowledgeable (you) to explain what these events really accomplish.   
Given how much flak I got from asking a simple, polite question (insults from peachy and impatience from you), I rather wonder if it is perhaps because you don't really know the answers yourselves.    
But I'm just speculating, of course.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: May 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Team Building Event Ideas	tammyshanker	Posts: 20

			It depends what you really want to learn. Classical massage is best for the start as it will give you very good base for other massage styles. It will be difficult for you to be good at this work if you don't learn Swedish/Classical first but maybe you want to learn only Lomi Lomi. This is also an option but if you do such course that will be all you know and you won't be able to offer any therapeutic techniques if you have someone with problems.  
Migros is offering massage courses and it does not cost a fortune but I don't know about the quality or how much you can actually learn there. 
I think online courses are good only if you already have experience and need some inspiration.    
There is only one school in Zurich where they teach in English but it does cost a fortune. I was also looking for courses in London or Dublin but finding something that requires to show up only twice a month is almost impossible.  
There are one day workshops in Gateway Workshops in London or you could start from Jing Institute in Brighton - very interesting short courses.   
I can teach you a lot if you need practice, not only paper. I have friends who will be happy to assist as guinea pigs and can give honest feedback. 
Think of how much you can pay and call me.

			It's almost certainly an organised 'urban knitting' event. Genuine, ""guerilla"" urban knitting is forbidden in most parts of Switzerland, but occasionally the local women's societies will get together and prettify a town with wool. It will remain there for a week or two weeks, then it will be removed in order to restore 'ordnung' in the town.

He's a great magician as well, so, yes, probably.   
In one trick he ended up in the piano.  I asked him what he was doing there.  He said ""I'm Haydn"".

			In order to liven things up during some of our dinner parties,  I was wondering if anyone privately performed at dinner parties or small gatherings?  Maybe playing the guitar, saxophone, keyboard, singing etc.  We do not have room for a band, since it is a small apartment, so a one or two persons band would work.  If there is any interest would you PM me with price and details.  Location is near Schwyz.  Looking for someone already on the 15th of March.  Thanks!

			Some of the stuff on that list gave me a good belly laugh - especially the part about the use of the fork and using utensils at all times even to eat fruit!  I've yet to see someone trying to eat an orange or the like with either a fork, spoon or, heaven forbid, a knife!    
As you said, a lot of it is just down to plain universal common sense anyway.   
My advice.  Just go with the flow and be yourself. Anything else will look too forced and contrived.

If you have a petite frame then it maybe worth it to go for a shopping tour to Italy.   
When I was looking for my dress in ZH it was a hassle to find a small one, and the price tags of the nicer ones equalled a mortgage.    
Finally I've bought one when I visited my relatives in Italy, they have a huge choice there, the designs are much more feminine, and in general much cheaper.    
If you google 'abiti da sposa' you'll find an endless choice.

			Indeed you have got many good suggestions, except from the one from Magick...... 
Roma is a fantastic city. In 2 days you can get a good overview of the center. 
First of all I suggest you book an affordable place in the center, so you don't have to use public transportation. Anyway subway is much better then buses. Avoid the bus N. 64, it is famous for pickpockets. A good idea could be to take one of those 2 floor tourist bus. You can choose the itinerary and then you can get in and out at each stop during a certain period (I believe 24 hrs). Walking around the center of the city is great, all main sites are pretty concentrated in a ""limited"" area, so just take your comfortable shoes with you....  
From the airport you can get the bus to the center with few Euros. Don't even think of hiring a taxi. Stay away from tourist restaurants. You can get good ""pizza a taglio"" or panini for few Euros. Don't buy anything from the mobile stalls near to the main monuments, those will overcharge you (btw they are not run by Italians....)   
Local people are generally friendly and willing to help. There are thieves and pickpockets, like in any big cities in Europe.... Roma is not different from Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, and London from that point of view. There are a lot of thieves pretending to be tourists (I can spot them immediately though...). Stay away from them, even from their children. If they get close to you chances to get robbed are high.   
You can get a lot of additional info from this web site:      
Besides, even if you travel alone you will meet a lot of Filipino-Italians in Roma. I believe Roma is one of the European cities with the highest number of Filipinos. We like them and they have been there for more than 40 years.   
If you need more info send me a PM.   
Enjoy your visit to Roma, CAPUT MUNDI!!!!!

I am not trying to be rude with you, but I highly advise you to not publicize this information and wait to take that risk yourself. There is a certain amount of ""personal"" use prescription drugs you can bring back, without their original packaging. But asking some one else to transport, what are literally drugs...drug mule? It's smuggling, literally, although I am certain it is for a good cause if it is for your Mom's health, and not to re sell.

			The battery is the most obvious and bothersome result of the spilled water but there are other issues. (Every time I start up the laptop, I get a message saying that a USB device is drawing too much power from my computer so it has been disabled. That leaves my computer with only 1 working USB port.) People who have had similar experiences have told me that minerals, etc left by the dried up water could problems to show up later on.    
Good to know though that the Genius Bar will not cost as much as getting it looked at locally. Though one of the local Apple resellers said I can rent a laptop for 125 a week while mine's getting fixed. I'll ask if the Apple Store also rents laptops. Thanks everyone!

			For the scholarship application, this page:    says that the application will be available on the 1st of November. I  remember the application having a template of exactly what you need to  write. I think it is binding.. I have a friend who is planning to try to *bend* the topic a little bit.. He is not sure he will succeed though. But I cannot give a definite answer.   
As for the GRE, I meant that as long as the scores aren't very bad (like 100 or something), then they are not taken into consideration (my scores and my friends' scores weren't impressive).   
As for my friend, she is happy with the program and the ETH in general.    
Regarding the question about the job.. I did not understand you. If you meant after finishing the masters, then probably yes if you do well in your thesis. Your professor most of the time (from what I have seen and heard) decides to keep you if he thinks you are good. If you meant to ask about a job while you study.. You can only get a part-time job. AFAIK, your student visa will not allow you to work more than 15 hours a week. A friend of mine was doing some small programming project as a Hiwi. They paid him well.   
Yes, I was an undergraduate student in Egypt at the time :-).      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Oct 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	ETH Zurich: Anyone with application experience?	BlackHoleSunn	Posts: 3

			But then again, thinking about it, if you do use new wood - it will change colour VERY quickly and look ""old"" in no time.  Rub it with yoghurt to encourage moss?   
My neighbor has a wooden house, newly built a few years ago and it looks really (horribly) old now since they never did anything to the outside wood.

Is anyone out there using these lenses or have you in the past?  Can you share your experiences with them and, if possible, the names of eye doctors in the Zurich area that supply such lenses?   
Yes, I've Googled them, and have found some info, but not a lot of specific details for Zurich.  (Might be that I'm searching in English...)

			Hello,   
In an apartment and missing a garden? How about sharing a hobby garden with us?   
We rent a hobby garden (official website  ), which is a reasonably sized allotment in a garden area in Wenkenmatten, Riehen.   
  Its a lovely place for both work and rest. Growing and harvesting your own vegetables is so rewarding, and its perfect for grilling on the long summer evenings.   
The plot is divided into four quadrants, split on two levels. On the upper, more excluded level, there is a chalet & outdoor grill in one quadrant; with an open plot beside it under the shade of a plum tree. Below, and more visible, is the one quadrant with a lovely big cherry tree, and the other quadrant is where we grow vegetables.   
We, however, are often away on business travel, and need someone to tend to the garden. Also, we are aging and admittedly not as strong as we used to be. Given that we both work, we simply cannot manage the garden on our own anymore. 
Were therefore looking for someone to share the garden with us. We will continue to cover the rental costs etc., and it comes at no cost to you, other than your time and labour.  
If you enjoy gardening, and are willing to help maintain the garden, this could be for you. Please contact us if youre interested.  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	FREE: Hobby garden (Schrebergarten) to share, Riehen	G&amp;B	Posts: 2

			I've once come to witness a similar situation from close range.   
Basically, your current boyfriend should be man enough to not take the child so far away from her real father. Sure, you can say that the father is only there during holiday periods, but he sure is still there when she needs him and during shorter holidays throughout the year - a stranger has no right to influence her life in such a radical way. Every child has his/her right to her father, no matter how much or how little involved he is in the upraising. Taking a kid away like that is taking away that little possibility.

			Newspaper can be composted quite normally. Obviously I'm not talking about bundles of it but as a wrapping it's not a problem. Printing inks today are mainly friendly not only to humans but also to the environment. Things like egg boxes can also be composted.     
Myself I simply use the small plastic bags one takes in the Migros for fruit and  stuff and use these for my compost bin liner which I then empty into the outside container and then put into my normal waste.

			Thank you to all who posted comments and suggestions! I made an official complaint to the police. All I can do now is to hope it doesn't happen again but if it does the police will have it on the their data base and they told me they may be able to do something. Strange thing is that they were not capable of finding out who the phone number belongs to as it has never been associated with any police incidents. I always thought they had much more access. Oh well. Have a great weekend to all!

			Stuff like this appears cheaper in Switzerland because of the low VAT. Often the pre-tax prices are similar across countries.    
If you're importing enough to save a couple of hundred dollars, aren't you going to lose the savings paying tax on the import?

			Depending on how many of each size / style there is, it is possible it is a sales rep's traveling / demo bag - especially if, despite the labels, they all come from the same manufacturer (such as Armani, Ray Ban, Versace, etc etc all coming from  )   
While it's hard to imagine reps being unaware of the need for donated eyewear enough to simply toss an old demo kit, it's not beyond the realm of possibility.    
Another possibility is that it's from a store that went out of business and was gutted - and the optician had also been prev rep and / or did ""house calls"" (I took a selection of frames to a nursing home once to help fit a woman who was bedridden) - and the suitcase with take-along stock got tossed with the rest of the detrius of the lost business.     
A third possibility is that the frames in question were stolen from a working business, by someone taking advantage of construction in the area (perhaps an optical store being remodeled?), chucking frames in the suitcase and suitcase in the skip to retrieve later. I'd think something like this would tend to happen more in clothing stores, but having worked in both ""retail optics"" and clothing, there were reasons why we were required to break down all the boxes headed to the garbage, and this was chief among them.   
So,   advice would be to take them to the police to make sure they're ""clean"".    would be to let me know what you've got (I need a new frame or three myself! .  ). Seriously though, let me know what you've got, I may be able to help you figure out what is worth bothering trying to sell and what to donate.     though, if you've a good heart, donation is a wonderful idea (this is something near and dear to my heart), and knowing what sorts of frames we'd sometimes get for ""free"" glasses, it would be fab to see some fashionable ones in the mix for many of the recipients.

			I am not sure if it's true, but I seem to have the best success for local flights buying just before the end of the month. I guess that most Swiss people get paid in the last week of the calendar month, so just a little earlier 5-6 weeks before flying up to about 8 weeks before flying is good.    
If you miss your flight in Basel,  I highly doubt you can board in Zurich.    
The way I check for options is to skim the arrivals board for the airport for flights from Zurich, so I would go on Manchester airport website arrivals and look for flights arriving from Zurich. That is a quick way to check what your airline options are...then I go to each airline's website and play around with dates to find the cheapest options within my travel window...

Most shops have this style on display. Many people buying a 160 bed frame buy just one mattress. It is rare to buy two, so I am wondering why it was sold that way. One reason might be one person preferring a much harder mattress than the other.

			I haven´t pursued this very intensely but what I´ve been told is that classical instrument makers are unlikely to take you as an assistant , or student because their work is so demanding that they have no time to teach someone. One guy told me: "" hey, I did 3 years of studies in Brienz ( the only accredited violin making school in CH) and I tried having people learn from me while assisting me, but they were just in the way. I´m not doing that again.""   
So, I think he saw the extra work of showing somebody as too much for the benefit of having some help.    
Perhaps knock on some doors and see if you get a good reaction.

			Every other month, you'll get a plastic bag in your letter box by a company called texaid. It looks like a bin bag, but it's actually taller and red and white. It's sent by the people who will come and collect it some days later.   
On it are the rules on what textiles and clothes are accepted when they come and collect it, so you can throw all your disposable clothes in it, and on the day of collection drop it outside the door of your house.   
The same company also has the containers mentioned in one of the posts above mine.

When we need electronic type stuff or computer parts, we've gone to either    
1.  STEG in Littauer Boden on the same roundabout as Hornbach & Otto's--they stock Apple products & lots of computer innards (Do not park in unmarked parking places!  The cops love to hand out tickets!)   
or   
2.  Conrad in Emmenbruecke between Seetalplatz & Emmen Center (there's a Denner in the same building).   
He's not at all sure either of the last two places will have your part in stock, but they may very well be able to order it or point you in the direction of a supplier.  No idea if they can help you with advice on the repair, either, but they've always been fantastic & helpful to us.   
Hope that helps!  Good luck!

			I grew up in Melbourne and moved to ZH in my mid 20s to study and have been here for 9 years. At the moment I'm currently thinking seriously about moving back to Melbourne. Most of the comments about Zurich vs Melbourne I agree with. Eg Melbourne has way better food options (esp at the lower end of the price range), better weather, friendlier locals, but worse transport, and far from other places. The main thing that seems missing in most Swiss towns is the atmosphere and liveliness present in larger cities. Your salary to living costs look pretty much equivalent for both places.   
One thing about Zurich is being located in the middle of a very large economic block (the EU) there are probably some opportunities in employment that are rarer to find in Aus - eg if you did want a change of career and wanted to move into the business side of healthcare Switzerland is a good place to do this - several large Swiss companies work in this area and lots of non-Swiss ones have their European headquarters here.   
On the which is more crowded question to me Zurich definitely feels more crowded - narrower streets, less space in homes / flats, less open space etc. Also it feels ""crowded"" in other ways - e.g. if you're looking for an flat in an interesting part of ZH, if you're looking for a place to do weekend brunch without a booking in Zurich it feels crowded - ie too many people not enough places for them.   
One thing is that depending on exactly where you end up living in Zurich you'll have a few small frustrations that are much rarer in Australia eg laundry calendars, pedantic neighbours, noisy church bells (but there are probably equivalent things in all cities).   
Generally you tend to regret things you don't do, so why not try it and see how it goes. Good luck.

			This is the time you find out who has been paying their Church Tax.   
Apparently, this includes a ""proper"" send off when you pop your clogs. maybe this includes ""paid"" mourners as well?   
For people like me and my wife who were trying to save a couple of grand a year on this, it will probably be a quick trip in a Mobility Combi to the local burning house or try and stuff the body into a 120 Litre black bag with 5 green stickers from Volg and hide it in the middle of the other rubbish sacks on a Friday morning.

			Having just seen the post about ""post-and-run"", I'm coming back to thank everyone for their input.  On the basis of the replies, we did decide to rent rather than buy or ship.   
We ended, though, up going with Geigenbauer Rast on Forchstrasse, and are extremely happy with them.     
In fact, I'm so happy with them that I would like to highly recommend Rast for anyone who has any string instrument needs.  They are clearly doing what they're doing as a labor of love.  If you go there, you must ask to see the amazing ""doll"" house.  I normally am not someone who goes for dolls or dollhouses, but this is different.

			Quick update:   
I returned the item to the store and they accepted it after doing a few checks.   
I then went to digitec and spend a few extra hundred to get something of very high quality/specs.

People that think 1.2s load times for apps is much faster than a 1.4s load time are stuck on paper. As you say, if those fractions are important, get an SSD.

I was in a similar situation. I'm South African/Swiss and when I came here they tried to sign me up. I told them I spoke no German and they said fine, don't bother with military then.   
As for matric I think it is like matura here. I was accepted into the University of Zurich masters program (though I did already have a BA from Stellenbosch). I don't think this country has a problem with SA education papers.

			Welcome to the forum, cedar!   
Well, if you work in Geneva, you pay Swiss income tax on your salary. If you live in France, the French consider that money has been taxed. Check your tax position to see how much better or worse off you'd be if you earned the same in France.   
Unfortunately, the information is not centralized in any one convenient place. It can be a jungle. Here is about as good as it gets  .    
And remember that I work in Geneva, not Vaud, and that can matter.    
I suggested joining the groupement des frontaliers NOW, especially if you're francophone. It's not too expensive & it gets you through all the initial administrative sh*t, even if you decide not to stay with them afterwards. See their web site, to see what you think.

			Hi,   
just wanted to check if anyone's kid is training in FC Seefeld or FC Zurich/letzikids?   
My son has been training in FC Seefeld since May last year, and he is quite happy with coaching, tournaments and club in general. However, now in winter time there are very few games, no tournaments and they still train only one a week.    
Training for the same age FCZ/letzikids happens to be two times a week and there are quite a few tournaments.   
Maybe it is good idea to move him to Letzikids?    
has anyone's kid been in one of those clubs? What is your experience? I am interested in experience of 8-9 year olds.     
Thank you.

I sent two e-mails asking for someone to come and give me an estimate and got no response whatsoever.  If I didn't take up their services I would expect to pay for any estimate as I know it takes time and effort to put them together.  Heck the one I got from the electricians who did our electricity rewiring ran to 11 pages!  Of course they deserve recompense for putting that sort of thing together.   
If you do know someone that would be great.  I've got to talk to OH about the cat flap idea, but it would be nice to get the windows panes done.  Does he by any chance also do window frames?  Some of the frames need attention too.

			I have some questions that are keeping me from moving forward on mailing my gifts to the United States. I'm aware of the time constrictions, and want to get them mailed out in the next few days.   
So far I understand that  
1) Value limit on imports without duty is $200, and should be marked as a gift. 
2) Hard cheeses are the only cheese that are allowed.   
My questions are 
1) What counts as hard cheese? Gruyere? Appenzeller? Raclette? 
2) If I pay for delivery in 3-7 days, will Gruyere, Appenzeller or Raclette spoil in that time? Should I invest in a styrofoam container and ice packs to make it better? (What kind of store would I find these in?) Is there any website that I can order from that will handle mailing above cheeses for me in a proper way? (I've already searched and couldn't find any). 
3) What is the procedure when I go to the Post for mailing. Do I need to have US custom forms already filled out or will they provide them to me?   
Thanks for any help! This is the first time I'm mailing anything back to the U.S. and I'm super nervous!

			Different stores have different policies. If you have just changed your mind- they don't have to take anything back- some will, within 30 days (like Migros) provided you have receipt and full and intact packaging, others won't. There is absolutely no requirement for them to do so. Try and they just might - otherwise you will have to see the tablet privately here or to friends, e-bay, etc.   
When I lived in the UK I could not believe that for some of my neighbours, buying stuff they don't need and take back to the shop was a bit of a 'hobby'. Some even used to buy clothes for parties, wear them, and return to the shop for full refund the next day- one even had an evening dress dry-cleaned before returning (: ... the 'fair and normal' customer eventually does pay for that with higher prices to cover abuse.

			Back from Bern.   
It is a nice looking city. With the river and some bridges. Was a bit cold and there was leftover snow and ice in some places.   
After the tourist info, I picked up one of those free bicycles (free rental for 4 hours) leaving the train station and went around. Even though I had a (rather poor) map of the Invader locations printed out from the net, I was only able to find 3, which left me slightly disappointed. 
At least in one instance I'm convinced the tiles were removed, because there was a conspicuous area about the right size in a different shade of the wall's colour, more or less where the map indicated there should be one of them.

So you would probably need to contact somebody in advance and explain what you want and negotiate your way from there. How far you can get depends entirely on your charm, diplomacy and negotiating skills. There is to my knowledge no place where you can just go and get stuff.

			As a  (from professional, now part time) guitar teacher, always go for someone who offers a free trial / consultation lesson, or at least pay for 1 or 2 lessons before committing to 10, otherwise how do you know what you are getting? Then when you commit to 10, both sides know it will work!     
From his point of view, he has done nothing wrong. You paid for 10, he is willing to provide 10, and if your work / stress is too much then it's not really his fault. Please bear in mind that with adults this ""not enough time situation"" really happens a lot - I stress to all my new students that they need to be 100% sure they have time to do this.      
Situation with the friend sounds odd though - to me if you found someone else to take the lessons then that is a perfect solution!     
Also if you are still looking for lessons look for a teacher who is happy to host irregular lessons, this way it will fit much better with your lifestyle and work and you will have time to improve.

What happen if you order them from abroad is that you are given a tax free allowance up to a fairly large amount (apparently 200, but I didn't check beyond the post above - see the thread I linked for the explanation). Hence, as Kri summed up, when ordering from amazon.de, the VAT is taken off.

Hi, the list might seem long, as I said before it is easier for you, as your car is not UK Right Hand Drive.   
Once you have Read down to the part      I would imagine it would be the same for Greek Plates, providing you have relevant Greek Insurance & Greek Road taxes during any part of those 12 Months until you have time to organise getting it imported.   
The list will seem long, because ""CRAN"" has taken the time to list almost every detail if not all of what was involved for CRAN.   
Saves you some hundreds/thousands of a private company doing it for you.

			Unsure of Berne, but in many Gemeindes / Stadts in Canton Zurich, there are special programmes under Asyl Koordination / Sozialdienste departments that a person with elementary German and perhaps with English can contribute to.    
Such programmes are run by private organisations with support of both departments and deal with asylum seekers, refugee integration (   ) as well as assisting the youth groups and perhaps one can also be an observer in classes (   ) and then volunteer subsequently as the level of German increases.

I'm an English painter who moved to Zürich last month. Does anyone know of any artist groups/collectives in the area that I could get involved with?   
Also, if anyone is interested in attending openings and not being the solitary figure in the corner let me know.

			Ok ..since I did not receive the vignette yet, I cannot put my stuff outside tomorrow. I desperately need to get rid of some stuff... So I'll apply(site mentioned in original post) again for next week. I still have no idea how to get multiple vignettes... apply multiple times  ?    
Their site does not provide the information I need and ...due to my bad German I am unable to get any information by calling their contact number. When I last called, I just about managed to make out that plastic is ok and metal is not   . Today when I called I just heard recorded messages in German, which of course I could not understand  .    
Ok ..so I need to learn German. But before that I need to get rid of my stuff. I dont drive, so I have to use their pick up service. Help !!! Need info !

			As noted above, go to the police or municipal authorities where you want this to occurr.  You need permission, typcially at least one month in advance.   
I think approval or demonstrating without approval depends on a lot of things.  Do you plan to disrupt public transport?, or otherwise block public services, then indeed it may not be granted.  Otherwise, if it is well planned and within the norms it should be acceptable.

			I am in exactly the same position as you now! Well, almost. I have just finished a business degree, am 22 years old and would love to study architecture. I also used to be a really good student, and actually have the required points to get in to EPFL, but sadly did not take Physics or Chemistry in high school, which is a big mistake of mine. Therefore, I have to take the admission exam reduit, which is all the hard physics and chemistry which I have never really studied. And the exam is in a little over 2 months, so I don't really feel that I have a chance at all.   
I just wish I had seen this earlier. So did you end up taking the exam? Did you get in?

			If you're into second hand clothing, you could try the flea markets. There's a pretty good one at helvetiaplatz every Saturday morning, though it tends to be better when the weather's nicer. There are often people there who are just selling things from their house as a one-off.   
Also, look for brockenhaus or brocki. They are the cheap second hand shops. Stores that call themselves 'second hand' are usually only designer clothes that are still very expensive. 
A good thrift store is Brocki-land. It's in an old parking garage, and pretty much everything there is 3CHF. It's a bit harder to find clothes there, since they organize it by color instead of style, but it is cheap.

Just thought I'd pass on a decent hairdresser....well from a male prospective lol   
He's in Saint Louis on the main road from the border crossing, about 1/2 mile on right or the 3rd bus stop on the 604 from Schlifflande once in France..   
He's called Deniz, I think......it's 15 Euro for wash, cut, style......which I thought maybe cheap and cheerful but he's a very good barber and even my wife approved !! who discovered that it is almost as expensive to have it done in Basel than a return flight to the states (actually true)   
Beware that the French still shut for lunch.....but since he's 100m from the main crossroads he was quiet..   
Doesn't speak a word of English but we discussed football nonetheless !!!

More precisely, the Springbär is distantly related to the Australian drop bear,  , a marsupial in the koala family (which, like the koala, is not actually a bear). These animals are rare. but unfortunately vicious attacks on humans have occurred, although the severity has been exaggerated; no human fatalities have ever been recorded.   
For some reason, the myth that drop bears are themselves mythical persists, despite the  . The fact that drop bears have not killed any humans, yet stories abound of their exaggerated danger, probably leads many to believe that drop bears themselves are made up. The ""myth"" myth was perpetuated by the classic Bundaberg Rum TV advertisement of 2004 which seemed to make a joke of drop bears:      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Nov 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	A tree question	shall	Posts: 31

			You could see if the Swiss reseller/distributor can order one with a UK keyboard - that's what I did when I got my Dell was very easy.   
If you order from the UK then they might be able to sell it to you without the VAT depends how they are set up   
Another option get it delivered to   or similar then bring it across yourself.

			Another idea - I don't know if there's an equivalent in the Geneva/Lausanne area or not, but up here in the German-speaking part the free tabloid paper   has an SMS shoutout column inside the back cover, missed connections and so on. Judging from the contents it seems to be mostly young people who post there - might be worth a try.  
(Again though, no news wouldn't necessarily be bad news, could just mean she hadn't seen it or that for reasons of her own she chose not to respond.)   
Seriously, the only people I can imagine might have reliable information on her whereabouts will be: 
1) local government. Any change of address has to be registered with local authorities within 10 days. Good luck getting them to tell   though.   
2) the police, who can get access to local government records if you convince them there's a problem. Normally they wouldn't do anything to trace her (adults have the right to not-contact anyone they like) but since there's a young child involved they might. You won't be told anything though (not even a simple ""we found her, she's OK"") unless she wants you to be told.   
3) her employer, who should have a valid address for her and should at least know whether she is still showing up for work, responding to work emails etc. (This is assuming that she's over here for work - of course if she was on leave they wouldn't necessarily know where she'd gone or expect answers to emails.)    
4) her professional contacts: hairdresser, kid's daycare etc. etc. Given that she hasn't been here very long, these are unlikely to be much help.   
5) her current social contacts, even if not old friends. Did she mention meeting new people recently, add some new FB friends etc.? Reach out to some of those people. Again, keep the information you request to an absolute minimum, insist that you   trying to establish any sort of contact, and you'll probably find people more more willing to help.

Wizo - Güterstr. 218 - 4053 Basel  (061 361 25 33) 
Sahara - Gerbergasse 20/1 - 4001 Basel  (061 262 20 47) 
There's another one on Lindenberg (that's the street name) in Klein Basel that i don't remember the name of. It doesn't have typical shop windows, looking more like a bottom flat converted into a shop.   
I've never personally sold anything to any of them, only bought the odd piece of clothing there, so i don't know if they're picky in terms of what clothes they'll take. I guess they're selling clothes on a consignment basis, 
because that's what most of those 2nd hand clothes shops do, but then you could give them a buzz and ask to find out (""nehmen sie Kleider auf Kommission?"")

			Hi, 
My son wants to have a football match with his mates on his birthday. The only problem is that I cannot find a place where they can have a game in January.  
I've tried to rent sportshall for couple of hours in our community centre but is not possible. school is not keen either to let us use school's turnhalle for a game.   
Any suggestions?   
Thanks

I've just moved to Uster and my daughter is coming up to 3 years old in January.  I'm looking to find some playgroups and more friends for her.

I learnt in Switzerland as a child, the continental or German method- MIL of course knitted the UK way - and was adamant it was much better and quicker (NOT!)    
How do people in the USA knit btw? Watch out if using a pattern. the UK and continental method with the same number of stitches, needles and tension, do NOT work out identical in width of garment!

			I buy wool from www. deramores.com they have lots of brands on there and it only costs £6.95 for delivery which isnt that bad. Or is you would prefer worsted weight yarn you can order from   which is about $14.99 delivery to here. They have many brands to choose from also. Just keep below the custom amount.    
I found with postage costs these sites were better value than on ebay although I use ebay to buy ribbons and buttons etc. If I need something to hand as mentioned before manor has some cheaper wool and it is actually really soft.

			A little off the subject, only because the weather is getting colder and I assume others are in search of warm suggestions - another option to an electric blanket is something from the US called a slanket.  It's an oversized blanket with sleeves and looks to be uber comfortable, especially when just playing on the computer (something I know many on the forum are guilty of!  )    
Here is the webite:

I know many will laugh, but what can I say? I'm a big baby when it comes to being warm and comfy in the winter!

			For stability reasons (depending on your activity level in bed  ), I would suggest you go for the 10 cm x 10 cm blocks.    
You will want to put felt padding (or the little round felt pads) under the blocks so they do not scratch the floor.   
Jumbo has some in very hard wood. They will cut them for you as well.

			I've no doubt for some people it works well. It has for us, mostly. The problem is the lack of a sensible route of ending the contract.

			You can use just a booster but a full car seat is more stable and safer.     
She is going to be needing a car seat until approxmately age 10 (it goes on height but it is around age 10 most kids grow tall enough) so although it might seem like an expense, it's something  she'll use for a long while.    
We keep a couple of seat only boosters to give to friends/relatives if children are ever taken in someone else's car (you can get them for as cheap as 12- 15 chfs) but have an isofix full car seat fixed in our own car for everyday use.

			Using the ""Personal Loan (BETA)"" on Comparis for 1100 over 6 months gives me results from money-net (5.8%), credit-now (which is what digitec calculator links to, 9.9%-13.9%) etc.   
Although the monthly rate on money-ney is 186 compared to 190 on the credit-now calculator that digitec shows   which is about 25 CHF savings...   
It's not that I need a loan, I can pay for the laptop but I'd rather pay it off over several months - of course with the least interest rate.   
Should I really use a loan in this sense? I don't need that much money and it's mainly to stretch out the payment and then to buy another laptop in 1-2 months for myself... which would be much higher spec'd as I need it for programming + virtual machines + gaming - although I don't mind waiting 3-4 months and then buying my own laptop after (without using this financing option / loan for first laptop)

			Fezza, what kind of training do you want to offer? What is your business model?   
General training? Sports? Behavior rehab? The SKN? Something else? This will determine what you should likely do.   
A little more info would help us point you in the right direction.   
ETA:   
Fezza, according to this thread from 4 months ago   you have never owned a dog before.    
To be blunt, you need a LOT of experience with your own dog, as well as with many other dogs in varying situations, before you should even think of becoming a professional dog trainer . The academic end of canine behavior science must be supported by practical hands on knowledge. Clients expect a trainer to have in-depth experience - that afterall is what they pay for.

			One way to get around the CH postage is to use an app or website such as Touchnote.  You upload your photo, add a caption if you want and type out the text/address etc to be included on the back.  If you buy a pack, they work out to be under 1chf each (including card and postage!), and they post outside of CH, so if you´re sending to UK, Australia, USA, the cards arrive mostly in under 3 days (really great if you forgot a birthday until the last minute!!). 
I know, the typed message on the back isn´t as personal, but you can put a photo of yourself on the front instead   Plus, you can send it while you´re sitting in the train!

There is a pedicure place on Hegibachstrasse, up the street about 2 minutes from Hegibachplatz. However, I've never actually seen it open which means they are not open on Saturday and only during the days on weekdays. So therefore does nothing for me.   
Can anyone tell me any place to get a spa pedicure that is under CHF 50?

			Thanks to everyone replying. Yes after the first month I complained about the lack of results and i had several calls with the manager who kept saying basically that I signed a contract and that I have to pay - period.    
We had agreed by phone I would go back to speak in person sometime in sept/oct as i was traveling for work and for holidays over the summer.    
The letter was mailed to me on Sept 27th. So I guess I will pay the 800CHF and try to dispute the rest.

			I second  ""Rien ne va plus"" on Oberdorfstrasse 34. Also Mr. Pinocchio further up (more of a toy shop) at Oberdorfstr. 3.   
I saw a nice chess/boardgame shop in Mulhouse the other week. Can't find the address though.   
Also in Basel:    
I bought my magnetic travel set on Ebay. It was about £2 and £2 postage!

			Hotel Krone is the cheapest, but its not that nice, so I wouldn't actually recommend it.    
I've stayed in Xtra near Limmatplatz and that was okay.  
Du Theatre is a hotel near the tram station ""central"" and I think that was by far the nicest hotel.

			Thanks a lot for the feedback, guys!  It was a Swiss shop, but I guess it is just some lady selling products from her home, which is why she was able to contact me on a Saturday evening.  After reading your replies, I contacted her and said that I will return the goods at my own cost.  I haven't paid for it yet, I was sent a bill with the package.  I think because she was so mean to be, that I really, *really* wanted to be in the right, but I guess you can't win them all ;-)

			Purely from my experience of advertising clothing and shoes 3 times on it, my opinion is that it's crap with a capital K.   
I then shifted the items to the paid-for Ricardo site and they went within the bidding period.   
Maybe you'll have more luck than I did but that's my opinion of it.

			Mods, this is not a request for employment which is why I have put it in the general forum.   
I am in Switzerland for a couple of months and have a little spare time available if anyone would like some help with their website. 
I have developed a few websites of my own in the past using PHP and would like to help a small business to get a web presence or get more visitors.  
This would be on an informal basis and I would not need paying as long as it did not take up too much time.  
I dont speak much French and am living in Vevey from 24th September.

			Hi Carlos and anna, thanks for the tips!   
I dropped by Grauwiler Mode (Fischmarkt 5, sort of between Marktplatz and Schifflände) today because they sold some nice looking suits etc and thought they might have some idea. No bloody help at all as it turns out, must have caught them on a bad day.   
I'll first try that place anna mentioned for the cleaning and then follow up Carlos' suggestion to go Turk hunting on Bruderholzstr. May as well spread the love.

			I spoke with another person in CH who had a service like this.  The only problem was that upon arrival to CH, they had to pay the 30chf import tax.  On some items that cost significantly less!   
I have just given the burden to a friend who opens and repacks my boxes so items do not look new, and ships them as ""gifts"".  In just 10 months I've saved myself some 300 chf on importing.

We've not met up yet, and I still don't have my violin for the next couple of weeks. How easy is it for you to get to Bern / Fribourg? I may be able to book a room somewhere at the University of Bern which we could use every couple of weeks, if that looks like the best place for everyone?

A Type 12 plug will not fit into the laptop power supply as it is supposed to go into the wall socket. The other end is known as C13.  
The C13 end may or may not fit in your particular power supply.   
Also very common are power supplies with C6 sockets which need a plug C5 aka Mickey Mouse     
or ones with a C8 socket which needs a C7 plug aka figure-8       
About raw plugs: You can get them in Migros/Coop/Interdiscount/Jumbo/Obi/bauhaus and many other places. Very common.   
About surge protectors: I know just one single guy who got his equipment fried from a lightning strike. Brown outs are very rare and black outs make it to the national headlines. (O.k. they are not that rare, but very very uncommon). Weclomed to the civilised world.

It's more common in France than in CH I think where quite a few people in the area I live help each other out with trips back to the UK etc.  As I said, I don't know if it's the appropriate place to post this and apologise if I've got it wrong....

Does anyone know of a shop?

			hello all   
I found this website which covers the European labour market.  It has useful contacts who can provide information for cross boarder workers about benefits and entitlements and has list of contacts.  I just spoke to one of the representatives in Basel and he was very helpful.       
""EURES offers a network of advisers to provide the information  required by   jobseekers and employers through personal contacts. There  are more than 850   EURES advisers across Europe and the number is  growing. 
 EURES advisers are trained specialists who provide the three basic  EURES services   of information, guidance and placement, to both  jobseekers and employers interested   in the European job market. They  have developed specialised expertise in the   practical, legal and  administrative matters relating to mobility at national   and  cross-border levels. They work within the Public Employment Service of    each member country, or within other partner organisations in the EURES  network. 
 To find a EURES adviser in your country or your cross-border region,  use the search form below. You can contact the EURES advisers by email  or by phone. Please note that our advisers have a busy schedule and  emails could take a while to get answered""

			Hi everyone,   
I am putting on a big breakfast event next week, and would really like to be able to offer freshly made waffles and pancakes/crepes! We don't have access to a hob, however, so was hoping there would be someone out there who knows someone who's mum has a crepe-stone or waffle maker/iron which I could rent out for a day? Would be happy to collect and return.   
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

			Also, postal workers (not to mention customers) have different levels of competence with (and maybe more importantly, willingness to deal with) English, since English isn't an official language of Switzerland.     
I spent a long time perusing the Swiss Post website before heading to the post office for the first time.  Unfortunately I didn't know to look for descriptions of A-post vs. B-post (no such distinction where I'm from).  So I didn't find out till a little bit too late what A-post and B-post even were, and thus that I was going to be asked which I wanted when I got to the front of the line.   So there I was standing at the counter having no idea what I was being asked (in German -- I'm just reconstructing what must have happened, since I still don't really know).  Fortunately they just ended up choosing one for me and fortunately it was only a few rappen difference rather than multiple francs as I assume a similar choice would be if I were posting a package internationally.     
The part about taking a number and looking for a ""Schalter"" would also not be obvious to people from different parts of the world, though I did figure that out pretty soon.     
Reminds me of the SBB guy who thought it was obvious that everyone in all countries of the world are always required to carry their identity papers with them at all times.  He looked like he really thought this was true.

			I went to the same ""issue"". I changed the original regulator with a german one marked 50mbar. I don't think there are safety issues. the only problem I have the impression that I get higher gas flow on the grill. so at the minimum settings the fire is still pretty high. So I am thinking about going to jumbo and get a 30mbar.

In practice the mains voltage isn't 100% reliable anyway, and a heavy drain on one circuit could cause a voltage drop further 'down' the line, so nothing so sensitive would have coped anyway.   
So yes, not only will they work OK, but they'll almost certainly be operating within manufacturer tolerances.   
Then again, your given location seems to be in the land of 110v, so care must be taken if that's the case. Euro appliances don't work well with that nasty transatlantic elecktrickery.  "	earned some respect	Join Date: Jun 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Hair Clippers 240V 50 Hz	rob2681	Posts: 47

			Your bags should be checked through to Rome, I think.   
If you don't want to lug your carry-on baggage, then use the lockers in the Zurich Airport - they are on the bottom floor, close to the escalators that lead to the train tracks.   
You oughta have plenty of time to check out Zurich - 3 hours should be enough if you stick around between the old town and the lake.  Cross your fingers for good weather though!

Our son who is thirteen now did it two years ago so when he was 11. He did his on the roads near his school but for the children who go to school in the town centre and other built up/ busy traffic areas they set up a 'pretend'  road layout on a large square in Neuchatel centre. The children learn the rules of the road etc on the 'safe' road before being taken out on the 'real' roads nearby to put the theory into practise. 
They get a certificate at the end if they pass all the different parts of the test.   
Our son had already done it the previous year just before we moved here from Belgium and had done a fair bit of road cycling too so he had no problems passing but his friend failed ( mind you he did go the wrong way up a one way street.   
I guess at 12 the OP's son will have already missed the school courses as they tend to be done at around 10/11

			Economical music-related items in Switzerland? Forget it. I just bought a set of ear protectors for 8 pounds in the UK after seeing the same pair for 45.- in Lausanne.    
As previously mentioned, Hug is quite large, although if they don't have Kun rests I'd try one of Lausanne's many luthiers. I quite like Mastrangelo, Rue de Bourg 27, although I know there is a good one at Rue Neuve 9 as well.    
And in case you ever need to get a bow restrung, the work done by Mastrangelo is superb.

I left behind a slightly older model of the Whirlpool you're considering in the US and I loved it (and the matching dryer). I do miss the speed with which I could wash massive loads of laundry, but I do appreciate the eco aspect of my Swiss machine (though not when I'm on my third load of the day).

			Appreciate the few feedbacks.  It's a floor lamp in the corner of the living room.  The one and only old 3-way fixture we brought with us from the states.   
We could do something fancy, as suggested, but if the Swiss didn't have these special 3-way bulbs then we just slap normal bulbs into it.  Seeing how it's just plugged into an outlet that's activated by a wall switch it's no biggie.   
A friends suggested getting US 3-ways, the plug the lamp into a 240 to 120V converter.  That'd really be super energy efficient wouldn't it...    
Thanks again!

As its a pet there is a tax percentage but they wave me through when I have asked before.

			Hmm, SG is relatively far away, but much closer than Zurich.    
Steg electronics has a great selection and warranty, I see. Shipping from them is the way to go, yes. How is people's experience with their warranty? 36 months is very nice for a CPU, for example.   
Just in case, anything else closer to Buchs SG, say when I need a hard drive or new monitor, things that are best picked up instead of shipped?    
Imagine getting by train or bus with a computer case box, monitor, and the rest...

			I have just had an email to say the next course is available   
""You have a short or a long time before the course ""Live in Zurich"" in German, English, Spanish or visited in another language. You have praised the course and many of you would have liked to have been aware of before. You are the best advertising medium for us inside. Therefore, we ask you to recommend the course as many friends and girlfriends on. Be it verbally or by e-mail or Facebook, etc. The next course starts on 18th September and lasts until 18 December 2013 will be held usually on Wednesday morning. New from 8:45 bis 11:15 clock. In the appendix we will send you a flyer, as well as a small advertising poster that their ""post"" at most in Facebook can!   
I thank you sincerely for your support and look forward to hearing from you or seeing you again and again!   
With warm regards,""   
I have included the link to the website so you can see the flyer in English        
Hope this helps some newcomers to Zurich

			I assume you mean Zalando?   
I have ordered multiple times with them and have always been pleased. When not pleased I return item. Shipping and returning is ""free"" (I mean for sure it is included in the price somewhere but somehow psychologically feels better that way   )   
You have 30 days to return items, which is handy if you order multiples and want to ponder a bit    
I have compared prices of kids shoes and they have good deals.   
They also often have voucher for 10 CHF off here and there so I have hardly ever paid full price.   
One watchout: lately I noticed they started playing the Swiss game of increasing prices MASSIVELY for CH clients. I have complained to their client service about this and did not buy said item.   
But I will definitely shop there again!   
Cheers, 
K

			Time Magazine Subscription in Switzerland.   
Has anyone subscribed to TIME or Fortune Magazine in CH ? 
We are planning to subscribe both. 
As we live close to FR/DE border, the question is : If it's cheap across the border to buy in a Railway Kiosk or Bookstore, why pay a expensive subscription from Switzerland ?

			Outdoor wedding will be a perfect wedding venue will definitely make a dream wedding and an unforgettable experience. while arranging for our wedding party what we care most is the appearance of the venue, bride/grooms dresses, and music. While something as important as   must be concerned about on the first place, it often comes at the last.

			As there's no general Forum for Legal matters, is this the best place to post specific legal enquiries?   
Looking for a recommendation for French/English-speaking Geneva-based lawyer who can review an ongoing situation with Company X and write a legal letter in French to try and get things moving or our money back.   
Company X (a well-known local firm with a long list of alledged recommendations) have entered into an agreement to design and build a porch at our house, are currently 2 months behind the originally agreed installation date, and currently have declined to communicate with us for the last month (no emails replied to). They have more then 50% of the money upfront, haven't given us any indication they are going to complete the work (we're still waiting on a technical drawing to review and approve)and they decline to return the money.   
Having originally engaged us through an English-speaking representative, any brief comms from them have only been by telephone in French, which we can can barely understand. The English-speaking representative has been promised by Company X to call us back for the last month, but no joy. We suspect this is deliberate.   
We have the full email trail available for review to anyone competetant to be engaged for this initial task.   
Thanks.

			Thanks for the above - I will try somewhere on Freistrasse. It is almost 7 years old (second engagement ring) and I think the wife was trying to get a 3rd from me   she was very lucky to have found it given diamonds are not too big.   
The ring actually has 3 claws (in the shape of a triangle) so not great at supporting the diamond at all, but is the first time it has ever come out of the claws.

			There are a few secrets I know to student eating in ZH:   
1) Avoid meat unless it has a nice red sticker with ""25%"" or ""50%"" on it. They do this late in the day on what will expire and also before holidays and Sunday. Coop is better for this. At some stores they have a specific discount area.   
2) Migro Budget Products - ok, finding something in the fridge becomes like a lion picking out one zebra from the herd, but the stuff is cheap and great quality for the price.   
3) Tuna Pesto. Fantastic meal. Need canned pesto (the coop brand is pretty good and not so expensive, about 3Fr), 1 can tuna (1Fr, packed in water), pasta (Migro Budget Penne are the choice here - 1.10Fr I think). Cook pasta, mix tuna and half a jar of pesto in a bowl, add pasta (it will heat up the pesto). total cost: < 3Fr.   
4) The chinese supermarket near Kalbreite tramstop (from the stop walk away from town and take the first right, it is one builting in on the right) - You can get big bags of shrimp for 15-20Fr that will last quite a few stir frys and curries. Also they have these ""Gelatenous Rice Balls"" filled with either peanut (my favorite) or something else which are relatviely cheap, super tasty and surprisingly filling (see the frozen foods near the cash).   
5) I you do want to eat out, go for a kebab!

			I definitely recommend Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" series, I'm currently halfway through book two and loving it! 
Book one was published as ""Crosstitch"" in UK and ""Outlander"" in USA, book two is ""Dragonfly in amber"".         
""The Second Chance Café"" - Alison Kent   
""Fame"" and ""Do Not Disturb"" - Tilly Bagshawe (standalone books)   
""Etiquette for the End of the World"" - Jeanne Martinet   
""Attachments"" - Rainbow Rowell    
""Ape House"" - Sarah Gruen (author of ""Water for elephants"")   
Anything Kate Furnivall: ""The red scarf"", ""The white pearl"" ""The Russian Concubine"", ""The Concubine's Secret"", ""The Jewel of St. Petersburg"" (the last three are a series and this is the publication order)   
""The Shadowy Horses"" - Susanna Kearsley (not strictly chick lit, a bit of mystery thrown in too)   
""The night circus"" - Erin Morgenstern (not strictly chick lit, a bit of fantasy)     
If anyone liked the recommendations, maybe you'd want to check my Pinterest book board (link  )for future reference, I keep adding everything I read... (not only chick lit books though).

			IKEA has a wide variety of Ziploc-type bags. They come in 2 types: 1.2L/2.5L or 4.5L/6L. Very helpful and VERY cheap. I think a box of 50 bags runs something like 3.50 CHF. I highly recommend them. They are just as durable at the ""real"" brand.   
Well, I *just* saw that these bags were mentioned above, but oh well. I still would recommend them! They were found in the kitchen section near the baking supplies. I'm not sure if they are still there now that IKEA got a bit of a face-lift.

			Hi everybody,   
The same thing happened to me of course.... I called them twice and they kept telling me that their lawyer was dealing with it. Two months later as I had no news, I called them again and had to threaten them over the phone saying that it was unacceptable to treat customers like this and ask them to deal directly with THEIR provider. 40mns later, I was reimbursed of the 20%. 
I am still missing the remaining 80%, but I intend to sue them and they are aware of my intentions. DeinDeal is responsible for the providers they choose, and we paid DeinDeal, not the provider. 
If anyone wants to join in, we could intend a class action. 
Let me know.

I am currently developing my first proper iOS app, however what I am trying to do is much more complicated than the relatively simple card-matching/recipe-book apps I have practised making previously.   
I would be really grateful if any of you experienced developers out there could answer a few questions I have regarding some more complex features (location matching, in-app messaging etc) - I'm sure there are loads of things I need to be aware of and probably some more elegant solutions already available online.

			Can anyone recommend a good sunless tanner/fake tan brand you can get here?    
Could be a cream/mousse/spray, etc- something you've tried and you know works (esp on pale skin) that won't look orange or streaky and all that..   
Also one that works well on the face if anyone knows of..   
Also has anyone tried LaRoche-Posay Autohelios? If so, do you recommend it?

2219	09.07.2013, 09:44	Senior Member	Thanked 369 Times in 142 Posts	Location: BE	"    Yes, I have some ideas will list them here, and if internet links are not clear please ask so I write more details   
For Sohour (early morning meal).   
1)   (milk with dates, or water with dates and dried fruits), this helps a lot - all what you need to do is to put a couple of pieces of palm dates in milk and keep it in the fridge from evening till Sohour time, some adds to it some dried fruits as well.   
2) Muesli with nuts and yogurt - as a source of fiber and slowly being digested.   
3) if he has no problem with gaining weight, then jam and butter will help much.   
4) Feta cheese with tomatoes and green salad with little of olive oil (like the greek salad I think).   
5)   with milk: kind of tiny pasta made with milk and butter and sugar, you will need to cut spagetti (if you dont find shareya) in small pices and mix it on fire with butter for few seconds till it gets light brown color then add some sugar or honey and when it gets a bit darker brown add some milk.   
6) In Egypt most of the people eat  , it is too heavy but stays long until being digested, as well brown lintels but this makes one thursty and not recommended in summer, if he will try them, then he has to have yogurt after it and another drink that I am not sure about the english name but it may be   this drink really acts like magic, reduces thursty in hot weather.   
I have as well a couple of suggestions for the evening meal (Iftar)   
1)  (Stuffed Zucchini with rice, and herbs). this can be served with chicken fillet and salad.   
2) Rice in Saudi arabian way, Rice with Curry and spices served with chicken cut into small pieced made in tomato sauce and onions.   
3) I found  one Iftar idea, but it is heavy especially with the soup

			It is much cheaper to go up the Niessen mountain, there is a nice restaurant at the top 2'338 meters, and fewer tourists.    
BLS are 100 years old this year and are selling cheap regional day tickets (Sfr 38,--) and cheaper return tickets for the funicular. Parking at the bottom next to the station at Mühlenen is easy, trains run every 30 minutes, you change to the second section train halfway up.                                    valid for all BLS, including ships        
In the afternoon, you could take a ship from Interlaken Ost 13:07 to Brienz 14:20 and return, arriving Interlaken at 15:53,

			Hi all.  This is a great forum; I wish I had taken advantage of resources like this when I lived abroad.  Here's my round-about request:   
So, I used to live in a village on the S8 line outside of Zürich, but have returned to the US.  I'm a writer and right now I'm working on a manuscript (fiction) that takes place in--surprise!--a small town outside of Zürich.     
But I've run into a couple of issues, things in the manuscript that cover experiences I know absolutely nothing about (things to do with children, particular incidences of bureaucracy that I didn't personally have to deal with, things along those lines).     
What I'm looking for is a couple of people who would be willing to Skype with me and just talk me through some of the universal (not personal) specifics of these experiences.     
I should make it clear--  ; my book's written.  What I AM looking to do is iron out some details so that as the book wends towards print, I don't find myself dreading the inevitable backlash of 'um, that's not right!' from people like... well, y'all.  It's good to get these things right.   
(Though-- and this might be your experience too-- I've found that in America, I can get away with saying almost anything about Switzerland; it's not a country that most people know that much about off the top of their heads (that, or my friends just aren't so bright).)    
It'd be   helpful to chat with an American woman, late 30s, early 40s, who perhaps has lived in the  Zürich area (maybe even a wee town on the S8 line!) for ten or so years.     
I hope this request isn't too odd or elliptical-- again, I'm not looking to render anyone's personal story (I harp a bit on this lest anyone worry that I'm out for something else).  What I am looking for is a more complete understanding of an American woman's experience of a few mundanities of day-to-day life in Switzerland, things that I wasn't privvy to when I was a resident.     
If this is something you might be interested in helping me with-- or if you're just bored and want to talk about dumb old American junk--  and I can tell you some more about myself and my other work, and give you some information about this project and answer any questions you might have for me;  I don't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable or ill-at-ease.    
I hope all is well and everyone's ready for their day off on Thursday!   
Thanks in advance for your time,   
Jill

			I think there is a framing shop in Zug. It is at the back of where the Coop City was (the building they are now refurbishing), you need to walk through a little alley and there it is. I think you can also find it if you walk from the Nespresso shop in Zug (on your right hand) under the bridge and then go left. 
I haven't been there so no idea of the service or cost.

			When I moved here, I shipped all my books over using the US ultra-cheap surface mail (m-bag) rate. It didn't occur to me that CH wouldn't have a similar thing. Now, I'm not leaving for another year, but it's already on my mind wondering how I'm going to get things home. It seems a bit silly (and expensive) to hire a moving company--I have less than 1 m^3 and I don't have a company picking up the bill.    
I noticed that the Italian and German posts both have surface mail (not surprising, considering they both have a coastline...)--any idea if I could just drive over to Freiburg, DE, walk into the post and ship all my stuff? I don't have a return address in DE--would that be a problem?   
Any other clever ideas??

			Hilarious... suddenly all the interest. I have long solved my problems.   
As far as plumbing supplies were concerned the answer is Sanitas Troesch. They have various outlets, including Zürich and Winterthur. That is a real trade dealer, was just the answer.   
Conrad is, of course, an option, but they are hardly what I would call a trade outlet. Their prices are ridiculous and the 'trade' folk definitely aren't buying there. I was meaning to find a real trade dealer where I could buy large rolls of electrical cable, or light switches in 20 different designs etc.   
The Pusterla website was appalling, and after about 20 seconds I gave up trying to use their catalogue. Obviously not a serious company that actually wants to attract customers. They should either rehash the website or just remove it from online.   
And yes... yellow pages. Been there, done that.   
For future readers of this thread, I also recommend trying renovero.ch 
It is a trade database. A bot hit and miss on some stuff, but you do find a few gems amongst it.   
Thanks for your responses everyone.

			Based on my work experience in the UK you need to make sure that when you ship it you declare as a temporary export for a warranty repair, and ensure that when it is shipped back to you it is declared as warranty return and that the relevant warranty repair documentation is included.   
That's the answer to your question but not to your problem, unless the smartphone is valued at under 300CHF you should have officially exported it from Spain, then declared it when you entered Switzerland and paid the requisite duty and tax, and then at some point reclaimed the tax you paid on it in Spain.    
The reality now is that you will probably get stung for duty and tax when it is returned unless you can prove that you have owned it for more than 6 months prior to moving to Switzerland, which is highly unlikely as the warranty paperwork will no doubt include purchase date.   
Your best solution is to try and get it repaired through a manufacturers agent in Switzerland, warranties are usually international.   
Not the answer you wanted but I believe what I have stated is correct there may be some here that know better.

			I was curious, so I looked up Limoges on a map - not terribly far from geneva.    
Have you thought to take a train ride to Limoges and check them out yourself? Or if your daughter's around, take her? Might be cool to see them make them. Looks like you can get from Lyon to Limoges pretty easily (and Geneva to Lyon, of course).    
or look here....

			Depends who the carrier is.  The post office takes it back to the post office, leaves a note in your post box and you have 7 days to collect.

			I go back and forth between l'occitane  and lush. I'm unfamiliar with Liz Earle, so don't know what to compare it to. I use some of the angelica products from l'occitane - they're not terribly heavy or greasy. The immortale line is good too, a bit expensive, but has a weird smell. I also like lush face cream, my favorite is ""gorgeous"", it's very creamy, maybe too heavy for younger skin. It is expensive....i buy lush in the UK where some items are as much as 30% less.

			My kids usually only speak English to each other (and me), even if in a situation where everyone else is speaking Italian.   
With their friends it's always Italian, except for one with whom my younger daughter sometimes speaks English so she (the friend) can practice, or French (so my daughter can practice).   
They are adult now, but I never notice different behavior based on language.

			Hi Ros   
Wow when I asked for help I had no idea I'd get so much great help so fast! Very much appreciated. I'm still a newbie here but I hope I can help you in return sometime.   
Thanks also for your offer of further assistance. I have functional ""high"" german (I can food shop, navigate menus, transport, the post office etc - but technical things I am a bit lost). It took me quite a while to source tools for silversmithing, even in Australia, so in Zurich I had no idea where to start.   
It's good to know I can keep this hobby going. I always prefer to find out if I'm doing something wrong before attempting to do it    
I also got a reply (super fast) from an email to the shop from the link Uncle Max sent. I was a bit concerned about bothering someone who makes jewelry for a living, but got the following lovely reply within about an hour:      I know I'll be visiting his store when I want to buy a finished piece. So nice and so helpful!    
Thanks again for everyone's help and I hope these links help anyone else interested in a really fun hobby.

			It depends on the quality you are looking for and weather it is worth the trip for the saving you can make. Locally Landi is worth a look, especially for chairs, I think the quality/price ratio is a bit above Coop Obi ect. Or if you are looking for something high quality, I make a range of outdoor furniture which is comparable in price to the bigger players here. See   for a couple of examples showing the style, but I make to order so there is flexibility on size and style.

Doing it your self at home, with some strips, it may be a bit cheaper. But I never bought the thing or the strips, so someone else may be better informed.

			Hi everyone!   
My name is Toni and I've just finished my Physics Bachelor in Barcelona. This September I'll move to Zurich, to study the physics master in the ETH.    
I have just joined this forum, as I have seen there is a lot of activity and a lot of interesting information, it would be great getting to know people studying at the ETH and other people from Zurich!   
I have some specific doubts, although I have read quite a lot from similar threads.    
1) First and most important is about housing. Although ETH offers some rooms for international students, most people have to find a room by themselves, and I will probably have to do so. People usually talk about coming a month before the beginning of lectures. Is it easy to contact landlords and others in a weekend of August? Is it really essential or would it be OK coming two weeks before? (first days of September) And what is usually a better deal, a place near the ETH Hönggerberg, or a place near the center of the city from which I can easily take public transport? I wouldn't like to live far from the city life.   
2) I have a basic standard German level (B1, although not really fluent), how easy will it be getting to understand the Zurich dialect? I have no problems with English, and I've read it's easy to live in Zurich only with it, but I wouldn't like that the fact of speaking English and not German could block me some opportunities (housing, meeting people, speaking with teachers...)   
I will probably have more doubts in the next months, but this is basically what worries me at the moment. Thank you!

			Yes, exactly I too agree with my friends its really tough for a simple person to arrange and give a perfect shape..if you really want to manage the shape without having and scratches on your stone you should have to consult with Goldsmiths who have a solid knowledge as well they will also suggest you to what would be beneficial for the stone your are worried about.  Otherwise, you may also contact with the store from where you bought that. Do, anything after knowing the true facts which doesn't harm your stone.   
Thanks & Regards,

			We are thinking about installing some sort of filter/device to deal with it. According to our neighbour our shared sewage pipes are about one third less in diameter than when installed due to kalk build up. We have also wondered what sort of build up is happening in the under-floor heating system. We already use a Britta filter & anti kalk tablets in the washing machine.    
Richard: do you have a link to the system you use so I can read more about it?

Is there any place we can take them?  We are in the Oberstrass neighborhood of Zurich.   
Any ideas of how best to dispose of the books?

			Ok, just an extra tip if I may - when you drill just make sure you have somebody to vacuum that stuff up as you drill.  The hard stuff is probably 
""backstein""  (baked stone) which is brown and it is very tough to get out of white walls and all those little crevices in the stucco.   
Think of those flowers that have the brown stuff that stains everything - even Swiss Windex called Potz etc. will be hard pressed to get that stuff out).   
yeah and re thumbtacks - forget it - I'm a brad and wire nail girl myself - I hate big holes in the walls - for anything heavy here you have got to drill.

			FYI the costume shop under the Red Cross Vet shop is an easy walk from Plan Palais.  I don't remember the street, (Rue de Carouge, maybe?) but its about 1/2 block from the round point, pretty much right across the street from an Easy Money pawn shop and Holy Cow hamburger restaurant.  I think that the #12 tram goes right past it, if I recall correctly.

			Hi Folks,   
We have just bought a lovely new house in Saland and are moving there in a couple of days.      
We are a small family (hubby, myself and our 4 year old daughter). We moved to Zürich from Sussex, UK three years ago and last year decided we love it here enough to put down roots!   
We are used to living in the countryside having lived in the sticks in England most of our lives, and this certainly influenced the choice of the location for our new home. However, my Swiss German is non-existent and my High German does not fare much better I am afraid - but while trying to improve my grasp of these languages, it would be great to meet fellow EFers who live around the Pfäffikon ZH, Wetzikon, Bauma, Uster area for a coffee and a banter.   
Please holler at me if you are a nachbarn..and even if you are not, a friendly hi is always welcome!!   
Laters

			A note back to the PILATUS link. There's a monthly magazine for walkers called SCHWEIZ (it's in German), the last issue was all about/based on Mnt. Pilatus. You should still be able to get a copy in a Kiosk.   
Enjoy your walk

			If you live in the area around Oftringen/Zofingen/Olten, there is an organisation which will happily take your old, unwanted stuff. 
They open for Swiss and foreign families who don't have much to live on   and also offer a place for them to have a coffee and a chat.   
The website is only in German, but I have a student who works there and she speaks fluent English.       
The name of the organisation means 'food and clothes', but they take in almost anything. Furniture can't be stored there, but if you have some to give away, you can take a photo and send it to them. When it is needed, they will let you know.   
They also collect Cumulus points if you decided to use one of their special cards as opposed to the normal Cumulus card.

			Hornbach has a line of drills (blue colour), can't remember the name that is great for price/quality. It is an English name. Have done a lot of drilling of large holes into reinforced concrete (including in the bomb shelter). Works like a charm.   
In any event, get a model that uses the drill bit style on the right of this photo (sorry, I don't know the proper name). It drops into the drill when you pull back the holder. It is designed for a serious drill.      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Nov 2012	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Buying Hammer Drill reccomendation.	TigerMeowMeow	Posts: 34

Used all the recommended gear and the ceiling is basically done. There are a few places where a secondary adhesive that was used is sticking and I have to deal with that. The sander has an adpater which connects to a shop vac to extract the dust....well some of it, but certainly not all.      Indeed it is. I used a scaffold in addition to a step ladder. I think my arms are longer.    
Now we have to decide how to paint it. The painter wants to spray the wood to get better coverage between the wood slats.

			Check your local grocery store. There is usually a bulletin board near the checkouts where people can post free classified ads. These tend to be cheaper than special bike markets, etc.   
For example, I checked yesterday and someone in my local Migros (I realize Glarus is probably too far for the OP to travel!) was advertising a woman's bike in ""like-new condition"" for CHF80.  I'd take the condition with a grain of salt, but still. Bargains exist.

			Hi everyone.   
The newly founded English Society at the University of St. Gallen (one of the best-regarded business universities worldwide) is looking for a partner from the business world to sponsor our (small) contribution to the students' welcome packages this September.   
Every incoming student (approx. 1500) receives a welcome package on arrival at the HSG - sponsoring one of the small gifts (e.g. fire lighter, ruler, pen etc) helps us raise awareness for the English Society and ensures a high level of visibility amongst HSG students for the sponsor in question.    
This is one of the most effective opportunities for SMEs who lack the financial clout of UBS, Syngenta, Credit Suisse etc to raise their profile at an elite university.    
The English Society is for students and alumni of the University of St. Gallen.   
Beginning in September, we hope to provide the following benefits to members:   
- A platform for native English speakers to connect, socialise and network   
- An opportunity for non-native English speakers to utilise and improve their language skills   
- British and North American themed events, social evenings and parties   
- English speaking alumni and guest-speaker events, Q&A sessions and networking apero sessions       
For more information about sponsoring, guest speaking, or the English Society in general, please don't hesitate to get in touch via PM.   
Many thanks,   
Louis

Just wanted to add to this point - do be sure that you discuss your experience level with the Tierhiem staff. This shouldn't be a problem, but knowing that you are new to dog walking the staff will likely then pair you up with an 'easy' dog to start.    
You might also ask if the Tierheim has a volunteer training or orientation program.     
Good luck!

			I arrived in Lausanne a week ago and I'm here for the summer doing an internship. One of things I'd really like to do while I'm here is to just get out and about, travel, meet new people, and especially improve my French! However, I must admit I am a bit intimidated and uninitiated. My French is so-so, certainly usable, but I don't have a lot of real world experience speaking it, so it's difficult for me to approach strangers without some shared context that'll aid my comprehension. I'm also living alone, and don't know anyone here, so there isn't a local whose social group I can latch onto. Finally, I am also not use to city life. I've lived most my life in a rural town where everyone knew everyone and the closest movie theater was a 30 minutes drive through winding country roads to the closest small city, so I'm not even sure I'd know what to do in an English speaking city to meet new people!   
I suppose my main question is: how have you expats in the past met new people and initiated yourself with the language and city? For example, I'd love to make some friends with students from UNIL or EPFL, but I don't know how to become introduced to those ""social-cliques"" (so to speak)!   
I'd appreciate anyone's help :-)   
Cheers!

			Is it really an either/or decision?   
It's just a short, cheap flight between CH and the UK.    
Why not try the job in Sheffield, see if it really is the right path for you, and visit each other on weekends?  At the end of a year (or two, or three), re-evaluate.   
Jobs in academia are difficult to find these days - step off the path and you might not be able to find a way to get back. If you are certain that academic research is the route you wish to go this is something you have to consider.   
Think of the Sheffield move as a temporary situation, a trial period. A little distance won't tank the relationship if she really is 'the one'.     
Based on my experience, the lingering 'what if' questions are far deadlier to a relationship than a little bit of distance.   
Wishing you all the best...

			Canvas obviously provides a superior surface for artwork but the same is also true of digital photography. Digital photos on canvas really can create a striking visual impact and not only that, a digital photo on canvas can be created from any of your own personal collection of digital photos which obviously adds to the sentimentality of the piece and makes it all the more personal to you. Digital photography has, of course, become much more accessible in recent years and this has made photos on canvas an extremely popular and stylish means by which to decorate your home. Canvas has the capacity to really bring the most out of digital photography and canvas prints can really be of anything which means that this form of decoration is very easy to dovetail around the existing design principles that run through your home.

I had the original receipt, the box was unopened, but when I went back to the store, I needed to explain the whole story (in broken German), and the cashier was only able to give me a cash card to be used in the store..   
It's quite different than in north america, where you just walk into the store, and tell them ""I want to return the item.. i don't like it anymore

He gave me very bad experience, didn't listen what I say, and kept talking bad things about my current driving school. Every time at class he spent around 30 mins telling me that I should quit the other school, and only learn with him, blah blah blah. I paid to learn driving, not for hearing all his unpleasant groans, which is really ridiculous in my opinion. The way he talked and behaved seems really crazy to me. He even kept saying 'I am not crazy' himself several times during his talking. I suppose he also think he was behaving over-reacted at that time? I listened calmly, only hoped it can stop, and move on to the actual driving part, but the groan just went on and on. Most of all, after I decide to finish with him, and told him I have unfinished hours he should answer to. He told me to go home to wait for his contacting, but he never contact me. I sent him SMS, he never answered. I waited for his answer for months, isn't it enough time? I went to confront him when I ran into him on street, he said he was in a rush, no time for me, and pretend he doesn't know what's going on. I sent him a registered mail, so far, didn't hear anything from him. Seriously, I try not to think of this whole unpleasant past as much as possible since recalling the whole story is like a nightmare to me. Anyway, this is life. whoever doesn't run into some garbage in one's life time once or twice? We need to be responsible to our own dignity. May I say, I hope he learned his lesson, and treat other people nicely in the future.

			Poorly written indeed. Batteries store energy using a reversible chemical reaction.   
Supercapacitors store energy directly as electrons which allows for faster charging of a battery built using such materials. ""super"" simply meaning can store more charge for same volume as compared to older capacitor technology.    
The supercapacitive material developed by the young lady can store 3 times the electrons per volume compared to previously known materials, and approaches the energy density of batteries used in cellphones, which makes this material a feasible replacement for the material currently used inside cellphone batteries, resulting in a battery that could be charged much faster.

			Hello everyone,   
I am originally from Malaysia, received my Bachelors in the US and now working in a health care consulting company (still in the US). I was wondering if there's any current ETHZ or D-MTEC students/alumni, or anyone informed with happenings, that could provide insights or feedback in the below program (MSc Management, Technology and Economics), which I am interested in applying this Autumn          
Some preliminary questions I would appreciate feedback (since I can't seem to find the info online from the school's website):   
1) How competitive is the program (i know it's highly competitive...)? But what i meant is eg. how big is the entering class size for MSc MTEC each year (how many applied, how many got accepted/rejected, how many enrolled etc)   
2) What's the profile of students being admitted? Eg. fresh out from Bachelors? with several years work experience etc? Also, what's the average age of students being admitted? (just curious, because i know some management programs prefer older students..)   
3) Is the internship placement (part of the program requirement) at a Swiss company almost guaranteed? Does ETH help the student in securing one? Or is it quite tough to secure one in view of the current economic climate, especially for a non-Swiss student?   
4) Any other positive/negative first-hand experience from current students or alumni or people with familiarity. If you do not feel comfortable discussing them here, please send me a PM and i would look forward to discussing offline!    
Thank you so much,  I hope to hear from anyone soon!

			Hello EFers,   
I recently fell for machine sewing and discovered quilting. I am a virgin when it comes to sewing terminology and techniques so excuse me. I'd like to know what's the german name for ""basting spray"" in Switzerland. I found an online shop in CH that sells Sprühfixierer. Is it the same? 
I ordered online some supplies from the UK but.. at both times I really had no clue what I needed exactly and if I needed it at all. This time I decided to follow instructions and would like to move on to this experiment as soon as possible. The tutorial calls for ""paper backed fusible web"" and a ""masking tape"". Could anyone help me with german equivalents?   
Thank you very much.

It doesn't really make all that much difference whether the distance is 25m between two buoys or 50m. It will give you practice at turning the head a bit further for breathing in, lifting the head slightly (Preferable without dropping the hips) to check direction towards the buoy -  which is exactly what'll you'll be needing to do swimming long-distance in free water. You'll get practice at breathing only on the lee side when it is windy and when a boat just has gone by; you'll get used to seeing webbed feet ahead; you might have to contend with breast-stroke swimmers with a screw-kick whom you'll need to give a wide berth. However if you go round the buoy and then straight back 'inside' the limits of the bathing area, you should avoid boats, ferries and yachts OK.

			Hello,    
Just seeing that now - not sure if you're still looking for help - but here's a handy set of training videos in english:    
I am a wordpress developer (i create wordpress sites for clients) and i usually guide them to these videos to learn how to take control of their website. Most of them have been pretty happy with the series, so i guess it may be useful to you too :-)   
Good luck and let me know if i can help you out with anything!

			Hello everyone!    
I might be relocating to Basel soon during this year. Just waiting for the offer from my company.    
I wonder if you have children, and I would appreciate to know more about the options who took: were to live? what school to choose for your children (bilingual, german speaking, public or private)? either to have a car or not? what costs should I consider when appreciating the offer from my company? do you travel often to Portugal to ""matar saudades""?   
I don't speak german at all (yet?), and I have a 2 year old daughter.   
Any thoughts from those beautiful portuguese minds?     
thanks!

			Hey Nanda,   
I've been to Globus for facials and I really do have to say I've always had a great experience. I think it is fully worth the price  and it's really not more expensive than other places. I actually went to labo spa - very pretty, but had a bad experience and found it very expensive. At Globus, they will tell you what kind of facial you need and what products they think best to use too. This girl Regula (don't know her last name) is really so good. Sweet and gentle.

			2 things not mentioned here:    and have no hook, you need to buy one from lumimart/Interio/co-op etc. Do NOT use this type of hook  it will pull down part of the ceiling if the light is too heavy.   
I can't find an image of the one you need and have only found them in Switzerland, if is basically a hook attached to a flat grip that expands when the hook is turned. You insert it into the hole in the ceiling (that the electrical wire comes out of), turn the screws and it expands to grip the plasterboard. This will hold a decent sized light.     You MUST use the correct raw plugs for the type of ceiling you have, do not screw direct into the ceiling or it, and the light, will come down. Find the correct raw plugs (Jumbo/Obi etc) they will have instructions on what screw and what drill bit to use on the back.

			Have you tried the local Lost and Found office? It's called 'Bureau des Objets Trouvés' in french, no idea what the german would be. 
Sometimes it takes a day or so for things to be sent on to the office from wherever they've been found originally.

			Heya    
being that we are moving at the start of august i thought to contact a friend of mine who works at quarantine and luckily enough in the imports department. Ha told me that every container coming in the has one importer ,as in its not a shared container, is being searched. Also according to him , if there is any sort of wood on the inventory the whole container will be treated. There are two methods , either fumigation  where the container is pumped full of some sort of gas ( i have forgotten which one ) or its treated with gamma irradiation.  
Gamma irradiation is limited in the size of things that can be processed ( i enquired with a company used by AQIS for my horse equiptment, Steritech  .com.au)    
We have a quote for our 20 ft container from Schneider Moving Excellence for CHF8,500 door to door meaning that they will pack and unpack for us. Insurance is an extra 2.2% of the value of the goods.    
Hope this helps a little

2523	14.04.2013, 01:01	Junior Member	Thanked 10 Times in 7 Posts	Location: Zurich	"     It's cheaper to ship from Germany to CH, then it is from the CH to Germany. In fact, in some cases, it is cheaper to ship from France to anywhere in the CH( on heavier items), then it is to do it internally.   
The reasons? Cheaper workforce, government subsidies, shipping by boat brings down the overall costs and increases profits to pay less for over the road transport, such extensive use of the rail network in those countries, and so on.   
45 CHF sounds about right. You should ask if they have a book rate. They do in the US, and it makes shipping books extremely cheap, as long as you are willing to wait forever to have them delivered. Or, wait until you are at the border yourself and can mail it from the EU.

			Fleurop is indeed one option. 
You can also try this site:  , this is a flowershop only selling roses with shops in Zürich, Luzern and some other cities. They have a webshop and compared to Fleurop, prices are very reasonable! 
Most flowershops have a delivery service for a small fee as long as the delivery address is within a certain distance but you need to check this with your local flower shop (if there is a website, this is mostly stated).

			Not really sure where to stick this as there is no Technology forum... my all-in-one Pixma MP610 printer is not printing colour photos correctly anymore. The colour is either too red and there are vertical lines or stripes. I have already taken out and cleaned the printer head with window cleaner and then rinsed with distilled water, put in new CLI-8 cartridges but still the same thing. Text documents printouts look fine.   
Can any techies advise whether the print head is well and truly gone? Judging the price for a replacement (90-100 CHF) I'd probably be better off buying a new printer. The only downside is, the cartridges probably won't fit the new Canon models.

			I used to be a teacher of salsa, merengue and danzon. I am originally from Mexico and have danced all my life. But now Im into finance and almost have no time to do it. 
However, as I used to do it in the states, I will go to your house and teach you and your friends. For 1,2 or 3 hours from basic to advanced. That way you dont have to feel ""embarased"". I will show you how to listen to the beat, listen to the melody (which is pretty easy) and then teach you to forget about COUNTING! and start having FUN with it! I believe that here in Zurich, people count too much and forget about what salsa is all about...having fun!!! Actually it is pretty easy.  
Let me know if you are interested. I can travel around Zurich area only. Due to work I am book almost all the time. But I have some time on wensdays. Obviously I can teach in english, french or spanish. 
A BAILAR!!!

I read in the Tagesanzeiger recently that A&F is about to open the first continental European store here in Zurich. If I am not too wrong, it'll be the location at Bahnhofstrasse betwen Manor and Globus where Benetton used to be.  
According to the newspaper the shop is about to open pretty soon (mid August?)

			Hey ya all...!    
I moved with my man to Schaffhausen a little more then a month ago... Before we lived in Luzern... We have to move probably in the future again but then again-maybe not because my man is a proffessional sportsman and work based on his contracts with the Swiss clubs... 
But I have no friends in here-in Schaffhausen...  Even ONE friend would be nice- A GIRL then (guys-don't get me wrong- but I DO look for a just a girl-friend to hung out with, so- you have no chance!  ) Just someone with who to meet up sometimes and go for a walks or coffee or just walk in the city... 
I am not into money (read: shopping and expencive stuff), parties and hunging out in the posh bars, shops or places... I am very nature and animals loving, hippie like minded and also love to go for a cycling or jogging/hiking... I am not looking to have some kind of party-babe friend but rather someone simple, honest and close to nature and a person with a good humour with who to make silly girls-jokes and hung out with... 
Please read ,,about me,, section too-as I am into making jewellery and arty stuff and I love more bohemian way of living and thinking (lets be honest-it's not for everyone ), so lots of people don't understand it... 
So if you are cool, genuine and funny girl-and also live currently in Schaffhausen-PM me and maybe we can be friends one day-if we are similar and we have something to talk about and feel the good vibe... 
I speak english and my german is s..t, to be honest  and I do not drive a car-so bikecycle is my best friend . 
Peace and Sunshine!!!

			In many cities there are also fixed collection points / ""Sammelstellen"" run by Texaid, like for glass and aluminium.   
If you missed a collection date, this might be a good solution. Just trot down and throw your bag in.

			There seems to be something about Basel that makes it better than some other cities.  I go to meetups here, hell I even arrange them, and they're not full of moaners.  Even newbies to Switzerland arrive full of optimism, talking about sitting by the river with a BBQ, going skiing, crossing borders etc.   
After I arrived, there was one moaner who moaned quite a lot for about 4 months or so, but luckily they eventually realised it was pretty good here and shut up with the moaning.  That was me.  Like Sbrinz I kept comparing Switzerland (well, Basel) unfavourably with Stuttgart.  The reality was just that I was missing my friends there and hadn't built up my social life here yet.   
I think Basel tends to have people who have chosen to come here rather than those working for big multinationals who got transferred kind of against their will (or who came without knowing a thing about the country and only travelled because of their expat package.  I'm looking at you, Zurich).   
I lived in Stuttgart for a year and it was very similar to Basel.  I arranged weekly dinners and often weekly weekend trips to nearby places.  Everyone was enthusiastic apart from one small group.  They were the moaning wives of expats sent here from the US.  One came to a dinner and moaned, then the following week another came.  They quickly found each other (as everyone else was ignoring or not agreeing with their moans).  The third week they brought some friends and just sat together and moaned.  In the end someone else in my group had had enough, laughed at them, and said they must be losers to all be here if they hated it so much.  Never saw them again.  Phew!

you might need your reading glasses.    
Printed on the ticket are numbers like 39 - 47 or 38 - 48, and you have guessed, the shoe is available in these sizes.    
You take the suitable boot or shoe to the counter and order a 47 and a 48 size. After about 10 days, the shop phones you and  
you go in, try them both on and buy the one that fits you best.    
Not many people know that!           (Though I have published this here twice before, and the prices are very attractive too!)

			The are whole lot of places to restring the rackets and some of them listed here e.g.:                       
In case of tennis, they usually charge between 30CHF without the string. For squash racket it should be similar or slightly cheaper as far as the sweet-spot size.   
If you are not a regular string breaker I would advice to use on of the above services. Otherwise, if you buy your own reel of string it comes much cheaper.   
Optionally as mentioned above, I would get a restringing machine depending how frequently you break the strings   "	earned some respect	Join Date: May 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Costs for repairing Squash racket string?	BenderRules	Posts: 237

The good thing about the one in the picture above is that is doesn't have arm rests which means it fits closer to it's neighbour than most designs.

			Depending on what kind of goods you want, you can buy some of them at American shops here in CH. You'll pay more, but it might be worth it compared to shipping costs.   
Alternatively, try to find products here that are reasonable substitutes for your American faves. It takes some trial-and-error but it does work. We also have found substitute products in Germany, France, and Italy and buy when we are visiting those countries.    
If you have specific products you're looking for, feel free to post and Forum members can probably give you tips on where to find them or what might work as an alternative.

			No, at least not that I know of/can see anywhere.   
There is an IKEA credit card. Credit card holders tend to get special deals (i.e. 20% of all kitchen installations or something like this).   
There are also ""Wacky Wednesdays"". On Wednesdays, each store offers a huge discount (like 50-70% off) one particular item. I've never seen an item I wanted or needed, sadly.    
And twice a year there is the rather confusingly-named ""IKEA Annual Sale"". It generally happens after Christmas, and then at some point in the summer.   
Despite all the products being identical at ikea.ca and ikea.ch, it seems as if the offers are quite different!    
I think all I wanted to really know was if the IKEA Family Card offers are worth waiting for (i.e. sleeping on a camping mat and waiting 3 weeks to buy a bed!).    
I don't suppose that info's readily available, but figured I'd chance it all the same!

			I agree with Lou.    Located walking distance from Kreutzplatz.   
This was the fourth place I tried in Zurich (one salon turned my hair orange!) and I was finally happy.  They are super nice there and it is the salon experience I was searching for.  It was the first salon in Zurich that I felt like I could get same quality services that I got in America for about the same price I would pay in America.    
I see Waleska and she does great cut and color.

			We have a Nexus 7 and an older Samsung 8.9. Both are recommended. The Google device tends to get software updates sooner but the Samsung is an older model.    
I would suggest first deciding which size would suit your needs best.    
If you use something like the free MyPhoneExplorer, you can browse and transfer files over Wifi, so USB connection becomes less important, although most still connect with USB if you want.

			Hey guys,    
My visa for Sept 2009 finally got processed, woohoo! It took only 6 weeks through the local consulate.    
I'm moving from Canada so hope I can meet everyone, too. My email address is (removed). Maybe we can set up a hello for all the newbies.    
I need to start looking for housing, and will start a post on it. Homegate.ch has very limited options, and the rest seem to be in Italian. Does anyone know whether you can sign a lease/arrange for housing without your residence permit yet?   
Regarding budget, hope you are aware that you can work up to 15 hours per week on your visa.

			I joined Ricardo, to dispose of interesting stuff in the barn.  It took me about a month to work my way thru the German registration, and open a seperate bank account to accumulate my cash hoard.......   
So, I sat an entire day, after deciphering all the German, and Google translating my blurbs ......uploading photos ..... working out the delivery prices.   
And today, suddenly I get an email that someone mailed me on the site making an offer - which I`m very happy to accept.   
BUT .... there seems no way possible to reply to them!  Just no way.  I tried everything.  Even getting someone to write in ""proper"" German to their help answer service .... and all I get back is, (in German) something along the lines of ""Hey Bro, you seem to have a problem, what exactly IS your problem?""   
Then I see that a photo is missing.  Try as I like, impossible to upload (download?) another photo!   
THEN I see that 3 of my items are ""expired"" even though there should be another 5 days till expiry date.   
Oh Jeez ..... it is AWFUL  to be such an ignoramus in this country!

			Hi and welcome to Switzerland.  First, it's La Tour de Peilz, like orange peels.  I have 3 kids in their 20's who come here to visit 3 or 4 times a year and they like to go down to Ouchy to the MGM bar down by the docks.   
They also go into the Flon later at night.  They have been to the clubs down there a few times, but it is really expensive so be forewarned.  They have had no trouble finding other english-speaking young people at the many, many bars in Lausanne and they often stumble home at 3 or 4 in the morning, so my advice is to try Lausanne.     
I'm sure some students will chime in here and you will be well taken care of.  Good luck!

			I understand from a British friend, a property owner in CH, who has done it (but is not yet dead!!) that you can write your will and require it be probated under UK law.  He recommends using a Notaire for this.  In this way you can choose to avoid the ""enforced heirship"" that Swiss law requires. 
However I am not sure what happens about estate/inheritance tax.  If you go by UK law do you then make your estate subject to UK tax?  Here in VS we have no estate tax so it is not something one wants to incur!!

			Being a trailing spouse has definitely threatened my relationship. There have been times where I feel like I need to choose between my marriage, and my mental health, and not wanting to lose either - it felt like a very desperate place. My husband is lovely and it's not that he has done anything wrong or badly, but our situations became so different it was hard to relate to one another, and I could feel resentment just waiting for a moment to creep in.   
For me the turning point was identifying more clearly what we each wanted, and assessing frankly whether Switzerland is the best place for that. Now we are looking at possible options that meet both our needs with minimal compromises on our priorities.

1. There is no formal interview. They might call you in and ask what do you want the weapons for, that's it. E.g. in my case it was just for shooting as a hobby. 
2. When I sorted out my permits, I didn't need to be part of a club upfront and I didn't need any confirmation from club presidents. However, being a foreigner you are required to attach a document from the police of your home country that they have no qualms about you owning firearms in Switzerland. Note, you don't need a permit in your home country at all.   
There was a chap here from the UK who got this sorted recently. All he needed was the above confirmation form the metropolitan police and he got his permit sorted in no time.

			Hello!   
My husband and I are planning a house-hunting trip in the next week or so prior to our final move to the area between Geneva and Lausanne in early April.  We'd really like to bring our two kids with, so that they can visit the school they'll be attending, etc.  But, the company will only cover the cost of one hotel room (2 people) for the trip; and as European hotel rooms (at least the ones I've been in) are generally very small with room for no more than 2 people, we'd have to rent a second room and split up the family which would be expensive and inconvenient.      
Does anyone know of any hotels in that area that have family-size accommodations?  (And, ideally, don't charge extra for each individual person staying in the room?)  Our kids are older (10 and 13) so splitting up the family wouldn't be the end of the world; just inconvenient.  The cost is the bigger issue.   
Any suggestions would be very much appreciated!

			The short version: You may only pull the trigger if 1) you are allowed to have a gun in the first place and 2) your life was in danger and shooting was the only way to save it.    
The long version is to be discussed in your local Schützenverein, but the concept of self defense is here so restricted that you probably would call it something else.

			If you are in the area check out El Classico on Bethovenstrasse (zh). It is right across from the Hyatt. They have a great selection of iron free shirts including olymp and strellson (i am also a big fan of olymp. they are truly wrinkle free.). They have really good and friendly service (english speaking too), and their prices are generally lower than the bigger department stores like jelmoli.

			Sorry, my own observations with this match that of others - professional photographer hired for a private sitting, often in a family setting.    
My in-laws have some really beautiful professional photos taken during afternoons out with their boys. On the one hand it is more expensive, on the other, they have a lot more character, as it is photos of the family playing together rather.

			I've had this happen with our dishwasher, but it's usually because i've forgotten to clean the filter (take it out and wash it off). Once it was because a piece of clear plastic found its way into the entrance of the drain pipe.   
But i usually take all the pieces apart that i can, wash the filters and run it again. And no, youdon't have to rinse dishes off - there's not much point in having a dishwasher. On the other hand, it is a good idea to clean off large pieces of stuff.

			I am a bassist for a duo in the US.  My twin brother and I, 60, play in quieter venues than we did when we were younger: restaurants, wine tastings, sipping socials, weddings, private parties, fraternal organizations (dislike the most), etc.     
And so, I'm wondering what the music business is like in Switzerland.      
Could two guys who play a load of variety instrumentals, and are able to sing as well, stay working there?    a sample of what we play in restaurants.  And    Our vocals aren't star quality, but we are able to perform and sing an entire 3-4 hour gig (prefer 3 hours) with plenty of music to spare.  What kind of wages are paid to bands, anyone know?   
The over fifty crowd likes us best for dancing, since we play their style of music that includes polkas, waltzes, line dancing, jitterbug and swing tunes.

			Dear expats,   
I am currently a graduate student enrolled in the International Management program at the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland in Basel. This semester I will be conducting practice oriented research project with a group of four students in preparation for our Master’s Thesis.    
The topic of our project is Global Mobilization with a focus on repatriation. We would like to explore the challenges expatriates face during the repatriation process and find potential solutions to improve the situation. In order to receive firsthand knowledge we would like to speak directly with expatriates and repatriates who can describe their experiences.   
As a result, we are looking to contact and interview expatriates who have been involved in an international assignment.We are kindly asking for your assistance! If you or someone you know would be willing to assist us in our research project, we would greatly appreciate it .   
We would like to focus primarily on repatriates who have returned to Switzerland within the last three years or expatriates who will be returning in the next six months to Switzerland.    
Please note that all information would remain anonymous and confidential. If this is something you are willing to assist us with please feel free to contact me via pm We would truly truly appreciate it.    
All the best!    
Gabrielle

I used these people for my UK tax returns when I lived there.   
The way I read the link I posted previously from Inland Revenue you will be a tax resident in the UK for pro rata for the time you were in the UK.   
I am making some assumptions there though. Did you have a job with a UK employer? Were you living in the UK? Were they deducting UK tax each month?   
Do you have to file a tax return or are you just choosing too?   
Anyway the guys above advertise a no return, no fee. You may want to look at how much they take. If you are expecting a big return for some reason you may want to find someone who charges a fixed fee.

(Bestellen - is ""to order"", so you need that one. Lieferaddresse and lieferdatum are delivery address and delivery date.    
Then section 4 says that they will choose the florist for you, I assume that's OK.   
Section 6 is the text you need to enter for the card.   
Section 7 is the other crap they try to sell you   
And then Weiter is ""next"")

Unless those are money are from coke/meth dealers, that's another story.

2702	05.02.2013, 22:54	Member	Thanked 68 Times in 41 Posts	Location: Chur	"    I guess it's because   
1) They don't understand the market has changed and more people do round trips and complicated itineraries these days. They still think the typical holidaymaker is going to Mallorca with buckets and spades and will return on the same connection 10 days later. Ideally they'd also like to sell you a hotel of their choice. Creative thinking and individuality on your part offends them. Essentially, many airlines are still firmly stuck in the 1990s.   
2) Competition. They are afraid that if one-way flights are easier to get you will book the return with a different airline, so they want to make that complicated for you. They don't understand that people flying out with another airline may smilarly return with them. It's cartell thinking. You end up flying at times that are less ideal because the rival airline with more ideally timed flights cannot be combined with theirs. It makes things easier for scheduling as they can sell you what they want rather than what you want.   
3) Failure to understand. The likes of Easyjet and Ryanair shook up the industry and ate into the bottom line of the dinosaur-cartell-carriers. But these failed to understand what the game really was and responded simply by lowering their prices. Only slowly is the flexibility also following suite. It's like the food and drinks. On a legacy carrier its all included, meaning it doesn't have to be good or competitive and nobody cares whether you take it or leave it. Easyjet has to price and market its food and beverages and every sale counts so they have to listen to customers more. The result is that you now eat and drink better stuff on Easyjet than on the legacy cariers. Think of it like capitalism versus socialsm.   
4) They still beleive the customer is the enemy. Hence stories about blacklisting customers etc.

From memory, the price increased 10 centimes at the beginning of 2012 (?) to CHF 1.90. My guess is the guy had a ""senior moment"" and sold you a CHF 1.80 rather than CHF 1.90

			Most sellers expect to receive the money first, before posting. Don't forget to check how much you need to cover the postage. Use an old box to reduce expenses. Add SFr 5,-- for parcel recorded delivery (With Signature).    
You can offer bank / post finance money transfer (Or cash when the item is collected).

			90,000chf here, will go further than 24,000 pounds in the UK. You will be able to afford an average one-bedroomed flat on that.  ( and average, is nice.)   
No you dont need to have a car here for getting to the ski fields. Instead, buy a halbtax public transport card. That will give you affordable train and postbus travel to the mountains and elsewhere itn Switzerland.     
You should still have money left over at the end of each month - unless it all goes on the pub....

			As for online shopping , you can select one-hour slots, also in the evening. Delivery charges vary according to total expenditure. With Coop the minimum you can get should be 7chf (if you have enough points from your fidelity card you can use them to pay those charges and get the delivery ""for free"").

			A trial lesson typically costs 200-300 CHF for 60 mins of flying. Look or ask for a 'Schnupperflug'. Here is a random selection of schools which offer trial flights (but there are loads more):           
The trial lesson can be a one off thing (gift) or you can consider it to be your first lesson towards a license. In any case, you will need to contact a school to book a trial flight, even if it is a one-off or gift.

			You don't pay VAT + custom fees on gifts under CHF 100.-- (value + shipping costs) per person.   
So when people ship gifts to you, ask them to mention 2 or 3 first names on the address as it's CHF 100.- / pers. That's how we do it to receive gifts over CHF 100.-- and not have to pay VAT.

No DHL is not based on volumetric weight, at least not for the service i'm seeking which is sending a parcel to the states. so as long as dimensions of the box fits within 120x60x60, i can fill it with from 20 kg up to 31.5 kg for the same price which i think its a pretty good deal.   
i think the one which is based on volumetric weight is Fedex.

I'll check the contract and let them know that I'll start a Betreibung unless they return my money.  
Does anyone have experience with the process? Looks like I just contact the local Betreibungsamt, they make sure my claim is just and handle everything else?

			Do you realise that bringing in stuff that was bought within 6 months before moving is illegal if declared as moving goods?   
Items bought new in the last 6 months before moving must be declared as regular imports on which you will have to pay tax and customs fees.   
The tax exemption for moving goods is only for household stuff that's at least 6 months old.

			Living in Geneva I see how the Swiss do not particularily liek the French but seem to tolerate them. However German friends tell me that the Swiss Germans treat them very badly whne they visit Switzerland. If this is true why is there a difference between Swiss Germand and Swiss French towards their neighbours ?

			From time to time posters ask about volunteering in Switzerland. In our home countries it's almost a given that there is need and helping hands are very welcome; it is sometimes a shock to find that in Switzerland barriers to even volunteer work exist - most notably lack of Swiss-German.    
However, according to Swissinfo, the Zürich Red Cross has started a program of volunteer work aimed at expats keen to give back to their host country:

			I want to share this recommendation with you to read an amazing book by a young and talented writer, who is currently living in Zurich.  The book is powerful, at times quite brutal, and beautifully written.   The story is about a young man, Whittington, living in Africa and his relationships and journey from boyhood to man when he moves to Johannesburg for work.     
Entwined in the story are some beautiful insights into the myths and traditions of this dark continent, and at one point the story subtly touches on a ""taboo"" subject which should make us all sit up and take notice, and hopefully action.   
The book is available from Amazon, both for Kindle and Paperback -

			Hi Leonidas05, 
I definitely agree that you need a good, supportive boss and good colleagues to have a decent phd time.  I started a Chemistry PhD in UK but left after 8 months, not just because I realised it wasn't for me (later did a Pharmacology Masters and now working in Biology research in Pharma), but also the supervisor was not great, people were generally very nice though. I also realised the project was not that great either. I was a bit too young and inexperienced really, I would definitely go about things in a much different way now with the experience I have got through having some actual working experience! 
I know someone who just finished her Biomedical Sciences PhD in a lab in the Unispital. PM me and maybe I can get you in touch with her to get her opinion on unibas/labs/how things work/etc.

			Thanks for the link to the other thread.      Yes thats true, however I dont think people actually develop on the RP unless they want to check stuff which is not working on that specific platform. For example if you were developing an coupon  application for running in shopping malls, you may develop the main app on a PC and then transfer it to the RP for final testing of touch screen selections or printing issues.   
Whereas the PIC chips were good, they needed people to get right down to code in C or assembler. The RP can run linux and whatever can be cross-compiled on a PC to run on it can be developed on a PC before being moved across. PIC chips required more of a knowledge of electronics and components and PCB design whereas the RP is able to use already developed  arduino boards I think.

			I'd recommend actually asking someone from ETH, as the previous poster suggested.  When you list your GPA, it's almost completely meaningless as different countries use different measures of GPA.  What will be far more relevant is the institution(s) you received your GPA from, and the quality of the coursework as determined by whoever looks over your admission application at the ETH.   
I have no idea for Master's students, but in my experience, applications for Italian PhD students have been highly dependent on the above listed factors.  Often, they are required to take one or more courses or qualifying exams.   
If you are required to take extra courses - be aware, it's possible that they may only be taught in German.   
So, as stated previous, I'd recommend contacting someone in the department (such as whoever directs Masters studies) and asking the questions directly.   
Best of luck in your application!

			Hello, I am currently studying Bachelor in Information Technology with the GPA of 6.67/7.0. My university is on top 100 in Engineering & IT and top 250 in general. At the moment I am on my second year and currently persuading a vacation research. I will be graduating on July, 2014. Now I would like to get into Masters in Computer Science at ETH Zurich, but they actually want secondary school grades. I have studied my high school in Turkey, and I have done both national and GCE A Level qualifications. However, my results were horrible, from national I've got 2.5/5.0, from GCE A Level I've got DDE(so it's like 5/15). Furthermore, my current degree does offer computer science subjects, however no pure mathematics subjects. How likely would I be able to get accepted for Masters degree at ETH Zurich?

			I bought a wedding dress in Canada and I didn't have enough time to get this done there before moving to Lausanne ; but I dont like the original sash on my wedding dress. 
Does anyone know of a shop in Lausanne that will take it off for me and put on another one (that I have bought)   
Thanks so much!

			I don't want to lose sight of     needs.   
Here is a condensed version of Reks's description, sweet eh?   
""Reks is a very loyal companion, he loves to cuddle hours and with his soft plush fur, he is a like a cuddly Teddy Bear."" 
He loves to play football, (he is a guy after all). 
Hes not a ladies man.... what a gentleman 
""Where can this sweet gentle love treasure find, with his heart of pure gold, a place  and enjoy wonderful years and bestow his people with his love."" 
And too boot he looks like he could scare a burglar or predator off!   
Unfortunately people will overlook him for the following reasons.      He is Black:   For some reason black dogs are less popular.     He is Foreign so he must be different from other dogs:   I have two Bahamian street dogs and on our walks we have met Swiss owners with foreign dogs from Spain, Italy, Romania and Greece. I still find it amazing how similar dogs are around the world and how they all play the same with each other.     There must be something wrong with a dog if it is In a shelter:   This is very often not the case, often owners are not able due to finances, divorce (this is how I got my two, my brother got divorced and I got the dogs) to keep the dogs and are devastated to give up a faithful family pet.     He is not a puppy and who knows what his temperament is:   Nowadays the shelters do many tests to check temperament,  with other dogs, men women, children and let you know the results in the dogs description.  They dont want a dog returned so they are honest in their description.     He has breed specific medical issues:  His suffers from the problems of shite breeding (hip problems) Hes still plays football though.    
The shelters work very hard to overcome what are mostly psychological hurdles of potential adopters.

			That's a very nice idea. I'm sure it will be appreciated later.   
Like the others, I suggest a paper book diary.    
I have the one my grandmother wrote (wasn't a diary but stuff about healing as she was a healer). It's probably 50 years old by now and I'm glad to have it.

			Thanks! I can handle written German so that site is no problem. And i really like how they can engrave blades. The ones I had done are basically inked onto the handles and I am suspicious about whether it will last very long.    
I'm leaving for the US Jan 2nd, but I go again later this spring.  If I don't find a local option in the next couple days I can just tell people their Christmas gift is currently in the hands of very precise Swiss engineers and will be ready on my next visit!

			Here is my response to the insults mentioned above.   
The question of electrical wiring arises time and time again. Don't any of you search the Forum, or Google before you post? If you did I would not have to write the same drivel everytime would I?   
Are my postings correct? YES. Do my posts hurt some people? YES. What am I going to do about it? Well should I keep quiet and let people electrocute themselves, or should I point out their failures? Think about  Mr wise guys! I should have groaned you, but I reserve that for really bad situations.    
I have been repairing electrical equipment with voltages up to 32'000 volts, I am qualified to work by myself, since 1963. I am still here, so I must be doing something right!    
My son is a qualified Swiss electrician working in Bern. He told me not to trust the electricians' neon screwdrivers, and I pass this tip on to you free of charge. Don't ask him to come round and fix your lights, his working contract specifically forbids working for other people.    
Maybe some of you are students, then you have landlords or you are in a WG, who would be fitting the lamps for you. And don't talk to me about low wages, I draw social security, so I earn less than nearly everyone here.

			I got my refund rather quickly. I sent them a message   explaining that I would like a refund considering the substantial delays ( clearly proving the fault lies   ) despite claiming the items were in stock, then emailed them a screenshot of the transaction from my PF account, and they responded acknowledging the request and got it within a week.

There is also section in Balmeregghorn on top. I would recommend it more for skiing/snowboarding and free-ride from Bonnistock, which is my all time favorite. On Wednesday there were only few people and fantastic weather. There was avelanche coming down at 12h00 on cliff side which you could photograph from parking lot. I was a bit too late with my camera but imagine all the dust in the middle was aftermath. Overall, it's a great resort.

			Hey guys, 
First time posting in these forums, I wanted to get some advice/opinions on possible move from the US (Florida) to Switzerland. 
First  off a bit of background, me and my fiancee are both originally from  Europe (I am Swiss and she is German) but have been living in the US for  most of our life. We both go back to Switzerland/Germany every year to  visit family but I know that does not compare to actually living there  and working there. 
Recently we have been considering going back to  Europe as we feel the need for a change from Florida. I personally would  not mind a different state in the US, she is leaning more towards  Europe (most likely Switzerland). 
The reason I am leaning more  towards staying in the US is that it would be a change but not a drastic  change, we could get a change in weather to get out of the year-round  heat, but still enjoy most of everything we are accustomed to here in  the US. She leans more towards Switzerland to be closer to family  although there would be some more drastic adjustment we'd have to get  used to. 
I currently have a job where I have been working for 10  years and doubt Id be able to transfer to Switzerland if I ask, but  there is a slight chance they could agree. Most likely i would have to  get a new job there. My fiancee just finished her doctorate so is in the  process of applying for jobs both out of state and in  Switzerland/Germany. The Switzerland plan would be  if she gets a well  paying job in Switzerland, we'd move, and if i cannot transfer id look  for a job once there... 
I have come up with a few items to try and  make a more informed decision. Granted this is a bit biased since I am  personally leaning towards staying but wanted to get your opinions in  case you have been in the same place as me...anything you want to add or  ask please do..   
Pro's of staying in US (move to different state): 
- Not a drastic change 
- We can still enjoy all the things we are used to, just in a different setting 
- Conveniences we are used to such as everything being open late and weekends 
-   Cost of living here is cheaper (food, clothes, gas, just about  everything I can think of is cheaper here than in Switzerland) so we can  do with a lower salary. 
- All my retirement savings are here I wouldn't have to do anything or change anything, I have nothing in Switzerland 
- We both have US Greencards so no need to change anything there or fear of losing it    
Cons of staying in the US 
- Farther from family 
-  Less vacation time (I currently have 4 weeks after being 10 yrs at my  job but my fiancee would most likely start up with the usual 2 or 3  tops)     
Pro's of going to Switzerland 
-  Of course Switzerland is beautiful 
-  Better life-work balance (more paid vacations than in US, better maternity leave,  benefits, etc..) 
- Close proximity to Family as well as other European countries for vacation      
Cons of going to Switzerland 
-  What do with Greencard, keep it but we have to deal with double  taxation, give it up but then we'd be unable to come back to live here  if we decide to 
- Everything is more expensive, so we'd have to make a  lot more to keep the same style of living than we have here in S.  Florida. 
- We'd probably have to do with no car since I hear it is  crazy expensive to maintain one (gas, fees, etc..), I guess we are  spoiled in the sense of having a car here and being able to go wherever  whenever we want without having to wait for public transportation. 
-  Uncertainties: What happens to my 401k, can i leave it in the states and  withdraw at retirement? do i need to move it to Switz? Social security,  since I have contributed to it for most of my life, if I decide to move  and eventually decide to give up my green card (or its taken away for  not retuning often etc..) do i lose that benefit?   
This is just things at the top of my head...anything you can think of that we are missing or not thinking about feel free to comment/advise. 
Thanks!!

			Sorry I forgot to finish my last message..   
I know some French and I'm moving to Germany next year.. so hopefully I can learn it in a couple years.    
According to..Section 349 of the INA [8 USC § 1481] You can risk loss of American Citizenship if you are ""serving as an officer in a foreign country's military service, or serving in the armed forces of a country which is engaged in hostilities against the US;"" -I don't think America and Switzerland are going to go to war anytime soon.    
and according to the US Department of State website, if it's required I wouldn't lose citizenship..   
But I will contact the Swiss, American and Canadian authorities before I decide to do anything.

			Hi everyone   
I just wanted to let all the parents know that there is a free kids circus on every day at 2pm and 4pm at Markthalle.  The show runs for about 30 minutes and at the end of the show, the performers come out with props and play with the kids for an additional half an hour.   
It's quite good and even entertaining for the parents, and both times I've been, there have only been about 15 other children.   
It's still running every day, except Sundays, up until the end of December.

			Every resident of Zurich receives a trash recycling & disposal handbook (Entsorgungs-Kalendar in German) in their Postbox annually. I just received the 2013 edition last week.    
Among other useful information this includes 4 coupons, each of which allows you to dispose of up to 100 kg of waste (the types of waste accepted are also defined) FOR FREE in either of the recycling centers Hagenholz or Werdhoelzli.   
I have used this service myself a couple of times, loading up my car with misc bulky items that were too large/heavy to go in the regular trash bags and taking them to the Werdhoelzli center. The process is very easy and they didn't even bother to weigh my car or the stuff to be disposed. Just hand over one of those coupons and they are happy!

			It depends what your previous experience is. If you have already done some university cources you can ask them wether the will count them towards your bachelor's degree. Howeve as the study plan of the Federal Institutes of Technology (ETH/EPF Zürich and Lausanne) is quite strict and is designed as a three year course it is not certain wether this would actually shorten the time needed to finish your degree.   
If by experience you mean work experience then I'm afraid, it does not shorten the time you need to get a bachelor's degree.

			A home circuit is 10A, regardless of the number of outlets and rooms it supplies (sometimes 16A, but then you will have special sockets).   
You typically have three such circuits in your apartment, though there may be more (always multiples of three).   
You need to know which other rooms/outlets are on the same circuit, and not exceed 10A total for any given circuit.

I need to get two pearl necklaces restrung.  Having searched the forum (and only seen one unanswered post in the past), it seems that there is a market gap in terms of this question: where can you get jewelry repaired in Zurich and how much does it cost?   
Or, does anyone have any suggestion for some high quality and reasonably priced (at least by Swiss standards) jewelry repair locations?

I'll also point out that Jelmoli, while it does have a selection of 'gourmet' foods, it's a far cry from Whole Foods - Don't get your hopes up.

75,000 parcels were collected during the 15th 2 x Christmas campaign. The goods donated are distributed to needy people in Switzerland via the cantonal associations of the Swiss Red Cross. In collaboration with the national Red Cross associations, some are also distributed to families and social institutions in Moldavia, Romania, Belarus and Bosnia-Herzegovina.   
2 x Christmas is a charitable campaign supported jointly by the Swiss Red Cross (SRC), SRG SSR and Swiss Post. Over the Christmas period, people donate food and day-to-day necessities.

			i have 3 or 4 gps units but all depends what your intended use is...   
i have a garmin montana  for off road stuff and also for normal road work as it can take 10,000 waypoints   
a zumo 550 and 660 screen is bigger on the 660, both work the same but waypoints are limited - ok if you want to go a>b and other basic routings.   
and i have a tomtom that i use in the car (550 used in car a lot also)  tomtom interface is more intuative.   
 A friend uses his car tomtom on the bike all the time for basic road work in a waterproof case and a voltage adaptor - works fine.   
another thing to remember is if you dont want to pay for future map updates  the garmin is the easiest to use with downloaded maps - its a single file.   
OH - garmins use basecamp or mapsource so you can pre plan a route on your computer and then send it to the unit..   
tomtom doesnt have this facility but there is an aftermarket application called tyre, tries to do the same thing but its crap.       
my vote:   buy a second hand or refurbished 550, dont worry about the year of the maps installed either.

			You don't need a course to do them! Unless you really want to... 
They are easy to make. If you are lucky you can make them perfect from the first time. I used to do this a lot when I was 10 yrs old and I discovered that I like baking and playing with dough     .  
Don't despair if they are not right from the first time   but you don't need a course.

			Nice to hear that the choir I used to sing with hs such a good rep.  I joined the Swiss Gospel Choir (even though I'm not even Christian) because they are HOT!  We just got back from singing in Stockholm with 1500 other singers at a gospel festival.  Unfortunately only rehearse a few weekends a year and not in Basel at all.  However, they will be giving a concert at the Paulus Church in Basel in November.  Weekend of 8-9.  Don't miss it!     
Not sure how folks are attaching YouTubes but I'll try.  Sorry this is the only one up so far.  Disregard the last 2/3s.  Not relevant.  In case this doesn't work, go to:

Owning a business is also not a matter of being cheesy with everybody either.  Somehow the bills have to be paid.     
I understand both sides here.  With the current knowledge (little at best), I side with the shop owner, especially if 50% means CHF 49.- or less.

This question is more for the ladies.   
I am getting married in Lausanne this Summer and am searching for a make up artist for myself and my bridesmaids.   
I have checked the web, and phone book, but I am really looking to work with someone who has been recommended.   
Also, if you know a good hairdresser for up-styles, let me know!   
I understand French, so it doesn't have to be an english speaker.   
Thank you!

			He replaced leather soles on a pair of my husbands shoes, as well as replacing the heel part. He also put a thin layer of cork under the sole for extra comfort/padding/buoyancy? In addition he put a 2mm piece of leather round the base of the shoe/new sole so it looks like one piece of leather sole not 2 parts glued together (hope that makes some kind of sense the way I have described it...)   
Total cost was 135 chf.

			Hello to everybody   
I live in Portugal and I intend to move to Switzerland. I've finished my high school studies recently (about two years ago) and instead of going to university I've decided to take a sabbatical.   
Since I've family living there, I won't have problems in finding a job and such. But my biggest concern is that I want to continue my studies in Switzerland. I've already done some research about Swiss education system, but I saw that Portuguese nationals are required to have already a bachelor's degree if they want to study in a local university (that's what I was able to understand). Can I surpass this situation somehow?   
For example, it's possible for an adult foreigner to study in a local school, taking a night course and preparing for the federal examination ?  I've taken some french courses back here, so at least that won't be a serious problem...   
Thank you for your help and forgive my English writing.  Since this forum seems to be very informative about Swiss affairs, I've decided to come here expose my doubts   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Nov 2012	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Study in Switzerland	Lucius7	Posts: 1

			Hmm,  Maybe something is was lost in translation.  The 2 routes to take are as follows...   
You can use the 110V power brick (and US Cord to brick) ONLY IF you purchase a 220V to 110V down converter.  Get a Higher than 300 Watt version.  The 220V European to 110V US will have a standard US plug on the front.   
Friendly reminder: Some brands of 220 to 110 converters also have a 220V output PASS-THROUGH on the front or wherever.  DO NOT PLUG YOUR 110V BRICK INTO THAT ONE!  Not to confuse anyone but don't worry about the 50/60 Hz thing too much.   
Below is an illustration of sort.   
[220V WALL POWER]---[220V to 110 POWER CONVERTER @ 300W MIN]---[110V US XBOX POWER BRICK]---[XBOX 360]   
OR   
Buy an Xbox 220V Power Brick.  You can use a Swiss plug from the wall to the brick.  I bought my power brick out of Germany so I discarded the cord with their round face plug and used a Swiss desktop computer cord in its place. (a DE to CH adapter would have worked just as well).   
Another illustration. =)   
[220V WALL POWER]---[220V EU XBOX POWER BRICK]---[XBOX 360]

			Hi All   
I want to give an update on my situation as it could also happen to someone else. We finally spoke with the CEO of the company. And he turned out to be a true gentleman. He said it is not their policy to refund but the mistake was theirss at the first place as they promised to refund. Therefore they will transfer the money to our account. Cross fingers.   
Store manager was really new and he did not know. So, we will wait for the transfer but overall I am happy to hear that the ""word or mouth honesty"" exists in CH.   
Thanks again for all comments. Appreciate ef.ch a lot.

			The exact rule is that VAT of less than CHF 5 is not charged.    
As the current tax rate for most goods is 8% this translates into a value of CHF 62.50. For books the tax rate is 2.5% which equals a value of CHF 200.   
I always try to stay well below those limits as you never know which exact exchange rate the customs office will be using. And don't forget that shipping costs are considered part of the value!

Life as an expat is invariably a lot more expensive than for the locals even if you dont insist on living of baked beans at 4chfs a tin. You dont have the network of friends who are tradesmen, have relatives with place in the mountains; there's a lot of big ticket items locals spread over a few years carm ski kit, or whatever; plus deposit for a flat you have to pay ""expat"" rental rates because you are paying current market rates, not those of 10years ago etc etc.

			Interesting. Never heard of it before. But as I love anything crafty and home made. So I had to google around for it.    
For anything hand made or supplies, you can usually find them on Etsy.com. There is a seller called Bessie May from the UK.           
It looks quite expensive for someone not in the know. She writes that her nettle wool is made in Italy. So perhaps search in Italian? filato di ortica.

			Let's say that Graubünden is one of Switzerland's last areas where German/Swiss German invaded old Romansh language culture (up from the Walser migration and the Protestant Reformation, with a remarkable upgrade in the mid 20th century) without quite all traces being erased. Of course also places like Zürich, Winterthur and e.g. Gurtnellen are of Roman origin (Turicum, Vitudurum, Curtinella), but in Graubünden/Liechtenstein/southeast St. Gallen/southern Vorarlberg you have them at least partially in their unchanged original denomination (and not only in geographic names), not considering for a moment the (few) still existing Romansh and Italian regions. So there might be a higher degree of understanding in cultural interdependence, not only in the ""cities"", but also in the countryside, the local German speaking part of the population appreciating their Roman inheritence.   
Very different from the rest of Switzerland also the historical constitution of the 3 Leagues and its role in CH as an ally until 1803, its religious and geostrategical conflicts in the 17th century and other (the actual flag e.g. is afaik from the 1920ies, the old one in the Bundeshauskuppel is still the fusional patchwork of the 3 Leagues).

			There are almost no positions in CH medical schools for foreigners (unless you happen to be married to a Swiss national, and an outstanding student), but that is certainly not the case everywhere in Europe.  You might have better luck applying to medical schools in Germany or Ireland, although the latter is quite expensive.     
If you are willing to consider E-EU, there are English-language training programs at several medical schools there, as well, but the quality of training on that half of the continent varies from quite good (Jagiellonian in Krakow, for example) to rather poor.     
Note that Canada does not have a national acceptance criteria for foreign medical training.  Rather, those licensing decisions are made at the provincial level.  Indeed, some Canadian provinces are quite willing to accept Swiss residency training, which is generally well-respected internationally.   
You might check with   as a resource for learning what international medical residencies are accepted in Canada, and what are not.     
I hope that helps a bit... good luck to you.

I will be making my first ever trip to Basel the last week of November, and will be there for 2 weeks for work. I am wondering what all is the best attractions and what to do? I was debating going to Munich, but now thinking I want to stay and explore. Are there decent type of places to go to mingle?   
What about snowboarding? I was looking into the meetings and seeing about potentially going to some of those, but not sure if I wanted to just show up...

I took my class sledging up there. We had three winters where there were free iceskates available in the tep rink of the Kuntz museum - not last year though.    
I have not known school to close due to snow - not even the year of the ""Big Snow""  about 7 years ago. The infrastructure for keeping roads and paths open, is very impressive.

			I just bought a second, larger (4.3m) second-hand one for my children, from Ricardo for CHF 1 .   
(my 13yr. old needs to practice forward and backward somersaults, for springboard diving).       
worth a look, but you need to set up an a/c, which requires a couple of days IIRC.   
You have to sift through a lot of dealer ads., though.      also has them - where we bought our 3.0m one.     , also.   
The usual CH retail outlets probably wont have any till spring, now.

			It's hard to find reasonably priced anything in Switzerland ( ), but there is a baby store by the name of BabyHaus Wehrli close to you in Dietlikon:       
They have a pretty good selection. We bought most of our baby items in Germany, though (for much cheaper).

			Just wanted to let people know that if anyone is interested in this product, if you are in Zurich or near by, I could stop by at your place for a quick demo in person. To be a chef on qisine really doesn't require a culinary degree. What's most important is that you can make good food and you would like an opportunity to earn some extra money by taking advantage of your culinary skills.

			Just a side note on Ikea furniture guarantees, we have an Ikea Sturefors bed base which has a broken wooden rail and a 25 year guarantee. It is about 5 years old and they no longer make it. So off to Ikea we go, without the receipt (which we can not find) after much discussion, they ""may"" accept a claim, clearly it is less than 25 years old (production started in 2003) but they need to know the exact date of purchase to make our claim. I think it will be ok but the moral of the story is to keep your all receipts.

			Like... if you've been having problems with Hairy Crabgras (Digitaria sanquinalis), Smooth Crabgrass (Digitaria ischaeum), it is recomended that you water your lawn at this time of the Year.   
Watering helps give you the placebo effect, that your actually doing something against the problem. In fact the weeds will die soon anyway.    
Next year at the earlist point possible March/April (Depending on the Ground Tempratures) Fertilize, Resow and a LIGHT dethatching of the Lawn. Grabgrass and Millets need warmer tempretures to sprout. Dethatching or Lawn reonvations should be done in autum then there shouldn't be to many Problems          "	earned some respect	Join Date: Aug 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Gardening in Switzerland...

			You can still get boxsrpings but they are no where near as good as the other quality. I recomend a Laying. there are bed centres evrywhere in switzerland. You should never forget that most people spend at least 8 hours a day in bed. so the mattress is the last place that I'd save money on. We bought new ones last year, cost a shit load, but we sleep better and my wifes back is grateful for the change. she doesn't get migranes anymore! Like this place   plan the WHOLE DAY.

			I was at Coop this morning when an Italian bloke was paying for his goods at the till in front of me. I noticed he separated his items into 2 bags.   
As I walked out of Coop, this Italian bloke was heard in Italian and Swiss German giving a bagful of sandwiches and biscuits to a well known Somalian asylum seeker who was doing his job of working for a magazine for daily flyer distribution to patrons.   
The beneficiary of that kind deed thanked him profusely and I know it certainly made his day ( and probably mine as well ).

Our music style is varied and ranges from Rock to Blues to Soul and some more contemporary stuff as well, playing covers from The Who, Pretenders, Guns N Roses, Blondie, No Doubt, Kings or Leon, Toto, Pink etc etc... We've all played for a while, but enthusiasm and fit with the band are the key factors... We're all professionals (in our work - not as musicians) so we have a format where we learn new songs as individuals, then bring the pieces together at rehearsals for ""polishing"". This is the most efficient way for us all not to waste time... 
The band is a lotta fun and we plan to gig min once per month, more if time permits. If you're interested, drop me a line or leave a message here, and we'll arrange to meet at our rehearsal room for a jam.

There are some links you can click on to the right of the page, maybe one of those is the tune?

			Does any one have any experinve with Agence Fret Cargo? I used the   company to ship a 12kg package to US. Some  Edourd Senger...assured me that they will ship to US in 2 days, will take care of the clearing and customs fees and will deliver the package to my daughter  and for that i paid 500usd. I knew it was expensive but i wanted to have the shipment there asap since my daghter didn't have her winter clouths. 
My package arrived 3 weeks later and my daghter (student no car no money) had to go to airport to deal with customs, where we had to pay so many fines and fees!!! take a cab and take the package home.. 
I tried to call Fret Cargo but their phones are disconnected. 
Be really careful, with them!

			If you don't know what it is, you likely don't have it :)   
I am in a process of resetting BIOS password on my ThinkPad and that involves making an EEPROM dump from another machine using a serial interface... which happens to be another laptop. I have a USB-to-Serial adapter, but it doesn't do proper signaling emulation, so it doesn't work for the purpose.    
If anyone has an ExpressCard/Serial card and could land it for few hours, I'd be hugely appreciative. I'm also trying to buy one, but no local shops have it in stock and the matter is somewhat urgent.   
Thanks in advance. Don't forget your passwords and/or stay away from newer ThinkPads.

			I've logged onto the English Forum this morning and somehow found myself stuck in 1994.    
Tape to CD?  That's like copying something from stone tablets to parchment paper.   
If it's anything commercially available, it's probably cheaper to buy a new copy than to transfer it.  If it's something personal / irreplaceable, the easiest solution would be to find someone who still has a cassette deck on their home stereo.  Use the line-out to connect it to a laptop and rip it as an MP3.

It was one of the thermostats around the back which was faulty, causing hidden air-vent panel to ice up thus restricting cold air-flow to parts of the fridge.   
As the fridge was only two months out of warranty, he only charged us for the dismantling, cleaning round the back (it was built-in) and his travel time.   
He didn't charge us for the spare parts or the time taken to make the repair so we only need to pay half what we could have had to pay if they had wanted.

You pay 46 - 50% of the value for a LeShop voucher of either 50, 100, or 150 CHF. You have until Nov. 11th to use it on-line.    
Reading the find print this is limited to ""one per customer per order"". I read this to mean if I tried to buy another and use it for the same household (e.g., buy a ""gift"" voucher for my husband) they might turn it down. So, I only bought one.

			Hi All   
I'm wondering if anyone could suggest where I might find a (free) study room in the vicinity of Zurich main station or Zurich Stadelhofen where I could do my language studies with my tutor between 8 and 9pm. She is a great tutor, but lives over an hour away from me on public transport, but only 15 minutes away from the Zurich HB.  
Do the local libraries / museums offer such things? Are they open that late? I am not a student or I would try one of the universities, or is there a venue at the universities available to outsiders?   
All advice greatly appreciated,   
Jim

			Is there even any evidence for this (such as bank statements, receipts etc) or is it all based on what somebody thinks they can remember?    
Furthermore, things like shoes, clothes etc clearly depreciate over time so you cannot reclaim them. If money was lent and there was a clear agreement that it was a loan, then there are chances (part of) that money could be recovered. But as it all appears to be based on hearsay and unclear agreements, the judge could easily decide either way, or propose a compromise with both parties meeting halfway.

There was quite a crowd gathered to watch the whole place come tumbling down when I was in town last week.

			I had my hair and make-up done by Caroline Rohwer for my wedding. She was fantastic! I felt like a princess. She also did all my bridesmaids and my little 8yr old sister. Everyone looked sensational. Her website is:   - she offers really great packages. (It's a nice gift to treat your bridesmaids to hair n make-up on the wedding day, it calms them down a bit, as they are usually as excited/nervous as the bride!)

			Most legal matters are decided by expressing exact details in a common language. I do not think your A level French would be good enough for studying a law degree.    
I would recommend working in Geneva for a year or two, and then doing a course in law. This would also stand you in good stead for future employment: as you also need to get experience of real life.

			first of all, WELCOME TO FRANCE!! 
So, you are probably working in Switzerland, but living in France. 
And you feel lost in all the papers and processes 
you have to go through to settle here. 
Well, part of my job is to help you with all this complicated French 
paperwork until you feel more comfortable with the 
famous French ""bureaucratie"" 
Obtaining paper work in France can be complicated 
and frustrating. You need patience, time and 
organisation to get through the various lengthy 
procedures. 
Contact me and I'll be glad to give you a helping 
hand.

			Hi ""sflorida_sweetie2"".If you can find an appropriate afghan/ throw/blanket, I can embroider a motif as in the picture on the link you posted, on it .Or we can customize according to your wishes. That's one of the things I do with my little home based machine embroidery business. PM me if you would like that. I hope this helps

I just noticed you are in Basel. If you still can;t find the complete item , try what I suggested and look for a ""Stickerei"" shop in your area. They might be able to decorate your item locally.

			The US grill won't work with the bottles you get here in CH.  The regulator and fittings are different.  However, if you already have your American style grill here, you can get an adapter/new regulator to convert it over a lot cheaper than buying a new grill.

			I too would suggest leaving your furniture in the UK, or sell it and use the cash towards buying stuff here. We have stored ours in a family members spare room, if you only have a one bed flat, you won't need much space. Just bring anything you would really miss, your clothes, etc.  
When I moved here to be with my husband, we travelled by train from Manchester to London, Eurostar to Paris, Paris to Basel, then on to Zurich and finally Baden with eight bags between us, a bit of a struggle but also quite an adventure!

Both are small shows, Interlaken is no longer an active fixed wing airplane airfield, but the Patrouille Suisse will display in the afternoon.

3135	29.08.2012, 02:41	Junior Member	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	Location: Schaffhausen	"    I fully agree to half the arguments. No MBA of this world will turn you into an entrepreneur... but the other half is extremely US centric, only valid for top tier schools and overall frankly fairly opinionated.   
I have no problem to admit that I am not an entrepreneur and this is unlikely going to change. I am looking for jobs and indeed did change my job some eight months ago. So I looked through a lot of job ads and pretty much all of the ones I was interested said something like ""minimum technical degree; additional MBA highly appreciated"".   
So in short: The guys with their excel sheets trying to tell me when they will break even after spending big bucks for their top MBA are nothing short of hillarious. But I spend some 30k CHF one mine and I know that if it only scores me one job I would not have got otherwise was it very well worth the investment. The 30k will pay off much easier over my next 30 years of work life than the 200k CHF ones... 
I cannot say that I got my job through it - you always get a job cause you interview well. But I can say that it did help me to get interviews. Was it worth it? Only time will tell, but the chance is pretty good it was. It did give me a lot of business knowledge I use every day and was therefore important for me being prepared for the business role I have today. So if an MBA is right and if yes which one is extremely personal and highly depends on the personal goals, work experience, interests... End of story. No extreme position will do it justice and one claiming it is all rubbish does so the least.

			hi people, i called Les Ambassadeurs to ask for my jewellery to be valued - they told me that they can only value jewellery that have been purchased from Switzerland - jewellery from anywhere else in the world they simply cannot value.   
only Guebelin does valuing of jewellery -  
 it costs between 250-300CHF for one item (so if you have necklace, earrings and bracelet, then it'll be approx CHF 900! for valuing) - plus you have to leave the jewellery with them for 3 weeks!   
i'd rather just shop for more jewellery!

			Question of taste, but a man should have body hair, even if he's bald (many very good looking men are).. and woman should not. 
It's such a turn off to hear men speak about their hair removal (unless they're cyclists or swimmers, then it's understandable).   
It's awful to see a woman all dressed up in a smart skirt and suit, wearing sheer stockings and nice shoes..... with hairy legs.   
I had a very dark haired friend back in college, who actually always carried a pair of tweazers around in her purse, to remain picture perfect ! Ok it's an extreme, but I did understand her.

			Which do you mean?   
A:     
B:       
I tried B and it's horrible and wastes time IMO, and doesn't dry well. 
I prefer buying them separately, so when I finish one washing cycle I move the clothes to the dryer and wash another batch of clothes. 
Model B wouldn't help. And it doesn't dry, the clothes come out wet hot! 
Mine was LG.     
Once I was told never buy a multi tasking machine, it's NEVER good. 
It's true, I bought a multitasking curling/flat..etc iron from philips: 
similar to this one:     
and it sucks, very bad.

			I am guessing a bit clueless and not looking in the right places.   
Around here there is plenty on offer, just need to know where to look.  Not sure around Bern, but indeed have a look around and search in local language.    
For example-      theater school       amaetur theater        music conserveratoire       danse school   
There is also a 'school', more like an association offering cultural things for adults during the year here, but cannot find their website.  Things like photography, gardening, vistis to museums and the like.

			Hi, does anyone know where I can get wood stain markers in Zurich and what it is called in German?    
I discovered this really long scratch on my light hardwood floor and have been googling for what is best for covering scratches - tried wood fillers and scratch cover but don't seem to work either because the scratch is not deep enough or maybe I'm simply using them wrong. I'm desperate (yea..handover of apartment next week)! Been trying different DIY methods everyday the past  week but nothing worked.         
If I'm definitely doomed, an estimate of how much I would get charged for perhaps? The scratch is approx. 1metre along 12 small pieces of wood   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Mar 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Help..Wood Stain Markers:Scratch on Light Hardwood Floor	Rainsocks	Posts: 12

			I feel for you Tuhina. But you must see that unfortunately, having 'forgotten to pay' is the most commonly used excuse people give in such cases, and when not having a ticket for public transport, etc. The cost to us customers is huge- and what are the shops/police to do? If forgetting becomes a valid 'excuse' - what next?   
They will possible find it strange too that you paid for the cheap food items, but put the more expensive not food items in a place not easily seen, and forgot to pay for them, but not the cheap ones. I can truly see both sides here.   
I wish you the very best of luck and hope the authorities will accept your plea and treat you kindly, and that the matter won't go to court. I also agree that it may be best to tell your husband - but you are the only one who can judge this, knowing him best. Being a a foreign land without family and friends' support - with a husband who is 'less than understanding' must be very tough. Bonne chance - thinking of you. Odile

			You could easily make your own. Buy a white cover, cut out the cross shape. Dye the cover a bright red colour, sew the white cross back in. The Swiss flag is unusual as it is overall a square shape, and the white bit is made from 5 squares.

3178	17.08.2012, 21:14	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Yverdon	"    Thanks for the input, yes currently I am a non EU citizen, when I did my ATC training in the UK I was on a student visa, after my graduation I tried finding a field that could take me to validate my rating (even for free) but none was open to put me through the work visa application as I didn't have right to work in the UK. So that plan failed. After that I tried to do it back home but I was put in the endless loop of waiting for OJTI etc and that didn't work out. Now in about 3 years I will have a EU passport so that should be good news for searching a job, but I will be 30/31 so I don't think I should just wait, 30/31 is already late age for ATC even if you have the training.    
My thinking is, while working in Switzerland to start modular training in CH and get a CPL with IR in the next 3 years. I don't want to spend 45k in 6 months and have a low time CPL with non EU passport, plus with my wife working I don't think it's nice to be out of the country for long time. With staying here and doing it slowly as I work and spend cash on each flying, perhaps I will be more ""valuable"" with CH training and probably will be able to do some free hour building flying parachutes...   
Well crop dusting was just an idea, ideally I would be happy with being FI (although many pilots don't like it) or perhaps air taxi, I don't have aspiration on becoming line pilot so anything interesting daily job with CPL IR would be fun and worth having I think...I might be wrong of course.

			Just to state the obvious, there are 3 parts to a bed, matress, base and frame/headboard. If you buy a quality innerspring matress then then the base can be pretty basic as long as the matress breathes (and you rotate it regularly). One of the best deals on spring matress' is through   . If you do buy a foam matress then the base is more critical. For the frame it is for looks only so if you are happy with Ikea ect looks, go for it but it you want a quality, handmade frame/headboard at around Mobel Pfister prices, I will custom make one for you in any size/height combination. PM me or have a look at   for the style of my work but there isn't many bed photos there so I am happy to do a deal to get a few more photos on there.

			I spent the night before my wedding at a carol concert as it was December. It was great fun singing traditional carols followed by a mug of hot chocolate, then off to bed with my then faithful houndat the foot of the bed.   
Stag/hen parties were not in vogue then and to be honest I cannot understand the concept of getting so drunk that you can't remember what happened.   
My optician recently took his girlfriend for a romantic weekend to Prague and told me that the whole weekend was totally ruined by the antics of these ""stags"" and ""hens"". He advised me to go midweek if I wanted to visit.  "	an excellent reputation	Join Date: Apr 2011	Groaned at 13 Times in 8 Posts	How did/would/will you do it?	sarel	Posts: 360

Alternatively look for it at HSW (Hochschule Wädenswil). They will have it too.

			Hello all!   
I guess most people are looking forward to the street parade takes place in Zurich tomorrow, but, contrary to the anticipation of the techno-spirit, I am seeking for the peace of soul and mind that brings the sound of a piano.    
I have recently settled in Zurich to begin my career as a teacher, but I need to find a place to practice the piano. My last piano recital was in June 29th at the Hollywell Music Room at Oxford, Uk. Since then, I haven't touched a piano, due to my resettlement in Zurich, and I miss it so much!    
If anybody knows where I could possibly find pianos to practice or relevant information please write me. I would be grateful if I had a reply to this message.    
Thank you very much in advance.  
Best,    
Nefeli

			I think coming to Switzerland and expecting to live here without making any effort to learn the national languages is really a shame. Some thoughts: 
1) Take time off and learn either French or German, but really well, like total immersion. There are plenty of foreigners studying at Swiss universities and I'm sure that they don't all speak French and German fluently. 
2) If you really want to study in English and live here, look at distance learning. The Open University from the UK has an excellent reputation and very long experience at doing this. 
3) Law is going to be an odd subject for you to study here, as you'll learn Swiss law not US law.

			Thanks for the replies... I know how to make playdoh (and have already look up many recipes for that) My little guy loves playdoh and plasticine. Green/pink/yellow, etc. goo... I have also seen in stores here. Still not really what I am looking for. I am looking specifically for silly putty. It is really quite different from goo or playdoh... I loved peeling off newspaper print and all kinds of things with it. Blowing bubbles is awesome too! I have never really specifically looked for it but have kept my eyes open and haven't yet seen it. Maybe it is against the law or something... just another thing to add to the shopping list when I go back home

			I'm actually still curious about their ""Inter""Discount name ... online definition shows ""in·ter verb /inˈtər/  1. Place (a corpse) in a grave or tomb, typically with funeral rites - he was interred with the military honors due to him""    
Although, when I first heard the name, it sounded like they don't have many discounts but only a few here and there which is actually true    
A more fit name would rather be Lack-Of-Discount

But the basic equipment can be assembled for a few CHF: a street hockey ball, or tennis ball to start out, an stretch band, and maybe a purpose made roller, although I made mine out of some 5inch drainpipe tubing and under parquet floor liner for padding.   
One of the big concepts is that where the pain is might not be where the problem is, so you should work the whole ""chain"". So f.e. back pain might be a byproduct of tight hamstrings and quads

3229	04.08.2012, 00:47	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: US	"    There is quite a competition here with people coming from all over the world.  For the Bachelors/undergraduate I guess you need to prove that you have sufficient German knowledge, since almost all the classes are in German.  I think work experience is not expected since you're applying for undergraduate studies (right?), so it would probably boil down to grades and recommendation letters.  If you have worked in academics and/or published something (of decent quality) that would help.  Then there is the suck up ""statement of purpose"", I don't know how important that is here, I almost want to throw up from thinking about the time I wrote that letter.   
Like people are saying, living here is very expensive, and if I were you I wouldn't count on being able to work much alongside school.  As quark said, work hours are limited if you're here as a student, it's pretty hard to find a job here if you don't already hold some degree and the studies will probably be quite demanding and need a lot of time (depending on the person of course).  It's quite common for people to get a part time work at ETH but it might be trickier during the first years of the Bachelors.   
Good luck!

3230	02.08.2012, 17:29	Member	Thanked 53 Times in 19 Posts	Location: Vevey Montreux	"    I used to work in a 1-hr optical in the US. Chances are, you are not going to be able to get both polarized and anti-reflective in the same day, and if you do, it's probably not something you'll be happy with in the long run.   
The reason I say this, is that it is possible to get polarized lenses done in your prescription from the one-hour places, but they will need to grind the lenses to make them (if you need correction for astigmatism, it's only way to make sure the polarization lines up right AND the axis of the prescription is correct), so, then they still need the a/r coating. While I believe it is possible to get an in-house a/r coating these days (coated and cured probably), they tend to flake more if you don't treat them with kid gloves - and who really is oh so very gentle with their sunglasses?    
So far as whether you need both, it really depends on what uses you plan for them, and what your tolerance level is.    
Yes, the polarized lenses help for almost all conditions for daytime use, they cut the glare from the windows of other cars, from the street (esp bad if the street is wet) and for boating. As someone else mentioned though, it does make it tough to read some screens - such as the reading on the pump at the gas station, some digital watches, some cellphone screens, etc etc.    
The tolerance level for me is where the a/r comes in. I find seeing the reflection on the inside of my lenses very distracting, so, when I have the choice, I always have a/r on my glasses. It does make them a bit tougher to keep clean, and it is easier to scratch up than without, but it makes a difference to me, so I get it, but I understand why others may not.   
Finally - a piece you didn't mention and will likely make your sunglasses a ""definite special order""... mirror coating on the front. IF you are active on the water and IF you are active with winter sports, you may find it worth your while to also have a mirror coating on the front. (Which would make it mirror front, polarized lens, anti-reflective back) This will help against glare off snow and off bodies of water immensely - but it is costly and time consuming (but oh so fab)      <3   
I miss my old job some days, really really fiercely. (Yes, I did used to work for LensCrafters.   )        Sorry, but I just almost lost a lung to that. While you won't see them everywhere, there are Cartier and Tiffany and whatever designer with gem encrusted, platinum and gold and all sorts of hoopla types of frames out there. So. 400€ isn't really going to get you the ""most"" expensive (and many of us probably have too much taste to wear them, regardless of bank acct size), but it will get you some very nice ones anyhow.

			My local Landi re-seeded an area between the street and car park, so they could permanently demonstrate their offering - which appears to be similar to others around (not as big as some), but retails at less than 1500 chufs. 
It does seem to require a perimeter cable laying down - which might be a problem for anything other than a regular piece of lawn.          "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: Sep 2006	Groaned at 90 Times in 56 Posts	Robot automatic Lawn Mower: which one?	HAT	Posts: 1,248

			Hi all, apologies if this is the wrong thread for this topic, werent sure where to put it.   
Feel like I am continuously banging the same drum, but i have been pushed over the edge now. It surely can not be legal to act in the way this company has been acting, and surely one has rights so as not to be subjected to the continuous stress, frustration, worry, inconvenience and slight on ones credit history, thus potentially damaging future financial options etc.   
My issues with cablecom have been well documented on this site, but today I receive a letter which is threatening legal action against me, with a bill of circa 700chf, which is beyond comprehension. I am so tired of this now, it has been ongoing with this company for near 12 months since I moved last August and surely some action can be taken.   
I dont want to relay the whole story, as mentioned it is well documented on other cablecom threads, but does anyone know what rights I have?   
Surely, it cant be legal that a company just sends random invoices, provides other people a service your paying for despite billing you at your address. Then when realising they messed up, apologising, offering upgrade and credit, and when still not working offer new box but send it to wrong address. Then finally sort everything out, only to to reconcile invoices they have continually sent to an old address givin someone free cable, that they should of swithced off given my move, actually even admitting they messed up prior.   
I am at the end of my tether   "	null	null	null	Do I have legal options: cablecom	guest	null

The only problem with those starter packs is that the Miniatures are usually the most basic available. Some of them are the snap together ones. Not very interesting if you're into the modelling aspect of it. They tend to be aimed at the novice Gamer, as a foothold to get into the actual tabletop game.   
So they are worth it if you want to get started in the hobby, but if you already know what you are doing, then they are not much use.   
If you want to start building an army, and you already have experience with the Hobby (I'm assuming most people on this thread have a few years behind them) then your best bet is probably to buy the army specific Codex, then decide on what squads/Characters/vehicles you need and get them directly.   
If, like me, you just enjoy the miniatures, then browse the GW website, or Forge world and decide what you want to challenge yourself with next.   
Even Ebay can be great for getting loose Miniatures or sprues, if you're looking to do some conversions. It's also handy for tracking down Limited Edition Minis. If you're lucky, you may even find some of the 54mm Store Managers Christmas Present miniatures sculpted by Mark Bedford at a reasonable price. Although, in recent times, prices on these has begun to climb steadily, to the point where I saw a particular

			Hi All!   
I highly recommend the private bilingual day care/kindergarten in Oerlikon called Kid's Island:  . 
I personally was working there as a teacher and was extremely pleased with the system!   The only reason I left was to pursue my career as a psychologist.   
I can tell you from experience that it is a a very innovative kindergarten offering a private curriculum that integrates the public curriculum of Switzerland, montessori knowledge and materials, and offers the children vast opportunities to explore nature (Forest day, field trips) and they have the chance as well to take Ballet-Swimming-Yoga-Music-Art lessons during the week!   
The staff is multicultural, very friendly and professional. They also have experience with different cultural backgrounds and have prepared with supreme satisfaction all kids that have joined the First Grade.   
Good luck with the search and hope this information was helpful.

			Just thought I'd add my own experiences - thought that STEG was v good.  The website was useful in that it showed what stock there was in each of their stores.  I needed a case immediately - so could v simply get a list online of everything they had in stock and check what was available in the shop near Zurich. 
They seemed to have a good range of stuff in stock - useful as I've just finished building a dedicated gaming machine.   
I also found digitec frustrating - as per the above posts.  Tried to order a case from there first of all - it gave an estimated delivery date about a week away.  After 2 or 3 days they changed the order to show 'no delivery date'.  After phoning up I found that they expected it in ""3 to 4 weeks"" and told me that I couldn't cancel!  Fortunately in this case I had planned to collect it from their Zurich premises and pay cash on collection, so it wasn't an issue to explain that I would definitely not be buying the case from them even if they went ahead with the order!!

Not all US power bricks are ""dual voltage""  My Xbox elite one is, my older Arcade one isn't.  When we moved here I looked at the Elite, brick and was good but failed to check the Arcade.  Brought the Arcade one with me on the flight and Elite into the container.  Plugged it in (w/out the xbox plugged in) and POP it went.   
as for 60 to 240V? Omm, Do you mean 120/240V 50/60Hz?  That sticker says all!  UK is same voltage/Hertz rating as CH, so just a plug adapter or new standard computer power cord should do.   
OP, I think your power brick is just on it's last legs.  Get a new/used one from ebay or equivalent.  Make sure it's they right wattage rating.  For the non-slim xboxes, they have plug differences so you couldn't plug a lower wattage Brick into a higher-required xbox by mistake.   
If you have a 150W brick, you can use a 150W, 175W or 203W (maybe).  I know for sure a 175 will work on a 150W system.  Rule of thumb, use the same or higher rated power supply brick.  Check this WIKI page...       
Scroll down to List of Revisions.  the lower than 150W are the Slims I believe and use a totally different connector.

I asked in the post office in Kloten and they say they do not sell those anymore. Does anyone know where I can buy these coupons?    
Also I am not sure if these are the same as International Reply Coupons ?   
Thanks for your advice,

			There are several places in your neighbourhood; next door to Z im Park cafe on the corner of Zurlinden- and Zypressenstrasse is a young woman doing great framing work. On Badenerstrasse there's a chap between Zypressenstrasse and Lochergut with an overflowing shop with every imaginable frame and service you could need.

			I go to a place called 2nd Skin, in the Niederdorf ( ).  New branch with really skilled tattooists, and the staff are friendly, helpful and speak English if you need.   
Prices weren't too over-the-top for what I would've expected for Switzerland, but appropriate for the standard, professionalism, quality and effort you get (I paid between 120chf - 220chf but proportionate to my tattoos I think).  Been back 4 times to get tattoos from them.   
...And if you go, after your tattoo you can unwind with a drink in their attached bar!    "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Sep 2007	Groaned at 2 Times in 2 Posts	tattoos	kettering65	Posts: 18

			It costs nothing to put it on Ricardo or E-Bay for 7 days, with the reserve price being the price you want. You can see how many people looked at the table.  If it doesn't sell, then lower the price and try again for a week. You pay a small fee if you get a sale.

			I'm not sure where you live, but I know there is a poster/print shop at Stadelhofen (in downtown Zurich). Maybe they sell them, or at least could tell you where to find them. Another suggestion would be to try to find one of those printing shops -- the ones that will print poster-size photos for you.    
Or a FedEx or DHL store, if they have those here.

			The problem with these small portable units is the need to leave the window open, and thus letting the warm air inside.   
Another possibility is to attach the hose to the venting pipe in the toilet ceiling.  
Or to buy a piece of plywood which fits the open window frame exactly.  
Then cut a hole in the board and connect the hose.

If they are ready now, you can send tomorrow via courier and you can ask for them to arrive the next day.  If they are not ready yet, you should try to send by Thursday.  You can probably send on Friday to arrive Saturday, but the price might be much higher.   
Normal courier would cost up to £50.  Most have a minimum weight of 0.5kilo.     
Royal mail is good, but not necessarily the safest.   
White envelope can also be helpful, but dont break a leg to find one. 
Also write URGENT on it

			Thanks for the info guys. That was exactly what I was looking for!    
Hanger Rockin' one looks superb. Unfortunately I will be outside the country this weekend :/ 
Anyway, Hanger Rockin' is not listed in those link sent by bigblue2 so if there is anything else interesting going on this year and not listed, please update this thread. 
Thanks

			Hi all,   
I'm looking at moving to and working in Uster, near Zurich, from the end of August 2012 to the end of May 2013. I'm planning on doing a language course or two (definitely Italian, maybe some French or advanced German too if I have time) and joining a sports club or two (fitness, circuits, hillwalking etc) and am wondering if it would be worth my while registering at Zurich University for the year in order to benefit from student discounts, be able to attend classes there etc.    
However, as far as I can see a Gaststudium ( ) is going to cost me about 740 CHF per semester, maybe more (1,140 CHF?!) in the second semester, if I've understood what I read correctly ( ). I was also hoping to make use of some student travel discounts, but from what I can see they appear to be non-existent for Uni Zurich students - I've been advised to buy a 9-Uhr-Pass card for the year, but have also heard about the Halbtax cards, although I don't know if they would apply to my travels from Zurich to Uster.    
Doing a language course in Uster is going to cost me about 550-650 CHF for one semester I think, while the fitness class groups I was looking at there cost about 90-150 CHF each for the year. I've heard that the sport on offer at the University is pretty good (and is free, or doesn't cost much for students?)   
I'm also wondering if registering at the University would allow me to apply to live in subsidised student accomodation - if anyone has any links to such accommodation anywhere near Uster, I'd be very interested in looking at them.   
Maybe it sounds like I'm answering my own questions here, but if someone can confirm exactly how much registering at the university would cost me and give me any other reasons as to why I should or shouldn't do it (or any other advice in general, e.g. re travel above) I would really appreciate it.

			Hi all,   
I too am looking for an english speaking daycare or pre-school for my 20 month old. We found a place in glattburg so I'd like to find a place in the area or maybe oerlikon if it's not too far. 
I would appreciate if you could post some links to these daycares and/or pre-schools.   
I also don't understand much German (I count on learning the basics once I get there)   
My daughter understands and speaks in english. She understand some French but I ultimately like to find a place where she wouldn't feel lost.   
thankx so much

			An engagement ring is such a personal thing, I prefer simple any time. 
I think you need to check out your girlfriend's taste with maybe her friends and family, and don't forget about size, nothing worse than a romantic proposal (and acceptance) and then the ring is too small or too big.   
Good luck though, I hope she says yes.

			If you are talking about 'Personal Effects' which you have owned then I don't think there should be any duty to be paid even hough you are heading over into the EU as it would have been paid at the point of purchase originally (though I am sure others will correct). I would ask for a detailed quote from any removal firm which breaks down under what headings you are being charged. Watch out for 'Documentation' and Insurance as this can sometimes be slipped in twice by disreputable firms under other names.

			The hassle free solution is to get the stuff delivered and built by the deliverers. Ikea has a pool of deliverers and it seems to work pretty well mostly. I've done this several times with no problems. They came, they carried everything in, built the stuff miles quicker than I could have done it as they had experience of working with it. They also had extra bits like screws, bolts etc which saved someone having to go back and get missing parts. They went taking all the boxes with them. It obviously cost a bit more than arranging things yourself, but I reckoned it was worth it.

			I ordered furniture in a store nearby almost 3 weeks ago and was asked to pre-pay in cash. Delivery time was verbally agreed to 1-2 weeks.  
We had received a discount of 15 % (after asking for the discount; we had seen the same furniture in a different store for 15% less) and free delivery, so we thought we had done a good deal.  
It is important for me to know a date and approximate time since I'm working. I've called 4 times over the course of the last 10 days and every time I am told that it will be delivered one of the next days and that they will call me back in 5 minutes, the next day, .. with the date and time. Anyways, according to my last call, the furniture will be delivered tomorrow but they did not call me with an approximate time and they did not answer my calls today. Therefore, I decided to stop by at the store on my way home from work to ask for a time. There was nobody in the store, it was close to closing time. I asked for the time of delivery for the next day and the owner told me that there are no deliveries tomorrow but that they will deliver in 3 days. Since they keep delaying the delivery time, I asked to have this date in writing together with an approximate time. The owner became loud and angry and told me to leave his store because what was I thinking: if he says that it will be delivered, it will be delivered! I carefully stated that we had been given many delivery dates already and that I wanted it in writing this time and that if it was not delivered in 3 days, I want to cancel the order and have my money back. Then he became aggressive to a point that it scared me; he was yelling and spitting in my face, waving his arms around. I could not believe that a store owner would talk like that to a customer. I told him as calmly as possible that there is no need to become so aggressive towards a customer. But he kept cursing and yelling and telling me that I am wasting his time, that he will never give me my money back, that he will not write the delivery date on my order. It was not pretty. My spoken German is not good enough to reply and as I did not feel safe anymore, I left the store while he was still yelling and waving his arms. And why? Because I asked for a delivery date in writing?  
Not sure what to do now. I can be home in 3 days and hoping that it will be delivered. (I will make sure my husband is home as well) Or should I send a registered letter tomorrow with the agreed delivery time and ask for a refund if not delivered. I feel like cancelling the order; every time I think about the furniture, I see his aggressive face again and feel the spit in my face.  
I regret that I prepaid in cash; however this was expected with the 15% discount. I googled the store and this is what I found:  Not sure whether this is positive or negative and whether this might explain the aggressiveness when I was asking for my money back.

			We came here from Canada last summer. We shipped 5 boxes from Canada to our address here in Switzerland. We used Canada Post's slowest and least expensive shipping option. We did not use form 18.44. We indicated clearly on the boxes what the content was: personal items, clothes, personal documents. All old stuff. Shipping took 6 or 7 weeks. We shipped the boxes just before we left Canada. We traveled for 5 weeks in Europe before arriving at our apartment in Switzerland. The boxes arrived a week or 2 later. No fees, no taxes. Swiss Post delivered the boxes to our door.

			Since i came to Swiss, i have been quite interested in surfing for please, so the other day, i found this great place in martigny where people with surf in a small lake, and said to myself, ' gotta buy surfboard and try this '.  
So, can anyone recommend where to get one, since i am not pro, and probably going to use it till my curiosity fades, so i am not interested in buying a new/expensive ones.    
Thanks for the help.

			Well you get it at any  Migros or Coop, really, and if you need things out of the ordinary, go to a stationery shop.  I trust Basel is a big enough town to have those. Have you even tried and looked around?   
And the Germans words are Wasserfarben, Buntstifte, Zeichenblock/Malpapier.

			Just a quick update: I moved to a hotel after some sleepless nights and I have been assigned a new temporary accommodation. There has also been a conversation between the relocators/company and the police so they can keep an eye on the situation and make sure it doesn't escalate with other tenants.   
As for me, I'm exhausted after all the stress and the moving (with still a bunch of logistics to handle) but very thankful for all the support of the forum (public and privately) as well as my own company.   
My boss says it's good to start on the low-end so you manage expectations and things can only improve. Not sure I needed that, but I'm quite happy that this situation is pretty much solved, and looking forward for a new chapter in my life here in Zurich!   
Thanks for all the support!

			Hi there,   
I'm trying to find a real futon in Zürich (or least someplace that can deliver to Zürich). I don't want to spend a ton of money on it, but I'm willing to pay for quality.   
Some places (Conforama, for example) here advertise ""futons"", but they are not real futons; they are just cheap mattresses. It's the same story at Ikea, as far as I can tell.   
Can anyone recommend where I should look?   
Thanks, 
Lars

			Hello, my name is Maggie and I'm coming to Lausanne this summer to visit my cousin. Maybe I am going to work as a baby sitter or something, but I would like to learn more about studying in Lausanne. I am studying in Skopje, faculty of Translation and Interpretation. My mother language is Macedonian, my second language is English, and my third is French. I am 2nd year, and this year I would like to transfer in Lausanne. Can someone tell me if there is a way to continue my studies there, or maybe I could start from the beginning. Is there a department of studying English in the University of Lausanne? Do they offer scholarships for foreign students, and if they don't how much it will cost me for a year? Thank you.

			I would recommend SB Sports in Gland as having good choice and prices - just watch that you don't turn into the shop from the far side of the road and cross the solid white line or you could be fined.   
Rent for the season if you are unsure and you can change them if they are not right. My son had brand new boots which we could then buy at the end of the season for a good price.

			Hi there, 
I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and could offer any advice:   
I purchased the components for a new PC from Digitech (using a bank transfer as I don't have a CHF credit card yet). 
Upon receipt I noticed that 2 of the 4 memory sockets were faulty and arranged to return the motherboard to them for an immediate replacement.   
I returned the motherboard via swiss-post express and then several days later have got an email from Digitech saying that they will not replace the motherboard because there is physical damage (bent pins). They want to charge me 65 CHF to fix the problem (they haven't specified whether they mean fix the faulty memory sockets, or the supposed bent pins).   
I was very careful with the motherboard and am 100% sure that there was no physical damage to the motherboard when I returned it. I sent it in it's original packaging so I'd be surprised if it was damaged in the post. It seems to me that either they're making up the problem, or there is a minute bend in a pin and they're exaggerating the problem, or they bent it themselves.   
It seems to me that I am in a pretty weak position because they have the motherboard and my money. I've asked them for a more detailed description (and photos) of the supposed bent pins. I'd really appreciate any advice from someone who's had a similar problem or is a bit more familiar with Swiss consumer law.   
I've built many PC's over the past ~15 years and have never encountered a problem like this before.

			I've somehow managed to volunteer myself to organize a small work group event for 10 people with a budget of 900SFr. 
I originally thought about a team cooking event but the place I contacted wanted 220SFr pp not the 90SFr.pp which I have in my budget. 
It needs to be in or around the Basel area. 
The other ideas I had was a tour of the Basel underground or a Foxtrail but I need around 5 proposals to take back to the group and since the event needs to take place before the end of June I'm up against the clock.   
any/all ideas welcome!!

			Hi everyone,    
I am living in Singapore and have been thinking about a trip down to Switzerland for the longest time. And finally it is happening!   
I will be heading down to Zurich on the 28th June and will be around till 24th July. It will be my first time to Europe and I am infinitely excited.   
I am actually freelancing in Singapore, and finding my way around what kinds of jobs I'd like to be doing. I have videography and photography experience and have been shooting weddings for a bit now.    
If there is an opportunity for a photoshoot/discussion during the period that I am in Zurich, it'll be amazing.   
Here's some of a rough portfolio that I have yet to compiled together:             
Because I am a newbie to the forum, I cannot reply to more than 4 private messages in 24 days. So any couples who would like to have a discussion can do it here, or to my personal email at derekfmz(at)gmail(dot)com   
Cheerios! 
Derek

			Ciao a tutti.   
I've been checking this forum, as well as:   
- luganoannunci.ch 
- tutti.ch 
- internations   
It seems there are always people moving in and out of Ticino with loads of expats...  What is the best way to outfit one's kitchen / new apartment -- quickly, and relatively cheaply (without having to drop a few pretty CHFs for disposable items at Migros etc.)?  It seems the quality-price ratio is effectively a bit skewed against the consumer, but I would take aged quality over cheap crap any day!     
For example, I was hoping to take over an old cast iron pan because they are AWFUL to move with, but for me can also double as bakeware     which is great because I need both immediately.       
Am I missing some key or major way the expat community loads and unloads its goods?     
Or should I just trawl markets across the border in Italy for haggling practice?  (If so, which ones?)     
Grazie mille

			It's possible that you'd be offered healthcare. Some companies do, but most don't. You need to ask your HR for the full details of the offer. It's possibly a negotiation point. Cost starts at around 200 CHF a month for basic cover.   
Check out homegate.ch for sample accommodatoin near Lausanne. Depends obviously on size and location of apartment. Yes, service charges can be high. You pay x amount per month then an annual adjustment.    
This is quite a complex subject as although the service charges are high, it includes things utilities you may be used to separate bills for. If you search the forum you'll find a ton of discussion on these subjects.   
CHF 90K was just a stab in the dark but I'd have thought that might be roughly 53K NL Euros in terms of cost of living. I may be off the mark. Of course you also have to factor in the value of the benefits which can be hard to compare.

			Hi there, I need advice.   
I have started preparations (saving money) for my goal of moving to Switzerland in 2014. A little about me:   
I hold a Bachelors Degree in Finance which I received Spring 2011. I currently work at an insurance company handling commercial claims. Currently I am studying German  at a local college (I understand there difference between Swiss-German and High German). Additionally I plan to take the CFA Level I exam in January of 2013 (will this play in my favor through the admission process at all?). The University of Zurich offers Master Programs in Quantitative Finance and/or Economics and Business Administration which is what I am interested in. Univ of Zurich is my first choice but not only (in case I do not get accepted I have a few other programs in mind).   
I am originally from Europe (Bosnia born, grew up in Serbia) however I am a U.S. citizen via naturalization.  I hope to stay in Switzerland afterward and seek employment.   
How reasonable does this sound? What advice do you have for me?   
Thank you in advance.

I'll never forget sitting in a sauna in Badenweiler, when a guy I work with walked in. I sat it out for over 20 minutes, with my hair over my face but then I got a stiff neck and was about to die from the heat, so ran out making a big Zorro-type movement with my towel.

			You have to arrive at the customs post during opening hours. There may be a queue of lorries - queue up until it's your turn.   
I'm a bit confused about the VAT and duty bit. Are you bringing things that are not part of your ""household goods""? Are you bringing a car that you own for less than six months? Are you bringing more than 200 litres of plonk? If the answer is ""no"" in each case, chances are you won't have to pay anything. But all of this is on the first page of Form 18.44 (guidance notes) or on the Swiss custom office's  .

			Here is my two-pence:   
As a triptic, I think there is something going on there. It would be   good to see how the interaction between the three pieces could be   developed. It would also be great to see some more depth within the   painting field (I know art representation is tricky, so apologise if the   depth is already there but just not coming across in the photos) --   Kristin Baker is the first artist who comes to mind who achieves this   excellently with acrylics:     Seeing this piece in person, and even in that photo, you can see that   she really pushes the transparency of this medium to its limits,   saturating the work with movement.   
As MiniMia points out, the term ""starving artist"" is not just a  cliché,  and doesn't only apply to financial side of the career choice.  It  sounds as though you wouldn't be on the bread line if you didn't  sell,  but becoming a full-time artist can nevertheless be quite  punishing. It  sounds easy, but managing your workflow and time as an  artist   (particularly when you are at the behest of the mercurial  creative  flow!), with no structure at all from a course, commission or  private  tutor, is incredibly demanding mentally and emotionally (knowing  some  artists, I would even go so far as to say existentially also!). More  so,  when you are trying to push your work to the next level.   
As part of preparing for a career-change to Architecture, I practised   art full-time myself for just over a year. Like you, I had a narrow   formal education in it. I worked in artists' studios in Hackney, London   alongside full-time ""career"" artists, and saw first-hand what a   challenging lifestyle. For the most part, artists were struggling to   even get enough time in the studio, for all the time they had to spend   second-jobbing (a good proportion had had to sign-on to the dole at some   point in their careers too) and networking with gallerists. Some of   their work was exceptional but they remained in this frustrating balance   -- i.e. even great work far from guarantees that you'll get the   audience you want.   
I am definitely a believer in pursuing a career you are passionate   about, but again as MiniMia says, being an artist is really a lifestyle.   Naturally the line between all vocations and one's life outside work   can become extremely blurred. As an artist, the line just doesn't exist   (in my opinion anyway). It's a way of viewing the world, of  interpreting  it, of responding to it, of grafting onto it,  reinterpreting your  response, taking it apart, starting again, etc. The  decision to earn  money as an artist (cynical attempts to pander to  trends in buyers'  taste aside), is a decision to live differently  full-stop.    
As such, I'd say that whether or not you move in this direction really   depends on what you hope to get from it. (Sounds obvious but can often   be taken for granted!) If you find the act of creating art per se very   rewarding, and more so than you could imagine finding anything else, and   would still do it regardless of how much money you'd make, then do it!  If  whether or not you do it depends in part on how successful you  think  you would be, I would spend as much time as you can right now  getting  out there and (re-)seeing as much art as possible -- in the  galleries,  private collections, museums etc. Throughout, honestly ask  yourself  whether you believe you could work towards producing something  that  could stand its own alongside any of the pieces you like or  admire.  (And ideally, go out with a sketchbook and respond to the work as you experience it.) Without this conviction in your own work, I'd say it'd be very  difficult  to sustain this kind of career choice.   
I hope the above helps!

The fight didn't happen at the time of the horse fair did it? That is the single time of the year I can remember any trouble.   
I'd say that drunken late night brawls are something that happen pretty much in any country that allows late night drinking. I made the assumption that the OP saw something in the middle of the day. Maybe that was an incorrect assumption.   
In terms of violence though, Switzerland (Zurich area) is really no better than most of Europe. I've seen a kid kicking and punching a stranger on the number 4 tram in Zurich (the guy and another handled him). I've been caught up in the middle of a massive crowd fight at a Rapperswil-Jona vs Ambri ice hockey game. I've also been seen fights at train stations around Zurich, mostly to do with Ice hockey or football. I deliberately worked from home on the 1st of May rather than travel in to Zurich.   
I have seen more violence in 11 years of living in the Zurich area of Switzerland than I did in the same period of time living in the Cotswolds. I haven't lived in any of the large UK cities so I really can't comment on the level of violence there. I just dislike where I come from being tarred with the same brush.

			Yes, it's the EU membership that counts in this case. Any EU resident can order (buy) without paying additional tax from any EU country (because they pay the tax levied by the country of origin of the sale).

			Your probably thinking of something more recent but, if not, Jean-Jacques Rosseau's'Confessions' and'Reveries of the Solitary Walker' might interest you. 
They stem from somewhere around 1764, so obviously don't have too much current relevance.

			I have   mixed feelings about most modern architects and architecture, not just the Swiss ones (although the apparent Swiss architect love affair with concrete may have cooled a bit, but it's not over...)   
Terry Pratchett made an observation along the lines of "" ""   
Covering modern buildings with day-glo is rather like dressing a pig in an Armani suit... The threads are swell, but underneath is still swine...   
Does anyone else get the feeling/impression that many modern architects after designing unworkable and unlivable ""cutting edge, daring and innovative"" buildings happily go home to the equivelant of a beautiful Grade II Georgian  house? Cos they rarely seem to live or work in the buildings they design (but I'm probably just being a bit old fashioned and curmudgeonly...And a bit biased)

			Since this thread may stick around,   sells Perspex sheets in many different sizes and 2mm/4mm thicknesses are pretty standard.

			Hi everyone ! 
I live near Luzern and I am very much into doing different types of jewellery (especially love earrings and Dreamcatchers) and also any other interesting things: like any sort of hanging arty thing for walls, balconies, gardens etc. 
But I am struggeling in here to find some craft supplies like lots of different types of beads, yarn, metal-and wooden rings (for Dreamcatchers), leather strings etc. I have got some stuff from the Brockly but it's not enough. 
Does anyone know a good shop with a wide variety craft supplies in Luzern or Emmen/Emmenbrücke (or near by) and not so expencive (should be a problem in Switzerland, huh? )? Or maybe good and cheaper one from the online (without a huge postage fee). And also do you know where and how to sell my crafts in some fairs - is there somekind of information somewhere about those things? I am struggeling to find it myself as my german is not so good, either . 
Any help is very helpful and if anyone is interested what I am making- then you can see my work in here (it's at the moment in estonian language though , but it will improve):      
P.S. I also sell all my stuff and I do any orders- my imagination and skills has (almost ) no limits. So - if anyone is interested about anything-please let me know and we can arrange about what and the price  also (which is very reasonable). I am also a holistic beauty- and massage therapist (incl. manicure, crystal healing etc.) (studied in UK), so...  
P.P.S. Also  - does anyone know if there are some estonians in Luzern, Kriens or near by? 
THANK YOU!!!

3505	01.05.2012, 23:53	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Right. Should be mentioned in any camera manual.      The ability to control aperture and the relationship between focus distance and dof does not depend on the camera being an SLR or not. The same holds for the sensor size.       
again- thats equivalent to discussing differences between lenses of eg Micro-FT cams or rangefinders (Voigtländer vs. Leica vs. Konica and all the other old M39 lenses). No specific SLR topic.      right. Read the manual.       No specific SLR topic.      No specific SLR topic.      Which accessories would you say are SLR-specific? Tripods? Filters? Flashes? Not really.      I have no relation with GAF, nor have I taken any course there. GAF is not a business, but a non-profit co-operative of autodidactic photographers that organizes courses for its members. I am also not saying that beginners courses are useless, I'm just saying that there's hardly any reason to do a specific (D)SLR course. The basics of photography are independent of the type of camera used.

			Hello,   
I was wondering if someone could help me with a big problem I am facing. 
I am in my last year of doing A Levels (UK high school diploma) and they probably will not be so good, so I am looking now at Universities or Business Schools in Switzerland with low entry requirements but still good teaching ( I am planning to do a Bachelor in Business Administration).  I used google the last days and did not find any good answers, so I was hoping that you could help me.  
The area doesn't really matter and the course should be in english. I am aware that probably only private universities would accept me, but I always wanted to go to one anyway!   
I appreciate every answer,   
Thank you

			Hi,   
Prompted by the experiences of another forum member I am planning to paddle my SUP board the length of the Rhine across Switzerland in a couple of weeks.  I'll finish in Basel so need some tips on the following.   
I need a place to leave my car for a few days ready for my arrival. Must be close to the river, with a place I can easily get out of the water, and carry the board and my kit to (SUP boards are large and unwieldy).  Also, parking should be free, so no risk of tickets or towing, and safe.  And finally need to be able to get to the train station reasonably easily (so I can get back after dropping the car off).   
Any suggestions much appreciated!

			Hi everyone,    
about two days ago we started to get strange telephone calls from a Russian phone umber: 007495001234. 
A recorded voice speaking English with a light Russian accent was saying the following sentece: 
""Can you hear me...? May I speak to Mike, Mike Hutchinson?""   
A quick googling showed that this recorded message is annoying people from all over the world. It is not clear what is the purpose of these weird calls, but nevertheless be aware of it. I am planing to call cablecom and ask them to block this number, and on worst case, I'll have to change my land line number.

			Hi There   
Preferable a works visa which would allow you to work but also stay in CH for a  nominated period. Normally if it is your first application and they do grant a permit, it will be a L permit which can be valid for 1-2 years. Not too sure if the internship covers a student visa.   Going parallel with the visa/permit is that you will need to have a medical aid.    
Best Of luck. It takes time but it sure worth it.   
Bye

I am kindly asking if any of you know of any good venues that could accommodate about 80-100 women, from 9am - 6pm, opened on a Saturday and with possibly two other rooms where workshops can take place?    
Please feel free to DM.   
Thank you.

			I think the OP means either a thermos that holds hot water so you can open it up and put the baby's bottle in the hot water to warm it, in which case you generally need one thats bigger than a standard thermos; or she means the insulated bags that you can get for baby's bottles - any insulated bag will do the same job but you get can some that are specifically made for certain sizes/brands of bottles so may possibly be more effective (I don;t know, never had one).    
My advice is, if you only want one specific thing, try and order it online from a shop (eg Amazon) in UK/Germany etc, as it will likely fall below the threshold at which customs start charging you import duty and will save you a trek over the border.

Does anybody know where to find good Viennese Waltz / Jive teachers or classes in Zurich/around Zurich? (for Jive I'm looking for a more advanced levels)   
Do you know about any (non-private) classes which are being taught in English?

			I do not buy much for myself but I would like to treat myself to some sunglasses. To me they are a lot of money (about CHF300). 
I say that because everyone on here seems to earn a fiortune compared to me.   
I have been looking at Persol Sunglasses and wondered:   
(1) would it be cheaper to buy them in Switzerland or UK or even Italy. 
(2) are buying them on-line generally cheaper 
(3) any suggestions on shops.

			Hi Sbrinz...........thanx very much for your reply to my question. I have looked at the information about the Priory and about Hans Erni.

			As the others have posted this is still in service. You may send a letter or a parcel for free if the recipient is in the military service. Of course this had been started in an area without mobile phone, laptops and even internet (how could we even live back then  ) and used to be very popular. As a girl I didin't do military service but used to send both parcels and letters to male friends and it was always nice to receive a letter or postcard from them - sometimes also unexpectedly   good memories!   
regarding the Fresspäckli in camps: we used to tell parents at the scouts that any content would have to be shared so most parents sent a cake or cookies and maybe some other sweets.

			just a couple of clarifications:   
1. Ikea home delivery is 99 CHF at min, or 12% of price of goods purchased, whichever is higher. This is for dietlikon Zone 1, i.e. closest to IKEA. Used it twice, they delivered within 24 hours both times. Check here for prices/alternatives:    
(Also: bottom of that page has info on van rental and what number to call for reservations)   
2. Another alternative which I don't see on that page : I was offered the alternative of a taxi. It's a van, essentially, with a driver to take you and your stuff home. Price varies with distance. If he helps you with the unloading, you pay something extra (like 20CHF more or so). There are apparently different van sizes, too..Maybe a good idea to call ahead for this service, as well.   
on line stores may be able to send you stuff home (like an iron, etc.) I believe, that Migros electronics does ( ), for example, but I have not used the service myself. 
Also, sites listed in   are generally able to ship to your home.   
good luck,  
J.

			My sister in law lives in Seen and my husband and I will too from June onwards. Too bad that the allotment you wanted is not available. Perhaps try again in Autumn/Winter as it is the low planting season and more allotments might be available. I haven't yet applied for one, but I would love to share an allotment with someone.   
Did you also try for allotments on Eisweiherstrasse which is just nearby Waldeggstrasse? Other Püntens near-ish to your area in Winterthur are on Hulfteggstrasse, Breiteholzstrasse and Jonas Furrer-Strasse. But I think the closer it is to where you live, the better of course. Who did you contact btw?

			Hello Forum,   
I've been in Basel less then a month and I need some suggestions about finding a good, not too expensive, English speaking hairdresser. The location is not really an issue, since it's so easy to get around Basel and it's not too large a city. Most importantly she/he needs to be able to speak English, since, unfortunately, I don't speak any Swiss German ( or German for that matter.)  
All suggestions are greatly appreciated!!   
Thank you all in advance!   
Molly

			Hi everyone:   
I would like to buy some art related to Switzerland--maybe a something by a Swiss artist or with a Swiss theme.     
In my area (Zurich), I know of a few galleries, but they seem very touristy (i.e., at Paradeplatz, Bellevue, close to Stauffacher).  I'm no art expert, but I'm not looking for something that isn't too gimmicky.   
Can anyone suggest a gallery or artist I might want to try?  Thanks a lot.

			i own more than a dozen of watches (Rolex, Omega, Breitling etc..) and I had the same question when I moved here. It seems you cannot get any discount from the AD or resellers here, this make the watches more expensive than abroad sometimes.  
However, the good thing of living in Switzerland is that I can go visiting some watch factories and independent manufacturers and ""window shopping"" is eye watering!    
150 bucks for a MOVADO is a honest price, go for it if you like the model. Do not expect that its value will increase in the future, this happens only for Rolex and Patek.

			In the garden:   
1. Organic fertilizer: Sprinkle them in the soil of plants that love acidic soils, especially rosebushes, rhododendrons, camellias, evergreens, carrots, and radishes.   
2. Organic pest and ant repellent: Sprinkle areas where ants, slugs, and snails hang out and destroy your garden.   
3. Organic cat repellent: Yes, I love cats, but if you want to keep them out of your plants and garden, coffee grounds will do the trick.   
4. Mushroom growing soil: Inoculated mushroom plugs nestled into moist coffee grounds can mean a great mushroom crop for you. Put grounds in a glass container and press a mushroom plug into them, repeating with more grounds and mushroom plugs until you run out of room. If you see mould, just remove it.   
5. Bait worm life support: Add coffee grounds to soil to help keep bait worms alive longer.   
In the house:   
6. Closet deodorizer: Old pantyhose plus coffee grounds equals a sachet to keep your closet free of odours.   
7. Refrigerator and freezer deodorizer: Place ground in a small cup and in the fridge or freezer much as you would baking soda.   
8. Pin cushion filler: If you still use pin cushions (like I do), dried coffee grounds are a great filler for the cushions.   
9. Abrasive cleaner: For stubborn grease and stains on pots and pans, coffee grounds really get in there and do the job.   
10. Dust deflector: Were talking about the fireplace here; sprinkle coffee grounds on ashes before you start collecting them to minimize the dust. I *love* this tip and use it often.   
11. Furniture scratch toucher upper: Use a Q-tip and coffee grounds to fill in scratches on wooden furnitureremember the coffee will stain the wood a bit, so dont use it on something that wont match.   
12. Drain cleaner: Be careful with this one as you dont want to clog your drain with coffee grounds! *But* to counter odors coming from your drain, you can pour about a half a cup of coffee grains down the drain followed by boiling hot water to get the grounds through. No more smells!   
13. Meat tenderizer: This is one for leftover coffee as opposed to coffee grounds; soak steaks in coffee to tenderize and for an interesting added flavor.   
14. Chocolate cake flavourer: Used grounds and fresh grounds both give a little kick to chocolate baked goods, including brownies.   
In your beauty routine: for fun   
15. Hand soap: Rub grounds on your hands to get rid of stubborn odors like onion and garlic.    
16. Face mask: An egg white mixed with 1/4 cup grounds makes a great exfoliating face mask.   
17. Hair rinse: After washing your hair, rub in coffee grounds for shine, softness, and even a bit of colour for those of you who are dark-haired; remember coffee grounds act as a dye, so if you have light hair, unless you want highlights, this one isnt for you.   
18. Cellulite rub: Mix one tablespoon of olive oil with 1/4 cup moist, warm coffee grounds and spread on cellulite hot spots. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap, leave on for a few minutes, and then remove wrap and shower as normal. For best results, do a couple times a week. If anyone tries this, you *must* let me know how it turns out.   
For MORE fun:   
19. Dye: Use a mix of coffee grounds and water to dye clothing, paper, or even Easter eggs.   
20. Tattoo base: Make homemade temporary tattoos using coffee grounds and henna.   
And finally, on your doggie:   
21. Dog flea dip: I havent had the nerve to try this one yet, my dog is white.....but apparently apply after the shampoo and rinse routine.  "	made some interesting contributions	Join Date: Jul 2007	Groaned at 2 Times in 2 Posts	Recycle Coffee Grounds (and Coffee) 21 ways	ozibird	Posts: 151

			Your first step is to fill in the forms and send them off - you then receive a card in your name through the post. Present this to the cashier when you next do your shopping and you'll get a customs slip stapled to your receipt (it will be printed with your name and address). When crossing back over the border get this customs slip stamped at the German customs booth, remember to present your documentation (For EU citizens apparently it's passport and 'b' permit, I found this out during a 10 minute discussion with a rather rigid customs guy at Grenzach Whylen crossing). 
Next time you go to Aldi put the till receipt and stamped customs slip into one of the envelopes they give you and then into the 'letter box' in store.  
The Refund is then deposited directly in your bank account.   
It sounds complicated but it's dead easy - first thing to do though is fill in the forms that you pick up in store and send them off to be processed and get your card.

			Yes, it is store specific.   
There is nothing in the Swiss Law about right to return or refund.   
Most shops nowadays take returns.   
Some like Manor, Media Market, Interdiscount, Fust etc. have a ""no questions asked"" policy.   
In other smaller shops you'll have to explain why you want to return it and they put this on the returning slip.    
Some other shops allow you to do exchanges or give you a buying credit but not your money back.   
Finally there are shops that doesn't take returns at all.   
I bought some photographic equipement from an specialized shop in Geneva, tested it, didn't like it and wanted to return it the next day. They simply didn't accepted returns, when I told them that the customer had right to return, they told me it is not a right that the swiss law or commercial pratices give me, it is just the choice of the shop to do it or not.   
In any case they will register your name and address when you do the return and then if they verify that the item you returned is defective or something is missing and it is your fault, they can ask you to asume responsability on the dammage.

			HI Sam,   
I understand you posted this message quite some time ago, but in case if you still think you need any info on cost of living in Zurich, well her goes. I am also a masters student in ETH, so I guess I would be able to say that 3000 chf is more than sufficient for two people to have a healthy living in ZUrich. Since you are planning to stay together, the rent you have to pay individually will be considerably less compared to what I pay, say around 700-800 chf (will be less if you manage to find a cheap student room), and the monthly food costs (assuming you dont eat out often) will be around 400 chf for the both of you (give or take 100 chf depending on what you buy), and the transportation costs in Zurich alone will be 500 chf for 1 year for a person if you are less than 25 years of age. And I am guessing you already have an European insurance provider, so hopefully it will be recognised in Zurich so that you dont have to pay more for that as well. And everything added you have somewhere around 1400 chf for two of you so far per month. So you have plenty of money left for entertainment, drinks, your study related things etc etc..     
In case I missed something regarding costs, I am sorry, but otherwise I think thats pretty much it. Hope it helps.   
Matt

			There is a small but beautiful shop in Zug called ""Sara Schlumpf"". I think she is a designer making tailor made dresses although there seem to be some ready-made dresses inside (never went inside the shop). I always stop to watch the dresses in the window and they are really very very nice. There is no price displayed though, so I have no clue what price range we are talking (reason why I probably never went in).

There are other dance classes at the same place and you can see a schedule on the website, in the gymnastikstudio section.  Website    Hope this helps!

			Hi again, so I found the best solution.... is not ordering from where my mom works because we just ordered from Overstock.com. I didn't even know that they shipped to Switzerland so it is pretty cool. The prices are SO GOOD. We looked at rings in Switzerland and the prices are so much higher. We saved tons of money buy ordering on Overstock.com and the taxes and duties were already included and guaranteed that we won't have to pay anything more.

			Hello Katrien,   
Sorry I have just seen this.   
No I haven't been to the knitting group, I had been umming and ahhing over whether to join the Women's group (you can't go to any of the sessions without becoming a member of the IWCL) and in the information they sent me most people appeared to be 20 years older than me and I was wondered (could be wrong) whether there was a religious slant to the group which I wouldn't care for.  All in all I didn't feel it was for me on reflection, that's not to say it wouldn't be perfect for you!

			Hello! 
I found by incidence this forum because I'm looking in the moment for a PhD opportunity in the UK.   
IronAngel: Did you find out which swiss grading is equivalent to a british first class honours degree? Does the swiss grading only consider the Master's grade or also incluedes the Bachelor grading????   
Thanks for clarifying. I read the whole thread...but it seems that the topic shifted more or less to the funding. Still, beforehand I would like to know if I can meet the basic criteria.

			We amazed ourselves by managing quite happily without a car. When first arriving we signed for a parking space fully expecting to buy a car. I rented one for our first 3 weeks here and eventually decided against it because:   
1) Parking space cost CHF 150 per month. 
2) Add on insurance and youré basically at at least 3 grand a year before you even have a vehicle. 
3) I found driving here quite joyless and a hassle in comparison to most other places because of the very restrictive speed limits and the considerable cost of parking when you reach your destination. Also the parking spaces can be hard to find and are miserably tight. 
4) The train station is 200m away and takes us most places in Switzerland at least as quickly as the car. Exceptions are e.g. Murren which is a very convoluted journey by rail . 
5) The price of cars was fairly unattractive. 
6) We weren't using our rental car much.   
Whilst at first it seemed very strange not having a car available at any instant we got used to it quite quickly. Now other people find it far more strange that we don't have a car than we do. We rent a decent motor when we want to visit foreign countries (e.g. a BMW 335d is great fun for German autobahns and can be picked up very cheaply just over the border  ) and put the money we save by not running our own car into a kitty which enables some great foreign travel!   
The one downside I would agree with that has been repeatedly mentioned in this thread is that we are less likely to get out and about in Switzerland (e.g. into another canton) than we would if we had our own car. The thought of jumping on public transport on Saturday morning, in truth for us, just is not as appealing as climbing into your own car.

			Hello!   
I just went last week to the 3 days (in my case 2) of recruitment from the Swiss army. I went to Rüti ZH. Had to do a bunch of pscicological tests and a pretty easy sport one.    
I met there a fellow ""Swiss - expat"" / Swiss from abroad who also had to go there and was a bit confused with how it exactly works.    
So I was wondering if anyone needs any information about it. I could also give you some hints of how to come get more points in sport    
Bests, 
Jonathan

			It will only cover EMERGENCY hospital treatment- so if she had an 'emergency' but then needed long-term hospital treatment and recovery, it would not pick up the tab- and neither would it cover repatriation so she could have long-term treatment and recovery back in UK etc (let's say, bless her cotton socks and all fingers crossed, if she had a stroke or heart attack, etc). Just not worth taking the risk not being covered.

			You can fill in the Anmeldeformular on their site and (if I remember correctly) they will email you your customernumber with the adress etc. When ordering things from Amazon or etc you give your Name c/o LAS Burg + customernumber, adres etc... LAS-Burg email you when the delivery has arrived. On your first visit  there you'll have to have your ID with you and  you will get a plastic card from them and will have to give them a pincode for your pass. Getting the next parcels you can use the card and identify yourself with that pincode so no ID needed any more. I don't remember paying anything for the card and you pay a small fee per parcel (depending on the size). For me it has worked perfectly every time!

It is located on the road from Au up the hill where the American school is at the top. Cost 1000chf for the week as I recall.

			I can totally understand why some prefer not to cross the lines and keep their professional and private lives completely separate.    
However, from direct experience, I think it's very possible to become good personal buddies with someone you met via work.  One just has to take time about it and not rush as that could be a costly mistake...     
The work/personal buddies crossover has happened to me here and in UK, albeit over quite a long period of time eg hanging out at work during coffee breaks, lunch, work organized events.     
Then at some point its moved almost imperceptibly to the personal stage such as hanging out in the evenings or at weekends sometimes eg cinema, shopping, lunching, parties, BBQs etc.   
Even though they or I have moved on to pastures new, we remain good friends, some of these quite some years later.  The important factor is that we took the time to get to know, like, trust and respect one another as work colleagues first and only then moved on to becoming personal buddies from there because we shared similar girlie interests and stuff.   
One of my best friends, an American and based in New York, is someone I met through work in the early 90s.  One of the loveliest holidays I've ever had was was when I spent Thanksgiving one year with her and the family.  It was absolutely awesome.

			As mentioned, I do sing in a choir, and it has proven to be a very easy way of making new friends. We practice in Altstetten, sing mainly ""classical"" music, and we are always looking for new singers, especially men (like most choirs).  We sing in German, Latin, Italian, French, English - but have also done rare languages such as Icelandic (which I am sure sounded horrible to any native). So, if you are interested, check out   or let me know.

			Hi EF-ers!   
I just bought my first remote controlled plane a few days ago, and have been frustratingly trying to fly it, but without too much success. I contacted a local club, but they never replied, most probably because they are a closed-circle French-speaking group.   
So, if there is anyone interested in helping me out with a few face to face tips or such, I would be more than glad to meet up with them.     
Thanks!

They do different versions of the Irresistible range throughout the year as well.   
I also enjoy Hugo Boss - Sunset and Paco Rabanne - Black XS as it has slight undertones of chocolate mmmm.

			They hibernate between the windows - in the seals and along nooks and crannies by skirting boards, etc. Now Spring is here, they've woken up- hurray. Take a piece of stiff paper and gently lift them onto it and release them so they can go out and eat all the other kritters like green fly, etc. They do a great job- vive le Printemps. We had the same in the UK btw.

			Hi, I sent these guys an e-mail    in German.  I also called in at the Brocki haus in Oerlikon and told them I had a table to gift and some other stuff.  They called, made an appointment to come round, then a guy turned up, looked at the stuff, decided what he wanted, filled out a form, set a time for collection.  I guess they don't always want to send a van when they don't know if they want the stuff.  They came and took it all away.  The stuff they don't want they also offered to take and dispose of for me for 40 CHF,.. I declined, but it's an option.

			Dear Jelena Maravic,   
Most of the comments made by the other guys are correct! Being an amateur astronomer and co-founder of my towns ''astro'' club gave me the opportunity to learn quite a lot about star-gazing and telescopes. 
I am happy to share this knowledge with you, and others who will later read these lines. 
The most important facts you need to consider are:   
1) whats the budget 
2) what do you want to look at (deep space or planets) 
3) where do you want the eyepiece to be (on the side or at the bottom) 
4) where will we put it 
5) do we want it to be portable 
6) will we use a camera with it (as Itzoe already wrote!)   
Then in order to do something except moon gazing you will have to buy some book, there are a lot out there! I would recommend you some if you send me a p.m. (there are some that have maps of the sky, comparing and analysing types of telescopes, basic principles in astrophotografy e.t.c.) Then it's a good idea to find some ''astronomy club'' who will give you additional info in whatever you need, and good company if you 're making a nightwatch somewhere besides your home! (Believe me when you're hunting places with no light-pollution you would better not be alone) we usually go stargazing in couples because of the animals (dogs,bears e.t.c.)    
And of course there are plenty of sites and programs for your p.c. helping you   with additional information!  
Hope i helped!

			Usually, the connection diagram is printed on a label that is attached close to the terminal box on the appliance, and also in the installaton manual. The connection can be configured in a multitude of ways, usually by changing some links in the terminal box.  The exact configuration depends on what supply is available (single phase, three phase, with or without neutral)       
I would highly suggest to get an electrician to do this. Otherwise, the equipment may not operate as intended, or - worse - may be left in an invisible, dangerous condition.   
Cheers, 
Chris

			Dear All,   
I am asking for help, suggestions and some pieces of advice. I am planning to continue my studies and I found a business course at the University of St. Gallen. Actually, I want to do their MBA Program but I am still young and do not have enough experience. I was offered their ""MBA Preparation course"" called Essentials of Management:         
As I want to work for international trading and change my career platform as soon as possible, I need to study some more Business Administration in order to get in to this industry and understand the daily business.   
I am kindly asking your opinion if this course would worth making as well as the return of investment. Will it help me to get a good job in my preferred industry or increase my salary? If you were me, would you go ahead and start  it now or do you have any better suggestions?   
Thank you very much for your kind help in advance   
Very best regards   
George

Still, it will be light-years better than the results from an iPhone, and I'm assuming that that the OP's budget doesn't stretch to dedicated primes.

			Is it mostly 'junk' mail or proper letters, just one type or mixed?  
If it's proper letters, it might it be someone trying to track someone else down and they've found your name and address in the local phonebook so thought they'd try their luck.... 
In which case have you considered opening one and then sending it back to the sender with a note?   
A word with your friendly local post office otherwise might work. Although if the address is correct I guess they're obliged to deliver it.

			If you call at your local catholic church there should be information on where you can contact the Priest. 
He will most probably enquire if you want to take classes for maybe Confirmaton or Holy Communion and put you in touch with someone at the church who will give you classes or he might do them himself with others.

Takes 2.5h and 2 train-changes. 
As such, it's not a sane idea.

Commuted every day. Even on-call some weekends.

			Hi All, 
Does anyone know if Pro Innenstadt vouchers can be deposited in a bank? I have a bunch dont know what to do with them and would love to have cash instead-- 
I checked up the list and it says Basler Kantonal bank accepts them--(ofcourse I can go check with the bank, but just wondering if anyone has tried it?) 
Thanks!

			I know the Bhf Apotheke carries the Held washing detergent, I saw it there. But, probably other places carry it as well. Some brands make products with perfume, yet have an identical product without the perfume (like Louis Widmer). And lines like Eucerin and Eubos and Roche Posay were developed especially for people with allergies and problem with sensitivities.   
You could also try the Reformhaus at the Loeb-corner.

			Hello everyone,   
As explains in my profile, I am a student studying sustainable development and have a keen interest in greener and more sustainable ways of living. I am currently seeking any information on places with in Switzerland that can help broaden my knowledge of sustainable techniques used here. This can be anything from specially designed energy efficient buildings through to local initiatives including recycling, co-op and community based farming, transportation efficiency versus individual travel etc, etc.   
Maybe you just want to have a chat with a like minded person...please be in touch either way any information would be greatly appreciated.   
Thank you

			Hi everyone,    
I'm studying coaching psychology at masters level, and for my latest coaching logbook submission I'm looking for volunteers to work with on a quite specific area.  Essentially, I'm wanting to work through some contemporary leadership models with a few leaders and look at whether this can help them improve their leadership ability, in whatever field that may be e.g. work, volunteer activities, sport, education etc.  If that might be interesting for you, or someone you know, please drop me a PM.  I've quite a bit of knowledge and experience in the coaching/psychology/leadership area.  Would be much appreciated and help me keep my studies moving!   
Cheers John

			Shorrick is right, you either pass (4 to 6) or fail (below 4) and if you pass you have your Batchelors and that's it. To get on a Masters course you would probably have to do a bit more than just scrape through (depending on subject). Nowadays one generally needs some kind of post-Batchelors qualification eg Masters or other and in the future that is probably more likely to be the case. From my experience people here (including the cantonal authorities) don't make a difference between where you have studied, so your Oxbridge degree doesn't impress them any more than your degree from any other UK university and your grade doesn't seem to make any difference either. I suppose this could change in the future.

There are a lot of businesses in residential apartment blocks - how do you know its a private apartment by looking at google?   you dont its just what you assume.    
there is a facial/massage etc boutique in the apartment below me, and its purely a business but located in a residential block.   
if you are so concerned go with someone, or look for a website etc - cant be that hard surely?

			The French newspapers of Switzerland have a site    Someone from Basel wouldn't necessarily be posted in these papers unless they had family somewhere in the French part, but it doesn't hurt to do a name search (it is free and goes back to when the site started sometime in 2008).     
I don't know if there is a German equivalent? Anyone?  I found a couple for local papers on google...not sure how reliable or how far they go back or if they are as user friendly as hommages...              - This is Basel but it requires registration, apparently

			I don't know the Lorraine area that well but I can give you some information.       is not very far from the Lorraine. There are indoor and outdoor pools. In the summer the outdoor pools are free and very pleasant. In the summer there is also the Lorrainebad by the side of the Aare, or the Aare itself for swimming.    
There is an Indian grocery store, Aggarwal, in the Schwanengasse near the main train station.    
As I say I haven't spent that much time in the Lorraine but as a woman in my thirties I wouldn't think twice about going anywhere in Bern around 8-9pm. (Maybe someone will jump in and tell me where I can be murdered at that hour.)     
Zurich is not very far from Bern. Why not come visit and check things out?

			I'd like to learn the stuff myself, even if others will normally do it. I prefer the flexibility of knowing since queries can and do change over time.   
So I'll learn online as some of you suggested and maybe get a course in the UK afterwards.   
Thanks for all the suggestions!

			If you have a Manor where you are, you can get Hagerty silver and Hagerty brass polish, or something called Twinkle for silver and for brass and copper, which is just as good. 
It's on the floor where the ironing-board covers and vacuum cleaner bags etc. are.   Probably the top floor. 
Oh and they do a good wax polish there too.

			Hi Faye,   
I'm not in Zurich but I might be able to help you. (The Swiss postal system is fabulous; and my husband and I are planning a trip to Zurich in a couple of weeks if you wanted to meet personally). I do letterpress work on 100% cotton papers and gorgeously thick card stock using an Adana 8x5 hand press. I have a photo polymer platemaker so I'm not limited to using metal type and now can also do die cuts/ small packaging runs etc.   
My blog has some of my work up ( ) and I've a website but Carlos R has already linked to it.

Hope I'm posting in the right place, and right title! Last year, so many helped me in trying to find my mother's employment details - thanks again to so many. I am trying to find the ownership of a hotel in Bern called the Hotel Kreuz but I want to know if a family called Steiner owned it in the 1950s, particularly 1955. Can anyone help me by either knowing the local history or the official office I should be asking? Many thanks. Btw I'm in UK. 
I'm particuarly interested in an Adrian Steiner who was there in 1955.

			A foreign certificate from a Doctor unable to examine you NOW and give a current view of your condition will not be acceptable. If you have a long-term illness, you should be followed here in CH if it is serious, and therefore your doctor here in CH should be able to give a valid and current cert. A Swiss doctor who examines you and finds you genuinely too sick to take the exam will of course give you (well, you will have to pay) a certificate, but only in his professional judgement.

			The one I'm using to type this has been pretty good for me, if it's any help. 
It's an Acer Aspire One D150 - There's a few different specs available, but mine is: 
Intel Atom N280 Processor 
1Gb RAM 
160Gb HDD 
Wi-Fi 
Bluetooth 
Builtin 3G MODEM 
10 inch Screen 
Builtin Webcam   
And it's blue too!    
It cost 799CHF, and I use it with a mobile broadband subscription from Orange. So I can browse the net anywhere, which is really handy for checking EF of course.    
As for performance, it's really good - not super fast, but I installed Windows 7 and Office 2007 on mine (instead of Windows XP that it came with), and it runs just fine. I always have it connected to either Wi-Fi or 3G when it's on, and I get about 5-6 hours battery life. Which translates for me to about 2-3 days between charges.   
Mine came from Interdiscount in Marktplatz Basel, and they had cheaper versions without the 3G, but also with smaller batteries.

			hi,   
I have a BSc degree from another non-EU country and a Nachdiplom from ETH in Software Engineering, my GPA in this one was 5.6 out of 6   
I've been working in industry in CH for more 9 years always in IT and finance. Currently, I am working 100% and doing a MSc at ETH at the same time ... I chose a math specialization track. The courses of this track are very tough and driving me really hard so this is reflected in my marks badly ... I am passing but e.g. 4.5    
My questions are: I am just afraid the lower GPA becomes counter-productive even when this is a MSc from ETH in one tough core subject e.g. in the whole MSc program we are only a handful of students taking that math path.   
Thanks in advance, 
Regards, 
TapiroLee

			Welcome to the Forum.   
The place where you are living in Switzerland on 31st December, receives your tax for that year, ie 2011.    
I think (or believe) that on 31st December 2012 the tax system will recognise your wife, and your tax will be corrected.    
Most married people pay more tax, and some even divorce for tax reasons, so maybe you need to find out a bit more about your personal allowances.

I find this extremely disillusioned. Is anyone perfect? If you find the perfect person, will they accept you if you're not perfect (because if you are perfect, you wouldn't have any problems finding the perfect mate).   
Sure there's nothing wrong about persuing perfection or having high standards, but it kinda nullifies your deservced right to complain that you're not finding anyone after a year.

			To the OP, have you thought to google?    
There are pentecostal churches - one in Geneva       
Or these, for charismatic...     
Of course the only two listed are in Basel Land and Lausanne   
But you might contact any of these places and see if what sort of network exists... plus the other resources people have given you in Bern. I imagine that the people participating in these congregations have a better handle on what you're looking for.    
Spiez is a great choice - near to Inerlaken and very pretty. Anything in Bern is about an hour's drive, and easily accessible via public transport.    
Good luck....You'd probably get a more thoughtful response if you posted an intro about yourself, when you're coming and so forth...

			Yes, an official copy from your bank in Africa that shows how much savings you have. When you apply for apartments and tell them that you are a student, they will raise an eyebrow and look at you suspiciously or be direct and ask you how you plan to pay. When you submit an application, you will have an official document that proves you are a potential tenant with the means to pay your way. It helps. Universities recommend you budget at least 20,000CHF per year, so it helps to show you are aware of this and are capable of paying this.   
Okay, fall and winter: you need clothing to keep you warm enough in up to -10 or -15 degrees celsius. So: 
-long pants, jeans 
-sweaters, fleece jackets or hoodies 
-shoes that close, boots don't hurt 
-warm socks that cover your ankles 
-mitts/gloves, a bonnet/toque, or scarf 
-a good jacket that blocks wind, and or rain, and provides you some insulation   
You can get all these things here as you need them, but it's an expensive place to go shopping.

crisps (anything except plain or paprika, we have those), marmite, bovril, powdered mustard, mushroom sauce, mint sauce, good tea bags, Paxo stuffing,   
3 pint pie dish, 4 pint basin, birthday cards, pastry cutters, nappies (Expensive here)!   
for the first few months & until you have rewired all your appliances, some UK multi strip power extension sockets (With about 2 foot of cable), maybe one for each room.

I studied in Lausanne, and I would never trade it for any other place (I actually did an exchange at st. gallen and can't say I was happy with that, though it might have helped me in searching for jobs in CH).    
Lausanne is warm, absolutely beautifuly, exciting, with a very large student population, and a lot more fun things to do than in Geneva. Geneva is highly international (too international if you want to get a glimpse of Switzerland) and it defintiely caters more to the business/UN crowd than to students. Nonetheless, the university there is very good, in particular if you'd like to focus on international studies.   
In any case, the two cities are about 45 min apart by train    
Good luck!

			In addition to previous info regarding driving license conversion in SZ   
Last week I got my license.  
And found out that they NOW   
Input whether it is for Automatic or Manual. 
If you see number 78 at the back of your license, you are only allowed to drive automatic.    
78 - Nur Fahrzeuge mit Automatikgetriebe.   
With my original license, I was allowed to drive Motorbike regardless cc. 
I didn't know I was allowed to drive a big bike though.   Had experience of driving scooter only.   
Anyhow when I applied I ticked everything I allowed. Small n big motobike, car with trailer n even tractor. Wishing they give me a license that allow to drive scooter n car at least.   
Appearently with my Switzeland driving license, I am allowed to drive motorbike(without limit to the size) n car only. Exactly what I wanted at the first place.     
Btw     
If you see 25kW or 45km/h, you are only allowed to drive a motorbike   
25kW - Motorräder bis 25 kW und bis 0.16 kW/kg 
45km/h - Motorräder mit aug 45 km/h beschränkter Geschwindigkeit     
There are also these following number can be found on your driving license if applicable,     
70 ( ) - Umtausch ausländerischer Führerausweise(Ausweisnummer und Landeszeichen in Klammern) 
101 - Besondere Auflage 
106 - Kleinbusse mit mehr als 17 Plätzen im Binnenverkehr für nichtberufmässige Personentransporte 
109 - Wohnmotorwagen und Feuerwehrmotorwagen mit mehr als 7.5t

			Just tell him that if he has the clippers, they are calibrated in mm and not in some number scale as I am told they are in the UK.      
I know this because a few weeks ago I was in our (French speaking) hairdressers here in Liestal and a British man came in asking (in loudest English so that Johnny Foreigner could understand) for a number 2 cut.  The hairdressers were most perturbed so I assisted by translating for them that a ""number 2"" would mean his head was practically shaved.  It was not at all what he wanted.  Apparently a number 2 in the UK is closer to a cm in length .. not that I would have any idea as the clippers have never ever come near my head.   
But was tempted for a few seconds there not to intervene ...

			HELP, please? I am going crazy trying to find 2 kids' (girls) twin beds that are stable, classic-design and mid-range price. I have looked (ad nauseam) at all of the biggies (Micasa, Ikea, Fly, TopTip, etc.) but it seems everything is either 150CHF (rickety) or 800+CHF (tree-house style). Is there a happy in-between that both looks good and will last through their childhood/adolescence?   
Recommendations on where to buy good quality bedding (duvets and pillows, specifically)? Seems so silly to transport this stuff from America but at least I know where I can find good quality and good prices.    
I know it is here, I just need help finding it. I have checked and researched previous info posted on the EF but it dates from ~2007 (I am hopeful that there is something new on the market).

 Problem here is that coffee beans are half grinded. Coaresness is already at minimum and gridning can not be adjusted further.

As of 16.01 Aldi has a special offer on a   of Sony AA and AAA batteries for CHF 5.99. The price is the same for both sizes.

			Just been made aware of a great project,  , seems to be a high tech workshop anyone can come along and use to develop projects, giving you access to materials, tools and some fancy modelling stuff by the looks of things.  They have one in Luzern.   
The Fablabs charter from the site.      Does anyone know more about them?  Used them? Do similar projects exist?   
I'd like to use it but their opening times are a thorough pain, 1pm-5pm, 3 days a week, still, it's come at a perfect time, might be worth an afternoon off.

If you actually want to do some landscaping (i.e. adding hills and valleys to your garden, not just flowerbeds) than keep in mind that you REALLY should get your stuff compacted too, not just shovelled and left there. Otherwise you'll have the whole thing sliding or collapsing over time. Again, not so hard to do but you need one of those heavy, noisy machines...

Something else that was thrown into the mix is that when it was built the area around Zurich was celebrating 100years since the battles with Napolean. A number of areas around Zurich have benches, lookouts etc built around this time. A time to move on etc.   
However, none of that explains why it is called Elefantenbach - years before the statue arrived.

He only uses the space provided (floor fee) and teaches privates only.  I am not recommending any studio in Oerlikon, just the teacher.

The one on the left is sort of fine but be careful:   
The German ones with the thick pins are called Schucko. 
They look like 2 pin but are actually three because the earth contact is carried on the outside. That's why the whole plug fits into a round recess.    
You should thus not fit them into flat adapters.   
Get a German Schucko to Swiss three-pin adapter instead. You can get them in hardware stores.   
The one on your picture is missing the outside metal strip, so I guess it's fine. But if the plug has that strip, use the proper adapter.   
Here is a German Schucko plug, note the metal strip on top. That's the earth contact instead of a third pin.

It certainly fits the symptom. The bit storing the data is the same regardless of whether the HD is internal or external. A new caddy, will simply involving removing the HD from its casing, and then plugging it into the new one.  It's very simple.

I hope somebody can help... I am looking for some custom size/made frames. I saw an old thread on here recommending Migros and Coop as well as Ikea but I have so far drawn a blank there.   
I googled in the UK and there seems to be loads of online distributors (EFrame, EZEFrame etc.) where you enter custom measurements and choose a design and don't pay very much. Haven't had much luck in finding such a service in Switzerland.   
Does anyone have any tips?   
Thanks!

A client who was in the midst of moving left keys in one of Ikea's mobility vans they hired on a Friday night. On the Saturday morning they realised the set was missing and they called me. I managed to reach someone at Ikea on the van rental desk, they checked the paperwork and located the van that had been rented, and searched for the keys. They for them and I was able to pick them up at the customer service desk that morning.   
Now   is service.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Oct 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	ikea phone number	Rachael85	Posts: 38

			thanks all. we eventually went to the permanence clinic and paid 200 chf for everything (consultation, tests and the meds). she is feeling better now, not sure if it is because of the medicine or that the virus are just going away by itself though. but at least she has no problem talking/swallowing now. and let's just hope that she could claim all that money back.

			Today i received my car and got hit on the bumper so the start didn't go so well but i was wondering about the prices of bumpers and would it be advised to go to the Opel company or i'm better off with a garage nearby. Living in Geneve, if you know address to an Opel garage with reasonable prices/labor then let me know   
Thanks.

			I don't know if this is what you want but there is a huge second hand book store in Basel (according to the website there are in Aarau, Bern, Luzern, Zuerich, too). Many are in German but there is an English book section. All paperbacks are 1.50 CHF.

Not to say the French were not tired of war, which had been going on literally since 1792 non-stop against several nations at once with England holding the sea, pulling strings and financing mostly.  No one can accuse the French of surrendering easily until 1940, when the armiy was mostly run by closet fascists and the soldiers were sent out without proper boots or ammo to literally lose a battle (See Alistair Horne's brilliant work on the subject)...

			Hey!   
I had a similar situation but deciding between UNIGE and UNIL. I just moved to Switzerland from the USA and am now doing my Masters at UNIL.    
You are right about UNIL, a lot of people speak french but as well as a lot of other languages. All of my courses are in French but I can still speak English if I want. They also provide free language courses with a lot of different options.    
I haven't visited UNINE so I am a bit biased, but UNIL has a lot of facilities and organisations which I love. The campus is really nice too. Plus you are already one step ahead since you already live in Lausanne. They also have lot of different lectures that you can attended and resources for post-graduation.    
Exam wise, it really depends on your courses. Most of my exams will be this January/February, but it depends if you are taking a seminar or lecture class. Some courses have exams during the year, like a mid-term and then final. The seminar classes you normally have a project or papers throughout the year then you continue the class all year long and sometimes have an exam at the very end. Also some exams are written and others are oral. Basically it depends on your section and courses.    
Hope that helps!

I'm not sure what year this was introduced but I do know that now it is the way things are because I have seen with my own eyes !

			Maybe you should cancel your skiing?   
After 4 pm on Saturday the 24th, the normal stores will be closed until Tuesday 27th.    
Again at New Year the stores will be closed from 4 pm Saturday 31st until Tuesday 3rd. There might be slight regional lateness.    
Outside these times you would have to go to a main railway station and buy groceries there, in a supermarket that opens later every day.

			Hi there,  
Jumbo has moving boxes, but it is hard to find the small ones. I am not aware that IKEA carries them, but they may have storing boxes that will work (but may be a bit more expensive...). 
There are Jumbo shops everywhere, there is a big one in Morges area.

			For Lutefisk, you'll probably have to   from salt or (preferably) dried cod, though personally I find it a waste of good dried or salt cod!   
""The first treatment is to soak the stockfish in cold water for five  to six days (with the water changed daily). The saturated stockfish is  then soaked in an unchanged solution of cold water and lye for an  additional two days. The fish swells during this soaking, and its   content decreases by more than 50 percent producing a  -like consistency. When this treatment is finished, the fish (saturated with lye) has a   value of 11–12 and is therefore  .  To make the fish edible, a final treatment of yet another four to six  days of soaking in cold water (also changed daily) is needed.  Eventually, the lutefisk is ready to be cooked.  ""   
Yummm!

			We were talking at the Pot Belly's Christmas Roast Buffet; which was fabulous btw - really good gammon and the roasties are getting even better not to mention the roast parsnips...and then christmas pud and custard but I digress.    
Anyway the question about bringing back Christmas Crackers from the UK came up. So I checked the BA website (I am flying with them) and found out that:   
 Christmas crackers cannot be taken in your hand baggage. They must be carried in your checked baggage only. 
In addition the following restrictions apply: Some airports may have further restrictions on crackers. Please check with the airport before you travel. you can have up to 2 boxes per person in checked luggage EXCEPT if flying through London City airport   
Relevant web page is below........       
Just checked the Easyjey web site and they say you can bring up to 2 boxes in original packaging as hand luggage BUT London Gatwick and Standsted say they have to be in your checked luggage     
Couldn't find anything on Swiss web sites...someone else might know.   
So if you have anyone coming over for Christmas you can still have them, and if you are hosting a post December Christmas meal (that will be me) then I will be buying them in the sale and bringing them back....did I mention I am Scottish!!

Or I think you should send it to Tom to see if he can fix it for you. That's what I'm going to when my stuff breaks.

			Hello there!  
I have been reading threads on this forum for some time, and although I have read many threads on ETH and EPFL, most of them are related to Master's degrees or people that want to apply to a Bachelor degree from another university, so hopefully this will be different.   
I have already read the Application/Admission page of the ETH and basically know what I need:   
- CV/résumé -table form 
-Photocopies of matriculation certificate (High school diploma, etc.) In my case, ICFES, as I'm from Colombia  
-Application fee 
-Admission test   
By the way, I want to study architecture... and I'm aware of the costs of living in Zurich, but this   be a problem.   
Well, I have no problems with the photocopies or the Application and exam fee, but I'm most worried about the Aufnahmeprüfung and the résumé... 
Seriously, what am I supposed to write on my résumé? I'm only 15 years old, and, well, I have basically studied in just one school my entire life, so It'll look pretty empty...   
I already know some German, so that shouldn't be a problem and I'm planning to take the ''C2: Großes deutsches Sprachdiplom'' at the Goethe-Institut next year, so there's plenty of time to study...  
I'm  fluent in English and I speak French, Portuguese and have some knowledge of Japanese, maybe this isn't important at all but, well, it may help... (I'm aware that ETH doesn't take this into account)    
As  I told you later, I'm quite concerned about the entrance examination, as I've read that it's very (if not extremely) difficult to pass it -actually the EPFL ''strongly discourages students from taking the exam merely with the knowledge they acquired at their school'' but I actually think it's quite exaggerated- I still have one year to go, as I'm on 10th grade and the Colombian secondary system just goes till the 11th grade, so I'm not in a hurry...  
The financial issues aren't   important, so my main concern is to pass the exam...   
They also say it's impossible to start studying the same year you present the exam, but maybe it is possible for me to enter the country with a Schengen visa issued by another country to  , and have enough time for my student visa to go through, as it takes three months (!) to process... but actually this seems very unrealistic...   
I still have one question, does the ETH calls   student that applies to take the exam or they basically select those with the most impressive résumés and the ones with the best grades? If it is so, can I take the Umfassende Aufnahmeprüfung so I have more chance? I know it sounds quite naive, but, who knows? 
My grades aren't bad, but they aren't perfect either. I've lost some subjects throughout my scholar life but I've been on the top 3 of my class every year. My average score is 8.7/10... (last two years)   
Finally, do you think it's better to apply to ETH or to EPFL, maybe Lausanne its a little bit cheaper... Or do you think I should instead apply to another university...I have also thought about RWTH Aachen in Germany and TU Delft in the Netherlands, so I have considered a lot of options...   
Just to organise the aforementioned ideas, I write my precise questions:   
1) What am  I supposed to write on my résumé? 
2) Does ETH call every student that applies, or they base their decision on my grades/résumé? 
3) Is it better to apply to ETH or EPFL? 
4) Is it better to apply to a different university in another country? 
5) Do you think that the exam is   difficult? 
6) ETH says you'll need about 1500 CHF to live comfortably, is this realistic?   
Thank you very much indeed!

			Hi, I'm going to be doing a Certificate in Primary Education and later on an MA in Education with the College of New Jersey, which gives you a US state qualification if you have American citizenship. The international school where I work accepts it. You can do some courses online and two or three summers in Majorca, which for me is ideal. Plus you will need a practice teaching in a primary school over 13 weeks.

			Hello,    
I have been very excited about the idea of having garden space close to my apartment in Riehen. I looked on the official website ( ) and it seemed all was well.   
The restrictions didn't seem to be an issue... until I called. It seems that a B-Permit is on the ""nope, you cannot have a garden"" list.    
The woman I spoke with suggested finding a Swiss national to get the garden for me, but I don't want to get involved with that.   
Does anyone know of a place where I can find sublets for gardens, or of maybe private owners who rent garden space?   
I am new to Basel (moved at the end of October) and know very little about a  lot :|   
Any help is greatly appreciated!!   
Best Regards 
Dave

			If you're heading to the Salvation Army near Bhf. Hardbrücke anyway, check out Bogen 33 right next to it:   and right next to that:  
Plus: If you like USM, there is a secondhand USM dealer on Quellenstrasse, it's just a 10 minute walk from Hardbrücke:  
still expensive, but never as much as the new stuff.

			Also bear in mind that just because a catalogue claims the value is a certain amount or an expert tells you, that is no guarantee that you will actually get that amount. But of course it is a good strating point if you just want to know the value for insurance purposes or similar. Coins and stamps are not commodities and a certain degree of luck is involved in both buying and selling, as in is there somebody looking for precisely that item at the precise time you are selling. I've watched items on Ebay and have seen an item sold for 200CHF one week, and an identical item the next week being offered for 40 and not getting a single bid.

			Switzerland is a pretty big place. Do you have an idea about the city/area you want to organize this project in?   
Once you have a city, just contact some churches, organize your musicians, and give your concert.  
or. 
Organize your choir (do you have any contacts with choir directors here?), use their home church, and organize your orchestra.   
There are a few professional choirs around, or you could arrange to ""borrow"" an amateur group. There are also professional orchestras, gig orchestras, around, but it's usually cheaper to build a group piecemeal. For that you'll need someone on the ground. Send me a private message if you need any help.   
Musicians here expect a Swiss living wage, which is seldom recoverable by ticket revenue alone. If you haven't already, you should look into additional funding.

defining insider trading is a bit like defining what is sexy or obscene - the intent is as important as the content.   
1. You would be seen as having access to non-public information. However, if it was material non-public information, your employer would have warned you already and made you sign stuff to the effect. I would say that is not insider trading, but a court's verdict would depend on the jurisdiction, how much money you make off the trade, whether you tip off others, and which side of the bed the judge got off...   
2. is not insider trading. You are acting based on publicly available information.   
3. the information you have is not publicly available, but I suspect that in this case the prosecution would have to prove intent on the part of your mate to profit from such information.

			Has anyone been to it before? It takes place tomorrow and I have rented a stand there. I am new to the market scene and thought I would check out different ones at Christmas this year. Since the weather doesn't look great for tomorrow, I was wondering if it would be worth it standing out there all day in the rain. Is it one of those markets where all you find are knitted socks, candles and strange Christmas decorations and such?  
Perhaps there are a few EFers from around the Baden area that could help me out with this.

Best to check with them first.    
Whatever the fees, it's usually cheaper and more efficient to use the ATM method when traveling to Europe/Canada to get your local currency than it is to bring cash and go to the currency exchange.   
Another thing you can look into if you're the type of person who likes to actually have cash in hand before departure is  .   I used them when I lived in the US before I went on a pan-Asian vacation and they were very helpful, gave me a good rate, AND when I got back, they also bought all of my unused currency at the same rate I paid for it.  
It's worth looking into if you have the time to plan for a mail delivery of your currency.

			Actually, there are economically viable ways of recovering funds in Switzerland but you need to be able to communicate in one of the official languages of the country. If you are only trying to get back money owed, you can always file a ""Betreibung"". But again, you have to do it in German. I hardly think that a court in the US would accept a claim filed in German by someone living in Switzerland.   
As for punishing the crook, that is for the state to do, not you. If there has been a crime committed, as opposed to a simple breach of contract, then you need to contact the police.

			Hello All,   
This may be a long shot, but does anyone know the words (in German) to the song they sing at the beginning of the baby swimming class from H2O Wasser:   in Zurich?   
It starts ""Hallo, hallo..."" and then I'm lost.

			Hi All   
For my Secret Santa this year I am looking to buy a Sushi gift set but as I do not live in or around Zürich I don´t know where to find one.  Is there a website that sells these sort of things and maybe deliver?   
Thanks   
Chris

			If you are looking to do a bachelor's abroad you might want to look at this book called The New Global Student by Maya Frost. Maybe check the library before you buy it.    
I have not read it but she lived many years here in Argentina with 4 high school aged daughters. Then wrote this book about American students studying abroad without going through exchanges.   
 Anyway, she's also done some radio/podcast interviews. So have a look & see if it helps.    
Good luck.

			Or you could order a (delicious) takeaway from  . They deliver the meals in a tiffin, which you can either keep or return to them for a CHF10 refund (works like the Pfandflaschen). A lot of people keep the tiffin until their next delivery and so they always have a tiffin ""on hire"".

			You could take it to Hood's Cycles. They're just below the station on Avenue de Grancy. The owner is English and a great bloke. Because it's a small shop they can charge a lot for parts they have to order in, but for a simple gear adjustment the most he should charge is a new cable and labour so it should be fine.

Cost including delivery to Basel was £600. Import duty and TNT/Swiss Post charge this end CHF85. Very simple.

			In Zurich, if you have items, especially kitchen and furniture, there's ArcheZurich:    or  .  You will need to call and make an appointment for pick up.     
For clothes, you can use Texaid and Solitex.  I believe you receive complimentary texaid bags in the mail on a monthly basis and you can also drop off the clothes at the many recycling receptacles around the city.

			I will say from the beginning that I have never worn or bought any of the Mammut gear, and thats mainly because it just doesn't seem that great to me from outward appearance vs price.    
I'm a bit of a tech curious sort of person, always heavily researching my gear and applying strict criteria to what I buy, cos I really want my hard earned to keep on giving after its been handed over the counter. Yes, it is a Swiss brand and therefore perhpas not well known out of this area, but I very rarely come across the Mammut name in gear reviews or forums. And the other major factor is the price, it really is quite high for some of the items, and I just don't like forking out for something that I'm not sure will work. ie taking a punt on something because of the name rather than based on research. I'm quite happy to pay for quality, just want to shorten the odds on getting that quality.   
Like meloncollie I buy some of my gear from the States or at specialist shops. My other rule of thumb is that if I see it regularly on the high street then I don't bother buying it, because a company that is getting sufficient sales with the city folk is unlikely to be putting much effort into R&D and focusing on back country use. Yes I mean North Face    
There is a climbing/hiking shop in Carouge called Cactus which has reasonable range of stuff, and specialist brands like Rab or Outdoor Research, that you won't find at Ochsner or Manor

			I have the cinecard and have gotten many cheaper movie tickets. I don't remember how much I paid, I seem to remember it was around 100 CHF but I've had it for 3-4 years now so maybe the cost has changed.    
How it works is you add money to the card via your credit card, and when the balance is low you just top it up. You pay for the movie tickets online (the card is linked to your user name on   so you only need to enter the details once) and I do the print at home or go to the box office with the booking number. If you only reserve with your card you need to get the tickets at least 45 mins before the film and they will have no issue turning you away if you show up 15 mins before.   
The only downside is you can only purchase 2 tickets at the reduced price of 13 CHF, and additional would be the regular price. And not all movies are eligible for 13 CHF tickets, but I don't know why. I go to the theatre a lot so for me I find it's worth it.

			Hi, 
what we had in school was the ""English G"" series from Cornelsen. It has everything; little stories about english culture (UK & USA), grammar, exercises, jokes, vocabulary. What annoyed me was that any famous brand names were avoided, so they created stupid similar-sounding names. And they explained the difference between british and american English, which didn't help, but only confuse me... 
In general, I think these are good books.   
Don't take any books designed for the cambridge certificates FCE, CAE, CPE (unless thats the goal), because these textbooks really only focus on how to score in the exam.

Of course there is a get-what-you-pay-for rule, a £50 Seiko won't be finished as well as a £500 one.   
I mentioned Omega in the context of the discussion, not as a recommendation. So to make up for it, I'll make another recommendation to the OP. Look for Tissots on sale. A friend of mine recently acquired a very simple and elegant Tissot at Manor for CHF 150.

			Hi everybody,   
I just perused this   hoping to find some useful information for my situation but it seems to me that it only confirms I can't really do much. So, the only thing I'm going to do is to share the experience and hope that at least a few others won't repeat the same mistakes.    
1) Bought (what I thought to be) a new Receiver for my home theater. Price: roughly 500 CHF. A model from some years back with excellent reviews for its price range.   
2) The item is found through toppreis.ch. The seller, albeit seemingly small, has a reasonably high customer rating. I don't remember if I checked their return policy before or after the purchase, but it's in German and Google Translate makes a significant error suggesting that it is possible to ask a refund in case of faults. Later on my understanding of German improves and I understand that the policy explicitly expresses the opposite.   
3) The purchase occurs via a bank-to-bank transfer rather than credit card to save some money. In hindsight, this was a big mistake. Credit card purchases offer seemingly much better protection. Unfortunately, having lived in the UK a number of years and accustomed to the consumer-friendly return policies, I didn't quite realized I needed protection.   
4) The item, ordered and payed in early July, is delivered about a week later.    
5) The packaging is in somewhat worrying conditions. Outside lettering is faded and in some cases teared albeit the structural integrity of the cardboard box seems to be in place. More worrying are the heavy fracture lines in the polystyrene forms holding the receiver and normally offering some protection from impacts. Clear adhesive tape had been used to re-strengthen the fractured forms.  
5a) given the packaging condition, I wonder if the item is actually new. Thinking about this issue I realize that the seller's website had no information on the condition of the item, i.e. new or used. No idea then if I can assume the item was sold as new or if anything goes. 
5b) later on I speculate, even to the seller, that the item might have been subjected to a serious drop. I.e. from somebody's hands or from a truck's platform.   
6) 24-48 hours after delivery I get around disconnecting my existing receiver and plugging in the newly purchased one. To my disappointment the front-left output channel generates a considerable amount of noise/interference. I execute various tests such as swapping cables and loudspeakers to exclude faults of my own equipment and everything seems to confirm a problem with the new receiver. I eventually reconnect my old receiver and as everything goes back to normal I conclude that the new receiver is faulty.  
6a) During testing I also notice some sporadic, audio artefacts while listening to music from a PC connected via HDMI. At this stage the ""drop"" hypothesis forms in my head and points to systemic problems that I judge unlikely to be solved through a simple repair.    
7) I inform the seller of the fault the next working day and I'm told, rather than send back the item at my own expenses as I understood from their return policy, to annex a letter detailing the problems observed and hold it to be picked up by a courier. The seller also mention that the courier would get in touch with me to decide on a time and day for the pickup.    
8) Things get a little fuzzy here in terms of timeline but after two months of phone calls and emails with the seller, after a failed pick up (the courier had not called to set a date and time), after the courier is found to have lost the information associated with their own pick up reference number (they even left a note asking to call them quoting that number) I'm told by the courier I need to contact again the seller which in turn has to organize another pick up. This time the seller seems to be a little more solicit recognizing that two months to return an item is a little too much. With a few more hiccups/phone calls the pick up finally occurs.    
9) Both in the letter annexed to the receiver and via email I make it very explicit that as I suspect systemic problems I'd rather have a full refund instead of a repair addressing one issue but leaving more sporadic and even more annoying problems in place.    
10) At this point it should be noted that throughout this period and the following two months up to now the seller responds to my emails with one-liners never really committing to anything: not to a refund nor to specific dates, always ending with ""we'll let you know"", but never saying when nor what's happening.    
11) Now, another two months have gone by since the pick up and I've just been told (after my latest email) that the repair center is in Germany (which is why it's taking so long) and that it -might- take another two weeks. And this is where we stand as of yesterday.   
Unfortunately, I feel like I have the law against me as I understand that the federal law can be overridden by specific seller policies and as the purchase didn't occur via credit card. The one thing that I wonder if it would be on my side is the time that is occurring for the whole process. Four months (and counting - including pickup time) to repair a receiver? It seems vaguely unreasonable. Isn't there a limit on how long this kind of things can take? In hindsight it would have been useful to agree with the seller to a deadline for the repair -before- the item was picked up by the courier. Assuming that the seller would have agreed to a deadline at all. I mean: why should they have to?    
Perhaps a consumer association or legal advice might help, at least to make sure that there are no further delays. But legal advice sounds prohibitively expensive for a 500 CHF item and a consumer association such as ktipp.ch might not provide useful advice to people with only rudimentary understanding of German (I might investigate on this front).    
Ultimately what annoys me the most is that my utterly negative experience with this seller (and the toppreis.ch rating I will be eventually assign to it) will be swamped by the positive ratings of those that were lucky enough to purchase faultless items (excluding sinister possibilities such as the seller having hired people through   to artificially inject hundreds of false positive ratings) and the seller will be therefore allowed to go on without having to change a single thing in their processes.    
But I've certainly learned my lesson: pay via credit card and stick to well known, larger shops even if their goods cost more.    
Comments and feedback are welcome.   
Sincerely,   
Manu

			My eldest uncle was born on 11/11/11. If he was still alive, he would be 100 today. Unfortunately he died before I was born - a NZer RAF pilot, killed during WW2. I, my  siblings and cousins all grew up with his photograph being on prominent  display in our houses, so we all sort of felt we ""knew"" him.  Being the 100 year anniversary of his birth, another 11/11/11  and it being Rememberance/Memorial Day, has made me feel more reflective than usual.

			Hi to everyone.  
I wanted to share some information on teeny tiny shop in Nyon, Bric-a-brac. 
I was sent there for ""stage"" during 4-week coaching program of Genevan unemployment office, and there is plenty of stuff there, from vintage furniture to (my favorite part) vintage porcelaine. Last time I even found old Polaroids and these videocams from 70-s, it is probably very good that I don't have too much space in my rented apartment. 
They also can pick up your old stuff if you leave nearby.  
And the biggest thing for me, they collaborate with Association Pro-Jet, which is created for adaptation of young people to Swiss job market.    
That's their website:   .

Just wanted to send a quick note to say thanks for all your help on scooter shopping - we found exactly what we were looking for at the Migros above. And they were such fun that we got one each for the kids, and one for us to share too.    
Getting the scooters turned out to be very beneficial for our school visit too, as the kids' future school had a big pile of them in the cloakroom and all my son can think about now is that he'll be able to scooter to school like the other kids!   
(We found a place to live in Préverenges, BTW, so hopefully I'll be seeing some of the Lausanne-based members at forum socials soon.)   
Thanks again

			Germany has two chain department stores.  Karstadt and Galleria Kaufhof.  The latter is usually a bit cheaper, but otherwise they're virtually identical.  They do homewares.  Service isn't quite up to JL's level, and the prices are cheaper than here (Switzerland) but not as low as the UK.

			Hi Jamie,   
This site is oriented more towards the French part of Switzerland, but still might be of interest to you.    
They have lots of events listed for Lausanne, Geneva and Bern, so hopefully you'll be able to find something that suits you. I know it's not expat-oriented, but it's the best I can do.   
Good luck!

Carol's Second Hand Mode 
Kreuzbühlstrasse 1

There is also this shop.     
They accept used articles on consignment. Here is an explanation of the conditions.     
You could also advertise here though I understand some are reluctant to advertise used clothing for privacy reasons (you have to disclose the size of what you are selling ).

			Should all be good done that way even if it differs from our system.  We tend to split by lights versus sockets and Swiss by zones such as rooms.     
You won't need the light on for the socketss to work and diagonal chasing is OK as long as they are using a conduit (piping) of the wiring.  I prefer and ask for vertical chasing and going along walls at skirting level.  Its more work but also more predictable for later if you need to drill the wall

			well, looks like going home for xmas is too expensive (2,500chf to get the fam home). Thought maybe it would be nice to rent a chalet with a view somewhere in switzerland for a couple nights or a week. I know, I know, it is late already, i'm sure swiss ppl rented these out last year already etc etc.   
But all that aside, got a good tip for a chalet to rent? Not a run-down crap one... I have a wife & a 7-month-old, so light walking around a town is probably the most we will get up to... (read, doesn't need to be near a ski area etc, just pretty surroundings etc)

Still, good value and as they ship one book at a time, no customs costs or hold-ups.

Got away with it once, but the Italian guy told me ""never again"".  I had EUR 4k of motorcycle parts, which they didn't believe, so had to show them each and every piece of mainly carbon-fiber bodywork to compare against the invoice.  The Swiss of course had no problem, and were happy to take my money!

Probably either store could point you in the direction of teachers, since the teachers themselves shop there and/or advertise there.

Living in Nyon, in a block with 6 apartments, where our washing machine in the basement which is shared is constantly broken, the regie is crap and wont sort it with a new one....   
So is there anyone in Nyon who would be willing to 'let' their washing machine once a week ! Desperate times and all that!   
We arent allowed a washing machine in the apartment as the landlord is worried it would damages the flat!   
Looking for advice where possible on what to do, is there any laundrettes locally, or could someone recommend a cleaner locally who washes clothes...its a joke really but I am running out of boxers!

When we mentioned that we saw a similar pair for less at the Dosenbach several stores down the Limmatquai, the salesclerk not only matched the price, she beat it by 10 CHF!  Both clerks were very helpful, polite, and spoke German, fluent English, and at least one spoke some Italian.  I'd definitely shop there again.

It brings together nineteen tales of simple folks from the hidden Kingdom of Bhutan. Pem Namgyal provides glimpses of little Bhutan, a country that has been secluded from the rest of the world for centuries. The little kingdom made headlines recently for its transition to democracy when the fourth king voluntarily gave the power to people.

			Hi Everyone,   
Firstly, apologies if this is not the right place on this forum to post this as I have looked and not found an exact place to post this, so please bare with me..   
I am a self-employed businessman from London. I have my own online business [selling stock across the globe from my website and via the ebay uk portal].   
Business is running fine and making money.   
As this is an online business, I know the rules and facts of living as a self-employed person here in London, what I need to pay, how it works etc.   
The question I have is, transferring what I have here and coming over to Switzerland. My fiancee has a contract in Switzerland which is for a few years and she is going to be based there. I can run my business from anywhere in the world. The stock that I have doesn't require much space and as I import it from other countries, it can be arranged to import it into Switzerland instead of London. What are the complications with this? If any?   
How strict are the authorities for importing? Reselling? Postage for parcels across Europe and ROW?   
I know I am asking for a lot of information here but after extensive research myself, all the answers are not as clear. I have a fair idea but from people living the same kind of life in Switzerland, hearing a view from first hand would be apprecaited.   
A few facts to consider for myself: 
Turnover currently in the region of £60k a year. 
Have a Limited Company Registered here in UK. 
Business Bank Accounts in UK. 
As my business is run from a standalone website as well as ebay, 40% of earnings are made through ebay uk, with paypal all registered here in UK linked to my business accounts.   
Any help is appreciated. If you need any further info then please ask.

			In most countries, there is provision to issue fines to both owner and driver if they are two different people for vehicle compliance offences.    
What I find a bit stupid is, that in most countries these are on-the-spot fines...you know the amount at the time and you have usually about 1 month to pay. In Switzerland, so many fines require court processing...and this seems to be a big cash cow for the local and cantonal administrations.

			Dear All,    
I have recently moved from London and am looking for a decent salon doing facial hair threading in Zurich.   
I have come to know about finemore.ch but the rates are atrocious. She charges 95CHF for full face (in London I paid between 10 to 20 pounds).   
Another place   but that place is more of a barber shop than a salon.    
Am looking for a decent place that is good value for money.   
Any help will be appreciated.

Maybe they would let you use the rooms.  nearest station is Salina Raurica or Kaiseraugst, which are a 10mins train journey from Basel SBB.  Powerstation is 10mins walk from the train station.

			Hi guys,   
I am a PhD student in Zurich. I play the electric guitar and I am looking for a band to play with or other people interested in forming a band...with the only goal of having fun and, if things go well, trying to perform in clubs. 
I am not a great musician but I have been playing for a while and I thing to be good enough to have fun   I used to play rock covers. 
If you are interested in forming a band or you need a guitar player please let me know.   
Cheers 
Cristiano

Not buying a ticket was actually was a somewhat honest mistake, but you didn't really care to ask, did you? The circumstances of last night were so that I could barely make the tram and the next one was an hour away. I had to jump on if I wanted a ride to catch my next train home. Getting out of the ticket was perhaps a bit less honest, but I gave it a shot and it worked. Yes, I pat my own back for avoiding the fine.      No one's complaining, relax! I just wanted to hear the reasoning behind the groan. I didn't demand it, I just asked. No need to get so uppity.      Well, that's going off on a tangent if I've ever seen one. First off, you assume I'm a big boy. How did you know?! Second, nowhere did I state that I do this all the time. I do do it often, but you just assumed that. I don't get off by seeing how often I can do it, I'm financially constrained and see a gap where I can save myself some money, so I take the risk. In this case, I was able to escape but I do not suspect this will always be the case. I always pay the fare for longer trips. Thirdly, no one's complaining about them not being able to speak English or French, or even expecting them to do so. And again, you dangerously assume I don't speak any German if I were to travel to Zurich (wrong). So come on then, tiny tot...

			The field in Muttenz can be a bit limited at times, I've found, just the basics - I somehow get the feeling that it's not taken too seriously. The farm just along from the Swimming pool on the main road as you go towards town has a lovely display of pumkins/decorative corn and squash, starting late September/october IIRC.  You can also get freshly pressed apple juice (yummy) and year round they have locally grown stuff.   the number 60 bus takes you to 'hallenbad' or walk from the 14 tram at Schutzenstrasse.     
There's a really good flower field out at Beim Chruz near Allschwill - excellent range and high quality of flowers but you have to drive out there.  It's very conveniently opposite the Spitzwald restaurant which has a big outdoors terrace and serves pretty traditional Swiss stuff.  the address of the restaurant is Herrenweg 130, 4123 Allschwill.

In two years in the USA I have experienced more power outages than in 55 years in Switzerland. Power surges destroyed electronic equipment worth several grand, until we installed a surge protector for the whole house. In Switzerland I gleefully keep my 'puters running even during thunderstorms. Never had a problem in decades.

Unfortunately or luckily science is not yet up to the level needed to determine such things.   
One complication is that there a lot of different dental gold alloys with different contents (other metals added).   
By the time you mix a number of different dental alloys together with some pure gold & make some attempt at extracting only the gold (for example, treating with acid) then you have no chance to determine if there was ever any dental alloy in the mix.

			The Vaio would have come with a recovery CD/DVD (or two).  And a book with instructions.  If you only have the CD then boot into it and see what happens.  If it boots normally, then click ""setup"" on the CD - it should tell you what to do (i.e. how to boot off the CD).   
If you don't have the CD then you need to re-install Windows and all the Sony drivers (which you can download off the net - the standard Windows drivers will be good enough to get you online).  So you need a friend's Windows CD/DVD.  And to boot off that.  And when asked for a licence code it will be in the book, or stuck to the bottom of the laptop.   
If what I'm writing makes no sense, take it to a repair shop or ask an IT literate friend for help!

			Well Schaffhauserstrasse is unfortunately in Zürich, not in Schaffhausen.    
There is   across the river in Feuerthalen. They seem to have ""nice"" as well as ""fancy"" dress... There must be a few more places. I grew up out there and while I never hired outfits myself, friends of mine regularly did... Before they had cars, so they cant have gone all too far!   
Tried the yellowpages or search.ch? The term you'e probably looking for is ""Fasnacht"" or ""Fasnachtsartikel"" - that seems to b e the main occasions for locals to get dressed up. Across the river the local event is called ""Hilari"" by the way, their version of Fasnacht. Try searching for that...

			Oh I missed the original post about your little baby! Congratulations!  I'm not sure on how familiar you are with babies, (I was not and was in shock for about a month after the birth of my first born) so if you're anything like I was, I hope things are getting better for all of you, if you're nothing like I was, cool bananas    
The thing I've noticed with some Swiss friends of mine who have had babies, is that when I've given them gifts, they have given me one of those birth announcement cards.  Others have invited me to pop in to see the baby too.   
Your idea is lovely and if you have the energy, go for it, from what I can tell though, a card would be just as kind.

			In addition to the other comments... For one year you'll probably have a great time in both places, i'd say the natives of Basel are a lot more easy going and the art scene is more accessible, it feels like there are also more art stuff happening (Beyeler, Schaulager, Art Basel etc) in Basel. It's also nice to be able to cycle over to France and Germany in a few minutes. Zürich has a nice lake, is more picturesque has more arthouse cinemas and nightlife. Augsburg could also be a great experience (especially if you like beer and sausages), maybe ask about that on the toytowngermany.com/ forum.

			To my knowledge, the garbage sacks can only contain trash that can be incinerated, which may include small ceramics, but not large. There is a weight limit too.   
Large pots need to be taken to your local recycling center and put in the kip for construction waste, such as masonry, bricks, etc., for which there is no charge or sticker necessary.

In the guarantee period the seller must repair or replace. He may choose to refund.

			Guys, the OP has already said she's consulted a professional and is considering a Will under English Law. 
Merrylegs, to answer your questions: 
1. The advice you got was correct. A Will under English Law doesn't have to be registered.  
2. In your Will you should have appointed Executors. You should tell the Executors where your Will is located. You should also tell someone in your family or a close friend.  
3. It's your responsibility to keep your Will in a safe place. You could lodge it with the lawyers. A lot of people do. But you could just as easily put it in a bank safety box or a safe at home or amongst your personal effects at home. If you lodge with a third party, get a receipt. 
4. It's your Executors' job to implement the wishes expressed in your Will. If you've appointed English speaking Execuotrs then your Will won't need to be translated.

I was a latchkey kid before it was even a coined term. Kids know when their parents love them whether or not mom works and, frankly, I thought the world of my mother being educated and smart and such. I was also one of those dorks who cooked dinner, did laundry and, well, didn't know what sex was until sr. year of uni...unlike the bitchy housewife's kids down the street who got knocked up jr. year of high school.... I really hate how we are guilted into staying at home as if our imprisonment has something to do with whether or not our kids turn out ok when, in fact, it has little to do with it. Love your kids, and make yourself happy by doing what makes you happy...including doing work outside the home that you love. (sorry, don't mean to start a SAHM war but...I just really hate this sort of admonishment)

			I used to be a teacher of salsa, merengue and danzon. I am originally from Mexico and have danced all my life. But now Im into finance and almost have no time to do it. 
However, as I used to do it in the states, I will go to your house and teach you and your friends. For 1,2 or 3 hours from basic to advanced. That way you dont have to feel ""embarased"". I will show you how to listen to the beat, listen to the melody (which is pretty easy) and then teach you to forget about COUNTING! and start having FUN with it! I believe that here in Zurich, people count too much and forget about what salsa is all about...having fun!!! Actually it is pretty easy.  
Let me know if you are interested. I can travel around Zurich area only. Due to work I am book almost all the time. But I have some time on wensdays. Obviously I can teach in english, french or spanish. 
A BAILAR!!!

Having a property permanently available to you, having family in the UK, still being registered with a Dr would indicate to the revenue that you have not 'left' but just away from the UK.   
UK tax is self assessment, just because they don't ask you today for the money does not mean they wont come back in 5 years with penalties & interest.    
The rules for 'leaving' may change after the budget.

My question is: will I need to learn latin in order to go to the University? Also, will I be considered as an international student regardless of the fact that I speak fluent French and have lived in Geneva for the past 6 years?   
I have considered my options thoroughly and deemed this as the best, mainly because of some money issues.

			I actually have the same problem as the OP, but with Orange instead.   
When I got an SMS ""please pay within 3 days"", I sent a Mail, I had not received a bill from them yet, and I assume, the outstanding balance is CHF XX, as the orange helpline number said. If it is not the case, please send me the correct amount (2 months ago, I had the same Issue, and the Phone Service said another amount, than the bill that arrived 1 day later). At the same time, I asked for the contracts expiry date, and the address, where I could send my cancellation letter to.   
Conveniently, the bastards ""forgot"" to answer the 2 last questions  , but at least I still have 6 months left to get that sorted.

1) Keep your nose clean for 12 years. 
2) ""Become Swiss."" 
3) Have children and wait for them to grow up. 
4) Wait another 30 years for   children to grow up. 
5) Convince said children, now fully accepted as being Swiss (well, sort of kind of Swiss anyway) to...

			In Lisbon, I was travelling on a tram with a group.  Before a stop, a man came up to someone in the group and said, ""here's your wallet"" and then got off the tram.  The pickpocket had stolen the wallet, taken out the cash and given it back to the man.   
Needless to say, the pickpocket was not reported and the man in the group now only travels with a wallet that's chained on to him.

			Sadly many of the skin whitening products sold by Asian and African shops in the UK contain dangerous products, like Mercury and other stuff, like very strong steroids. So please do not buy unless you are absolutely sure of the contents, especially for children. Some of the Mercury and steroid containing products were even used on babies.

			Gellac and Shellac are two different brands of gel polish.     
Make sure that if you find a salon that does Shellac applications that the salon does the removal correctly.  One salon filed the Shellac off my nails, I had initially thought that she knew what she was doing and was only removing the top layer to make it easier to remove before the acetone soak.  Took me about 4 months to grow out the damage.

Is very difficult to compare the cost of living by the oficial standards but it depends from your day to day life. If you take Real-estate in CH is cheaper than in UK but less speculative, but quite a number of services in CH are much more expensive than in UK although providing a higher level of quality..   
A good reference for comparison can be this website:     
Hope it helps!

			There are a couple places I pass on my way home that may or may not be of use to you. I can't remember exactly where they are but they are on the route of the 31 bus in Zurich between about Hardplatz and Sihlpost, on the left hand side when travelling in that direction. The first is a small shop that I noticed because it usually has a load of old televisions sitting outside. It looks like it sells old electrical items but I'm not sure if it's just TVs. The second looks like a more modern electronics store but I noticed the window display had a few old (collector) items mixed in with their new stock. Not sure if that is just window dressing and not for sale.   
I'm not going home that way this evening but next time I do I'll try to remember to have a better look for you.

			From experience, some good advice from my Insurer's. 
If you have any piece of jewellery or heirloom which is particularly valuable to you, emotionally or otherwise - make sure you have them valued properly, but mainly keep a photographic record- several close up shots- then a couple of photos with you wearing them. It will help in proving your case and get compensation. Many insurers will offer to have the piece copied by their own jewellers if it has particular sentimental reasons. I had excellent photos of a ring I'd inherited from my grand-ma, and when I lost it it was perfectly re-made in the Birmingham jewellery quarter.

			You already read about it: it's NO problem adapting it here.  It's quite affordable as well (especially compared to the price of grills here).      No, it's not.  Meat in CH is VERY lean, which means Swiss-taste, but not American (or as in my case South-American) taste.  But it is what it is...it's not the end of the world. You'll appreciate the variety though: some 10 different types of sausages available every day, filled with cheese, wrapped in bacon, beef, lamb, pork, chops, ostrich, horse, regular, marinated...you can do a different BBQ every weekend for months and enjoy a new taste every time.

			I just returned from a few months away and realized that I never put my winter coats away. (Wool peacoat, blazer, trenchcoat (not waterproof)....) Normally, I would take them to the dry cleaners but just found out that it's 10.80chf for a jacket and 18.90 for a coat...ouch!)   
I'm wondering if I could try to wash any of this 'gently' by hand (at least the thin blazer and trenchcoat). Is it the lining or interfacing I should be worried about? Are the care labels just being cautious? (Bought these articles of clothing in Japan where *everything* seems to be labeled dry clean only).   
Since the wool peacoat has been airing out for 6 months, maybe I can wear it for another 6 before taking it to the cleaners?

official uni web pages says you can only work 15 hours/week during term time and full time during breaks:   
""Non-Swiss students need a work permit and can work for up to 15 hours a week during the semesters; there is no limit imposed during the semester break"" (  and   )

			I would recommend to avoid shops in Switzerland 
they are very expansive and also I had at least 3 (on 4-5 occasions) bad experiences about technical knowledge on high-end bike.   
Cause Italy is just around the corner, I suggest to go and find a good dealer-mechanic there or towards Como or towards Varese and Ponte Tresa. 
You also can get double benefit... lower general price, possibility to get Italian VAT (IVA 20%) cutted and pay the Swiss VAT at the border (8%). This means an extra 12% discount.   
If I am not wrong Cinelli is a brand you can find at Cicli Ballardin in Ponte Tresa, you can try to call there ++39 0332 551875

			I know plenty of people who commute from Zurich to Basel for similar reasons and have no problems with that journey.   
If I wanted to live in another city with decent nightlife, commutable to Basel and affordable with decent amounts of space, I'd probably choose Freiburg im Breisgau.  Deutsche Bahn's equivalent of the GA is reasonably priced and what you lose on tax you may well get back on rent (especially compared to Zurich) - but it's no good for nights out in Zurich.   
Otherwise, maybe somewhere on the end of the Basel's S1 line like Stein-Säckingen - plenty of trains to both Basel and Zürich, and again the opportunity of hopping over the bridge to Germany for renting and/or shopping.

I will be spending Christmas alone this year and I don't want to be stuck in Zurich bored and by myself!     
I have searched and searched online for Christmas activities/trips, but have not found anything within my budget (about 600 CHF).

Does anyone know of travel agencies or activities aimed at single people over Christmas that I could look up?  Thanks a lot for any help.

4342	12.08.2011, 08:08	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 3 Times in 2 Posts	Location: USA - Oregon	"    I'm not a psychologist... but I have quite an in-depth experience of the mental health care here from the other side (i.e. a patient), and I think your understanding is (mainly) correct.    
I say mainly, because I have been told (by my psychiatrist) that psychologists work here   (not under any physician). So a patient goes to see a psychiatrist, and that psychiatrist may then refer that patient to see a psychologist. The psychologist then reports back to the psychiatrist with results of evaluations, discussing therapy etc. But the psychiatrist has to prescribe any medication.    
My understanding is also system works in 2 ways, depending on if the psychiatrist has a private practice or works in a psychiatric hospital (or outpatient clinic of a psychiatric hospital). With the private practice, a psychologist working under the psychiatrist may have more of a counselling role. In a psychiatric hospital environment, the psychologists do more evaluation work, and also run therapeutic groups (e.g. CBT). I personally see my psychiatrist at the local psychiatric hospital, and have also been evaluated and attended therapy groups run by psychologists there. However, when I asked about having more counselling, I was told either I could switch to a private psychiatrist's practice, and then see a psychologist as described above... or I could come and see my psychiatrist at the hospital more frequently. From that I inferred that there is a difference.    
In terms of billing, my bills from the hospital (I get copies) always have the name of the director of the hospital, the name of my psychiatrist and then the names of the other therapists (psychologist, occupational therapist...) represented on that bill... but the breakdown does not (that I can decode) list who did what treatment. But there are always the first two names.    
The other experience I had that might be useful is when one of my occupational therapists suggested I worked with someone he knew outside the hospital, not only was I told I'd have to pay for it myself, but also my psychiatrist said she wouldn't be able to work with this outside person because they were not accredited. So even if you decide to set up as a private therapist, you may find it difficult to work alongside the medical profession.    
Incidentally, my work with my psychiatrist is in English, but my work with the psychologists is all in French. It took me a long time to find an English speaking psychiatrist. I'm in Vaud.

			The 40% cheaper includes the tax back - with of course nothing to pay coming in to CH as it was 2 items with each one being below the threshold.   
Given the incredibly weak EUR right now, it'll be a bargain.   
If memory serves me correctly 389EUR less 19% tax = 319 EUR at today's rates = 343 CHF vs 585 (was 689 or so)   
I note the price on amazon.de has dropped so you may find they have been generally reduced (prices seem to be the same for all stores in any given country)

			When you are in Wales got to the local Customs office and get the correct claim forms. Take these with you when you buy the goods as I think the garage / shop have to sign / stamp the form. You might be safer with employing an import / export service.    
When leaving the UK you need to go to customs and get a stamp there.    
Now I am unsure if you need to stamp leaving and entering every EU country. It used to be necessary: you queue up at the border offices with all the truck drivers. Keep your passport with you. On entering the truckers area, directly after leaving the autobahn, you also need to collect a transit pass which enables you to cross on foot to the next country get the forms stamped, and back again to the car. Then with all the paperwork you can cross the border. Things might nowadays now be easier!    
Once you have paid the Swiss tax the UK will refund the VAT.

			I have tried to repair a Black Forest pendulum clock, about 80 years old. My problem was there were no bearings! The shafts carrying the gears were just pushed into holes in the wood. Over time the wooden frame joints had deteriorated and the front panel sagged about 2 mm. This caused strain on the shafts and the clock stopped after about 6 minutes.    
Many cheap clocks were made in this period, I suspect they are not worth very much at all.    
My advice is to take it to Freiburg and ask around there. I suspect a repair would involve dismantling the clock completely and gluing it back together using a jig to hold the parts square to each other. Quite expensive!    
Another possibility is to take it to a clock museum, and ask their opinion.

 Telefon: 056 484 88 88 
 Telefax: 056 484 88 99     
I got a big table for 50 CHF. The chairs were 13 CHF each.   
This set was exactly what I was looking for. A nice inexpensive outdoor furniture set that works just fine.   
I am posting this information because I had a hard time finding this type of outdoor furniture. At most places I would have to spend 500 to 700 CHF.

			I have bought the following, from Jumbo in the past:   
1) battery powered sensor lamp - can stand freely, or (with one screw) be wall mounted. Can be switched to permanently on - but a bit hungry for batteries; but after initial outlay of rechargeable and charger for 4x AA, is no problem.      
not exactly this, but similar     
2) battery powered, push (lamp area) activated.   
Again similar, but not same as :         
3) plug-in sensor lamp - 7W bulb - only works whilst movement is present in infra-red area, then turns off after about 30 secs.   
not exactly like this:         
4) finally - bedside lamp with energy saving low watt bulb (about 15-25W normal equivalent brightness, available).

			It happens all the times on my iMac and there is no hardware option to eject it (no hole for paper clip).   
The only reliable way to eject it is to boot the computer keeping the ""option"" key pushed, then when you have the menu to choose from where to boot push the eject key (keep it pushed). All the software methods sometimes fail if the OS is already loaded. If you try to eject before loading the OS it should work.

			You can get software for your Mac Pro so that it can run windows. What software do you need to use ? Do you need to be able to transfer files to someone else in the same software ? Or log in to something ?    
Maybe there is an equivalent software in Mac...   
What version of windows do you need ? My experience is that the various versions are notoriously uncompatible, so if it's a work or study-based solution I recommend getting the exact specifications to match what is being used for the work/study situation.

Alternatively, put on your running shoes and go for a jog with the Basel Dragons Running club at 1830 - meeting at the club rooms under the Weistenstein bridge. Stay on for the meal afterwards.   
Go to the Basel Hash house harriers on the 31st ( you don't need to be a runner to be welcomed.)   
That night, come down under the Weistenstein bridge and join the folk at the two Running Club tables to eat, be merry and watch the fireworks. I will be there and so will some other EFers.   
Come to the Curry in the Park on the 2nd, after work  ( details in the Events section)    
Go to the monthly restaurant curry the following Tuesday.    
Come to the Curry In The Park event on the 2nd after work (1830hrs)

			Will the container fit in your neighborhood. We had a problem ar both ends where the container had to be loaded and unloaded elsewhere.

			So the big Mac index shows Switzerland is expensive but it also shows we can (on average) earn it in reasonable time.   
Limiting ourselves to richer countries (say the G20) is there any place where it's   with   for a   comparison?   
Is there anything more to discuss?   
I'd also go further and look at the money you have after taxes, insurance, food, accommodation, basic travel etc: do you have more left in Switzerland than in previous places to do what you want with it? We do. 'nuff said.

			Thanks Grumpygit. This is an Aston Martin DB7 Vantage Volante (2001).  It's a beautiful car with about 20,000 miles on it.  I'd love to find some way to get it back to the condition it was in when we dropped it off in Miami.  Unfortunately it sat in a container there for three weeks in the heat and humidity.  They also leave a window down on shipped cars so they can get in through the window to drive the car out.  The absorption bags (if used at all) were obviously insufficient.  Hopefully someone out there might have some helpful ideas.  We have a friendly and helpful garage in Greppen (Pirnstil Carrosserie) that is close to our home.  I'm hoping they can help.  The AM is just a unique car.

			Hi All,   
we have a small garden with 4 beds (length per bed: 5 meter, 1 meter wide) and we have a perch in front of the house which is surrounded with plants which we had taken over from our previous tenant.   
in Sept/oct, I wish to to bed out some plants which we don't like, the roses need a new cut, etc but I wish a gardenere to do that.   
Does anyone know a good gardener (or company) in the area Zurich Leimbach or Adliswil, Thalwil, etc who does such garden works for a good price?    
The companies I have contacted have an hourly rate of around CHF 80.00.   
Any help is appreciated!

			Hi pals, thanks a lot for your replies, good news updated, I got a phone from DHL and saying that the customs had released it, and I shall receive the packet today or tomorrow.   
but you cant imagine how much efforts i had made with DHL, the express agent for customs, their general line is never ment to serve how it should be, i called 24 times, and none got through, the line even doesnt allow you  to queque.   
then i call the hotline 0848 711 711, such a cheater! it cost you like 60-80 cents per mins and   
 the man picked the phone : sorry, you should call the number at DHL agent 
I: i did, but it's never reachable , I cant talk to anybody. the only lady i spoke to doesnt speak english at all 
the man: sorry but i cant help you, if you want to complaint, you have to call that office number. 
I: how can i complaint if the line wont be put through? 
the man: ...... 
I: can you call your colleague in that office and ask someone speaks english to call me back? 
the man: no....I dont have to do that, you have to call them, I cant help you. 
I: (what the f....) only thinking, didnt say it out. look at my phone, already 15 minutes gone 
the man: Miss, we have a lot of clients waiting, i already told you i cant do anything for you, I have to pick up other calls. 
I: yes, but you need to offer me a solution to this rediculous situation. 
man: you can keep on talking, I dont care....(he just start to be silent...)   
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT??

			Just because things are different than what the norm is we think it is unswiss or people wouldn't be attached? The locals I hang out with are pretty proud genevois folks, with the whole shebang, UN, parks, politics, history, les Grottes, Maison Gruetli, ecole Voltaire, art scene and music scene, the debate club and chess at Bastions, whatever.    
There are headquarters of many other institutions in many other cities in CH and people probably feel attached as much as any other places. How about canton Schwyz...or Glarus? Do people feel part of Switzerland there? Because they yodel? Or because they spend an hour a day ping ponging  to fellow villagers? Or because there is no UN? Because there is no real work market for so many people who have big dreams?        
Yes, they do feel part of it, not that they like all of it, but big cities come with the good bits and the bad, just like anything else.    
Why have this weird idea of kidnappers who come and steal a place, when in fact, in reality, both new and old world are quite successfully and excitingly mixin'..

			New or Used. I need 3 to 4 pair of them for the Street Parade, mostly women's, 1 to 2, mens. Any idea where to start to look for them; used preferably? 
I am not so much interested in Ebay or Ricardo. I can't try them on, and would prefer to do so. I thought about Brocki's, but that might take far too long.  
Help, I have great ideas, but so little time.

4451	08.07.2011, 21:25	Junior Member	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: Geneva	"    First of all Shakur, I would   recommend you retake GCSE maths while completing your A Levels. Maudthecat was right, maths GCSE is required at grade C to get entry to most UK universities (the same is true for English Language). I'm surprised you have not seen this requirement as you said you've extensively researched for yourself. You mentioned Russell Group universities, I checked a couple:   require a C in GCSE maths, and   a B.      But you will be expected to have very good GCSE grades. From   '  And from   ' .' So your GCSE grades are important.   
Law is a very popular programme, something I think you have overlooked. It is especially competitive at the Russell Group universities. Having 3 A Levels at grade A isn't enough. For the top 10 ranked law programmes the average no. UCAS points on entry was about 500. 3 A grades at A Level is only 360 points. So you see the problem with having just 3 A levels. Also bear in mind that some universities require you to take the LNAT.   
I would suggest you do some more research and some serious thinking before going any further.

			Hi there,   
I found out today that I passed the HSG entrance exam and have been accepted on to an undergrad course starting in Sept.   
This came as a total surprise, as my German isn't great, and only very few applicants without german as a mother-tongue get in. (Apparently this year only four were accepted).   
Anyway if anybody on englishforum is/has already/will be studying at the HSG, I am eager to meet people and get some advice before I go!   
Any advice on housing/general preparation for studying at a Swiss Uni would also be very gratefully received!   
Thanks,   
Louis

			We had the same problem. 
Got a gas cylinder and regulator fro Migros Hobby. The BBQ flexible gas pipe previously was a ""push fit"" onto a Calaor gas regulator secured by a jubilee clip. I did the same with the Swiss one. It did need a lot of persuation but worked and is again secured by a jubilee clip. 
The UK HSE might have some issues with this but it works for us.

			Thanks for the advice everyone.  This being my first experience with ebay I wanted to be cautious.  I do understand a seller not wanting to use paypal for whatever reason. This guy probably isn't trying to scam me though I don't know if I would want to give up the paypal protection with an electonic item...regardless it seems that the paypal transaction is complete and I can't see any way to reverse it unless I file a complaint.  So that's what I told him, haven't heard back yet but hopefully I get my purchase!

			Well, if it looks abandoned, go for it. You could try a Ad at ronorp.net, I did that once and got several feedbacks, but not from the owner. But the chances are slim. Stadt Zürich collects the unlocked bikes and auctions them off, so it's gonna get taken anyway:   
I think that would be a good business idea, hallovelo.ch, where you can post abandoned bikes. There are so many in this city, as there are a lot of bicyle thieves. Not possible, legally...

Many Swiss are fairly content with the way the country is run, but perfect?       Again, these stereotypes have nothing to do with most Swiss. Few people would describe themselves as overly punctual or tidy, they just experience others as unpunctual and messy. I think it's a weird concept that you expect the Swiss to try to confirm to steretypes foreigners have of Switzerland. It's all relative, perfect we surely are not.       We cope with failure like everyone else. Stereotypes are sometimes useful to roughly classify things and customs in relation to others (Swiss vs. Italian punctuality) but if you start believing in stereotypes more than reality it starts to get a bit strange, it's as if you had no contact with real, human, imperfect, sometimes late, sometimes messy Swiss.    
I'd love to be considered perfect though, but that somehow clashes with reality.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Sep 2006	Groaned at 8 Times in 4 Posts	Being Swiss	Mary	Posts: 155

4491	null	null	null	null	"    Simple answer: Why not?   
I am German, coming from an area with relatively few jobs (besides tourism and wineries), so I did not really plan to move back home after university. Jobs were in Stuttgart and Munich, which are culturally both just as far away from my home as Zurich.    
Not sure what you want with the ""officially"" in bold but what I can tell you is: After things got better in the middle of last year have I been approached by headhunters from Germany several times. Never happened before in the same quality. They offered me salaries above my expectation. Lower than here but with the costs in Germany I would have been able to actually have a better life-style. Why did I not leave? They were typically in places I was not interested in moving to as my wife would have a hard time finding an interesting position there.   
Simple bottom line: If you move here, settle down and as a couple find both good jobs is it hard to move on quickly... but otherwise do I personally know quite a lot of Germans who went back within the last year - despite all the Euro worries and so on.   
More objective reasons: 
- The German economy can outperform most, but not the Swiss one... here are good jobs available and Germany is near. 
- We speak the language and are therefore usually better suited for Swiss jobs than UK, US or other applicants 
- The average German immigrant is better educated than his Swiss counterparts (because if a company finds a similarlily qualified Swiss applicant does the German typically not get the job...)

			Personally, I'm looking at a Masters degree.  I graduated from Purdue University with a bachelor degree in 2009 with a minor in French (GPA 3.6/4).  I have studied some German but am currently only at the A2/B1 level.  I would be looking to enter a masters program (most probably MBA) in fall 2012 and to further my German skills in the months leading up to that point... as long as I can get accepted!

			Hi, we have a portable air conditioner that we bought used. It's only 3 years old and we think it needs more freeon or whatever is put inside. Anyone have any recommendations on a service person/company that could come out and have a look for us and fix it? It would be cheaper to fix than buy a new one.    
Thanks!

			Hi Faye, I could alter the curtains for you. 
What is the width of each curtain?  What type of fabric are they? 
Sfr2.50 for voile curtains.  Sfr5 per a metre for thicker fabric, would be a rough quote 
I am in Hinwil, you could post the curtains to me, and I would post it back to you.

			I did not realize that these pebbles were ""painted"". When I looked at the ""this"" link and it pointed to IKEA then this started to to ring bells in my head. 
I can live with bedroom furniture which falls to bits every 5 years, but I have no intentions of disposing of a few tonnes of painted stones. 
The Naturstein is what I need - if these rocks have been in the earth for a few million years, hopefully they should last my lifetime in the back of my house. The bulk prices do not look so bad if you think of this longterm.

			Just slightly off topic from my original post... I saw this written up in ""20minutes"" this morning and I'm thinking it's a must have for every household in Switzerland.. our own mini stealth surveillance plane.   
I really want one.... shame they don't quote a price on^line         
 With help of the software e-mo-tion you can define a whole flight  path for the  CAM and direct it where to take the  pictures. Once the   CAM has landed you can download  those pictures from the photo camera. If you have basic computer skills,  then you will be easily able to operate the flight programming software  ""e-mo-tion"". With simple drag & drop functions it is possible to  pre-program, and update during flight, the position, altitude and  behaviour of the  .             
just think of the possibilities... finding out what those Russian girls next door have really been up to pool side.    "	null	null	null	mini- surveillance systems ?	guest	null

			Great news. We live at 950m and like you I left piles of twigs and leaves for any invertebrates to over-winter. But sadly, we returned from a weeks skiing to find thick ice and about 100 frogs dead all around the edge of the pool- disgusting and sad (although the local crows loved the feast after I'd fished them out and thrown on the next field. In the UK, I used to leave a couple of old football balls floating in the pond so that gases could escape around- and would pour a kettle of hot water on the pond to make a hole every day- but here it is not practical as it freezes up to (down to) - 30 here and the ice gets so thick. In the UK you can also buy an electric 'ball' which will keep a hole open all the time, but here it would not be practical (no electrics and too far from house). Any ideas to stop a mass kill next winter??   
Salamanders (newts) seem to cope well though- apparently they do over-winter outside the pond or perhaps dig themselves into the mud at the bottom.

I am glad nature here is Suisse appears so preserved and protected, although I do not miss the only beast I am afraid to encounter in european mountains - bear. We have plenty of them back home in Slovakia. Encounters are not so rare, and sometimes quite dramatic.

There isn't a Manor in Bern, but there is one in Thun, and also one in Shoppyland (yes, there really is one), in Schoenbuehl.  I think you can reach shoppyland via public transportation of just off the A1 north of Bern. I think the one in Thun is larger and it's quite near the train station. The stock in both places is somewhat limited.

I haven't had my hair cut since November last year and well, never thought Swiss summers could be this hot. I will try this hairdresser that you've recommended. I just want a layered trim (my hair is rather thick). I'll tell you how I get on. However, if you don't make it for your haircut this week, give me a shout, I would love to go with you.

			I don't know what the situation is here...   
But when I was in (psychiatric) hospital and a doctor rang up asking for details about me (long story, but they didn't have any right to do that is the short version), my psychiatrist and a nurse asked me if I knew why this person was calling and what I wanted them to say.    
It didn't help my recovery. I got very anxious and worried and it took a long time to sort out.   
I appreciate that you want to know if your friend is ok. But, as other people have said, I don't think the hospital will tell you, and (if your friend IS in hospital and is incommunicado because she doesn't want, for whatever reason, to communicate), it   cause her additional distress.    
I'm afraid I can't give you any advice on reporting her missing, but if you're still concerned and you haven't had news, I think that's a better solution than ringing up all the hospitals and asking if she's there.    
I hope that doesn't sound unsympathetic. I'm sure you're a great friend to be so concerned about her.

I agree with evilshell, if the company is paying then buy it there, it will be cheaper. We even had an agreement with my company and they paid for a second shipment (but we were coming from within EU)...good luck!

The team are arriving via Geneva.   
If anyone living around the Montreux area, with good connection to public transport (Gstaad) - would like to host these ladies for one week - I'm keen to hear from you - there are three - the coach is Australian (english-speaking) and the two team members speak english and french. They are happy to sleep on mattresses on the floor, and can cook themselves if necessary.   
Please PM me ASAP if you'd like to host.

			I'm looking for a workshop in Basel that I can rent for six months for use as a studio and darkroom.  It doesn't need to be a luxurious space, but needs to be reasonably large (50-60 sq.m), secure, light-tight, and have running water.   
Does anyone have any ideas about where I could look?   
Thanks in advance,   
Ian

			Thanks for this useful information!   
It's mostly high-end stereo equipment, so yes, it would be worth somewhat more than a transformer.    
At some point I'd consider selling my stereo equipment to someone moving back to North America, but for now, I'll have a look for a transformer.   
I was aware I could buy a transformer in Germany or France, there are usually some on ebay.de for example, but as has been noted the shipping really gets you.   
Anyway, if anybody knows a electronics surplus or hobbyist shop in Switzerland that might have transformers, let me know. In the meantime, I'll look again online...   
Thanks again!

it's worth a call to find out.   
otherwise, why not buy all the materials and let the girls try it out themselves? i remember having sleepovers with friends and putting makeup and all that on each other, it was fun. you can even make it a party- get a karaoke machine or something, just an idea.

Their other shop is walk-ins and by appointments and does mani and pedi... 
It is called The Nail Bar, and their website is

Very sorry to hear about your relative and you have to go through this. 
If your relative hasn't done this yet, then definitely try to get a second opinion (there are cancer forums/support groups where you can ask other patients for recommended specialists), and also don't hesitate to go abroad, eg. Germany to see a specialist, as unfortunately Switzerland is not always on top of everything in medicine.   
Regarding the MMS - I don't know about this product, but due to the experience with close family members going through cancer, I've met patients who had success battling their cancer with non-'western medicine', so if there is nothing left I would give it a go.  
Best wishes!

			I asked a similar question a few days ago and got a lot of useful answers - see  .   
Boesner (mentioned in the above post) have a big shop in Aarberg, between Biel and Bern.  Given the amount of stuff they have there, it's probably worth the drive from Zürich if there is nothing closer on the same scale.  It's five minutes from the motorway exit at Lyss-Süd.

			Okay I am posting this under the vague title of navigating inside IKEA but it has nothing to do with that.    
Someone I know   happened to be in Germany and thought ah these carpets would do just fine at home. Being a good and honest person they knew they would want to take them over the border into Switzerland and declare them so they could get that nasty 16% MwSt (VAT) back. They asked if they do the nice green pieces of paper that would allow them to take the carpets into Switzerland. Despite being in the middle of Germany (Frankfurt) they had no problem in providing the necessary paperwork and  parted company with their 600 and drove down over the border into CH.    
As there were three in the car there was no problem bringing the goods in and the nice Germans stamped my papers so that they could claim the VAT back. Of course when they got home and laid the carpets out they were astounded to find that they did not actually match their furnishings and would need to be returned. Shit!!! After scratching heads they thought okay lets try and take them back to Dietikon which is only 10 minutes drive instead of 3 hours. They gave them to the nice woman in Customer Information and told her they had lost the receipt and asked if they could give them back. She saw this as no problem at all, but said I can't give you cash back just a card loaded with money which you can spend in the store. Um okay well the alternative was worse and they wanted the carpets anyway... To their surprise the total cost of the carpets was actually CHF 1200 in CH... And the 16% VAT was still due - another CHF 150.   
So they wandered off bought the carpets in Dietikon in the right colour, kept the receipt, took them to Dietlikon a couple of days later and got their money ie cash back... They then bought the carpets next time they were in Frankfurt, the right colour this time and pocketed the money which was around CHF 500.   
So if ever you buy something from IKEA in Germany and want to give it back in CH it is not a problem and you will come out on top   
I am not quite sure what the moral of the story is. Just if you need to buy something expensive which is transportable it is probably cheaper in the German IKEA, you get the VAT back and you can still give it back in CH if you dont like it...

			Hello EFers,   
Could any one let me know that, where can I get this BENGAY Pain releafe creme in Zurich?   
Also, Please provide me the apothetic sites in Switzerland, Zurich.   
Thanks.

4599	null	null	null	null	"    Correct. PET recycling in Switzerland is for drink bottles only and not the PET used in other packaging. It was only after a couple of years of diligent sorting that I found that out. That's the reason why the recycling containers only have pictures of bottles on them.    
The milk carton recycling in supermarkets is for the white PE plastic material only.    
The high-density polyethylene (marked underneath as HDPE, PE-HD or   inside the triangle of arrows) used for regular shampoo and soap bottles does not belong in the PET or PE recycling and should go in the normal garbage.     , in German.

			Hello there, we would but you are little too far for a jam  
Good luck with your search, you can usually find musicians at gigs, chilling together and networking, or, post a message at a local conservatoire, there are always bunch of musicians there that play other than classical music.

			Hello EF members  
I have a Lithuanian friend who has recently moved here and is in need of some countrymate interaction and basic city orientation. I, of course also freely provide my services as a guide to 'all things swiss', but not being from the same country, I wondered whether they are any Lithuanians on here, potentially willing to give her an hour here and there for some basic intro to the city or helpful ideas...If you are interested, please send me a PM and I'll help arrange. She lives in Wollishofen. Cheers, Q

			Actually it depends where you live. Our Commune charges for water consumed as per the meter, then a charge for purification treatment of said amount of water then on top of that it applies a charge on a sliding scale which works out at between 0.3% to 0.5% of the insured value of your home. 
This latter is payable regardless of the amount of water you use, so it amounts to a water tax. It makes our water bills ridiculous. 
The same process applies to sewage bills, except the tax is 0.7% of the insured value of your home. 
Bargain? Ha!

			So I just dropped off all of my household goods to be shipped.  Among them were several items that I didn't want to leave in just cardboard boxes or plastic totes due to concern over them being damaged.   
I ended up building a couple of wood (oriented strand board only) crates for the shipment.  In all it cost me less than $30 (with plenty of leftover material) at Home Depot to build a 5' x 1' x 2.5' crate (see picture) for my mountain bike and many other smaller items to keep things from moving around during shipment.   
I bought the following items: 
Two 4' x 8' x 1/2"" sheets of OSB (oriented strand board) = $14 
Two boxes of 1"" long screws = $4 
One box of 1-1/4"" long screws = $4 
Two boxes of steel L-angles(8 total) = $6   
The only tools I needed were a circular saw and drill.  I also used a couple of wood horses for supports while cutting and I had some clamps and a long 2x4 to use as a straight edge while making the cuts.   
Hopefully this information is useful to someone as I spent a lot of time mulling over how to safely ship my goods before I finally decided to build the crates.   
If one decides to build  a crate made of wood, it must be plywood, OSB, or some other engineered wood material as solid wood is subject to several rules/regulations to keep unwanted insects from being imported.  The entire crate I made is of OSB (the cheapest), including interior bracing.

			Just for the record and because nobody else mentioned it... you said that you want to study programming. While I do not know what US universities are like can I tell you that you will not program that much in your undergraduate course at a research university like the ETH - you will study a huge amount of ""how computers actually work"" in theory before you actually sit in front of one.   
While many of the scientists on here might not like the idea - for most students is a more applied approach actually the better one. Switzerland has a list of good engineering schools known as ""Applied university"" or ""Fachhochschule"". Their courses do not have the reputation of the ETH. I know that the US works a bit different in that perspective as I come from a country where people do not really care about university rankings. But for me was it far more important if the school offers  
- a curriculum that matched my interests 
- an environment that suits me.

			Ok, as others said: go to the cops. The sooner the better. I would not at all be surprised to see some cop who asks some questions. That's their job after all. The ""undercover"" ones I have seen in Zurich during football games or even in the city apparently chasing some drug dealers looked just as you described: Jeans and t-shirt, some badge on a chain.   
However: I very much doubt that a cop would ask you to enter your appartment after you said that you don't have the info.    
That he din't come back is maybe not too suspicious: If he was a cop he either got his info elsewhere or arrested your neighbour in the meantime.   
So: Could be a real cop, but if there is a guy running around imposing as one, the Stadtpolizei would surely like to know it. You don't want to read about some crime in 20 mins in a week and think ""if I only..."".

			Hornbach had some nice wooden playhouses, the kind you assemble yourself. I'm afraid I didn't look at the prices  - but generally Hornbach has decent prices, usually lower than 'native' CH stores...)   
However, do make sure that you are allowed to put up a Kinderspielhaus. In some areas, these fall under the same regulations as garden sheds - meaning either written permission from your neighbors or even a permit might be required.   
(Sounds crazy, I know...)   
The issue, at least here, seems to be height and permanence..

			As a regular visitor I have used the Post Buses to visit areas not covered by the extensive train network.  If you haven't taken a trip on one of these routes before, I can thoroughly recommend them.   
If you travel one of the Alpine Pass routes check in advance if a reservation is needed or if a surcharge applies.  This applies to just a few routes.

			I bought a few memory foam pads to put on top of my mattress and found them to be very hot. You really do sink into them and this caused me to be uncomfortable because of the trapped body heat. But I do not think everyone will feel this way. Do you like to sleep in a cool room or warm? Do you like to have lots of covers or not? I suspect if you are a 'hot"" sleeper, you won't like the memory/Tempur foam.   
Regarding mattresses/slats, I bought one set in Germany at Lutz and another at Ikea in Zurich. They were both mid priced models (mattress and slats) and both are comfortable. The trickiest part is the mattress firmness. I like firm to extra firm. But if you put a memory foam pad over the mattress, it won't really matter.   
I am used to the spring mattresses in the US, so it was difficult to get used to the system here. If you want the box spring style, Westin Hotels sells their 'Heavenly Bed' in Europe ( ). It is very comfortable, but pricey in Europe. We will buy one when we return to the US.   
Good luck!

			If you're interested in the history of Basel, then I'd like to recommend the book   by Peter Habicht, which I've just finished reading.   
It might not be the most comprehensive history (to be fair, it describes itself as concise) but it covers right from prehistoric times up to just a few years ago.   
The book is written in a light, easy to read manner.  The author writes with humour (in that funny way that foreigners try irony  ) and the book is quite chatty.   
Most of all, though, the book has lots of ""Oh.  That's why..."" moments.  It was also interesting to read about how much power the church and the guilds had, and how that power was eventually lost.   
I don't think I've seen any other English history books about Basel.   
Keep an eye out for it in the Basel bookshops (it looks like you might be able to buy it online too on the above link).      "	null	null	null	History of Basel - Book Recommendation	guest	null

			Don't know if you'll be able to sell your clothes to a second hand shop round here, most of them are charities I think, so donations expected, but to be honest, it's not something I've ever tried.  Maybe some fo them just look like charity shops.   
I've seen a couple of places selling second hand electrical stuff, they'll probably buy your electronics, no idea how much they'll give.

			I'm currently considering a six month contract in Switzerland, and am flying out to Zurich for a couple of days, mainly to meet the team I'd be working with and to get realistic feedback on the concerns I have around accommodation, living costs, likelihood of project to extend beyond initial 6 month contract etc.   
I've got a day completely free before I meet my potential work colleagues, so what would folk recommend I check out/visit to get my best ""feel"" for what working in Switzerland will be like.   
I'm staying centrally at the Movenpick and my first thoughts were check the basics like supermarket, post office etc. and perhaps look around for accommodation in the suburbs and check out some travel routes  but if anybody's got any specific recommendations I'd appreciate it.   
Thanks,

If you'd have been clever and waited for the check to clear, then after three days it would and the funds would be there in your account, ready for you to send your car and his change.  You'd be very happy until the funds disappeared from your account a few days after that because clearing isn't really clearing.

As stated above, if you order from Switzerland you effectively get another 12% discount, the goods are already prepacked for transportation and probably (?) insured. There is also an import duty per kg but it doesn't amount to much but I am not sure of the rate on furniture.

			Well I would say to start with there would be two ""travel"" days per week: combined pick up and drop off. We would then have more than that, and eventually get a half-shop front as a drop off area where you can dump a sack with a label and we'll collect from there, just in case you aren't around for pick up/drop off.

			We are looking to exchange our home/car/boat in Juneau, Alaska with a homeowner in the SwissFrench part of Switzerland(preferrable near a large ski resort) beginning in 1/12 for 1 to 3 months. Juneau is the capital of Alaska and it is an absolutely amazing place with an abundance of wildlife(sea and land) and yet the city is quite cosmopolitan and is only a short ferry ride and drive away from the Yukon(Whitehorse and beyond). There are glaciers, whales, seals, bears, amazing hiking trails, berry picking, a great ski resort(Eaglecrest), and more. Please PM with questions and offers.

			Hello,   
I'm looking to develop my ear for Zurideutsch with volunteer opportunities. I'm comfortable with high German and would like to be an active listener for the local dialect -- I struggle with Zurideutsch.    
Is volunteering at a retirement home a good idea? I'm a recent addition to Zuerich from the UK-- any recommendations would be much appreciated.   
Thank you for your help!

I am also shopping for baby goods at the moment, and as mentioned above, Baby 1 and Baby Walz are good shops to try over the border.  I also found Ikea in Basel were cheaper for things like cots etc. once I compared prices, so keep this in mind

The gun and ammunition are then returned at the end of military service.   
I've been here for many years but have never met anyone that goes shooting for fun.  The sentiment among my husband's friends and colleagues is that military service is a pain that has to be endured for 2 weeks a year and the rifle and related equipment takes up precious space in the cellar.

			If you have a good and relevant(more or less) BA as well as speaking German, I don't see any problems in getting accepted on your course. Provided you can pay the fees and support yourself. I have no idea how tough your chosen course is, but judging from the fact that many foreign students are doing courses here because they can't get on a decent course in their home countries, I suspect that they might be a little more relaxed about entrance criteria than some other places.

Here's the limited rooting variety:       
Also it does help significantly to dig them deep and surround the plant with a special synthetic tube/ring which forces the roots to go deeper before shooting outwards.

I bought a Canon IXUS 75 as we were leaving Australia just before new year (literally, picked it up on the way to the airport).  About a month later I managed to drop it onto a cement floor and break it.  Naturally, the Australian warranty was worthless here so I went to get a new one - I picked up an identical camera from   (highly recommended - I've been there several times, everyone I've ever spoken to has had excellent English) for about CHF50  than I paid in Australia (and I paid well under retail there).

			Whatever your residence permit you will need to be fluent in the local language. Just click on the university site for the university you want to study at and you can get all the information you need about requirements etc. + numbers to ring for further information. If your local language skills aren't enough to cope with that, I suspect they won't be enough to cope with your studies. I checked out the unizh site and it's all there, so I imagine the French language sites must be similar. There are links to the entrance requirements for students with foreign qualifications, as well as info. about the aptitude tests and enrolment dates for them.  
I suspect that studying here has got to be cheaper than in the UK, but you still need to be able to finance the fees and support yourself during the first few years study as you will need to get through the early exams where there is a fairly high reject rate.

			On our hikes we often come across 'Waldhütten', huts in the woods of varying sizes with places to grill food and seating and tables outside and inside. Some are newer and more luxurious than others; some you can drive to, some it's Shanks' pony, but there is often a lovely atmosphere in the woods and not too many people around to complain about the noise and the smoke.    
You could try   or ask in the Parish offices;  
or this general Site -  ; the buildings belonging to the   are also let out sometimes. You may well have to ask locally though.

Welcome to the Forum.   
I've closed this Thread, as it is hopeless trying to give you sensible and helpful answers in one area of the Forum concerning six separate subjects which all belong elsewhere.   
I know it is difficult to find some things on here, but a bit of basic research, the Stickies at the top of each sub-Forum will answer some of your questions without you spending too long on it, would sort some queries before we start answering.   
So, I suggest you do a day's research - and I mean really look, not glance quickly through Threads. Check the rulings and the law; some of the links are in English and are the official sources.    
Then you can write a short Intro and afterwards post your questions in the Forums where they belong. But PLEASE do your homework first.

			@Lauragestewart  & Quax 
""inexpensive and huge variety"" and ""buy everything"" It seems to come down to that better to bring as much as possible. It totally makes sense!   
I guess aside from basic stuff that can be ok with whatever (say like, sweatpants @ home) I will max out my budget and buy things (yay! legit excuses for shopping spree!!)    
Q1: But then, we have to consider shipping cost vs buying there, right? 
My guess is that big/heavy stuff like furniture should be replaced @ Zurch unless they are very special. What are the thoughts?     
Q2: Also, there are alot of shipping services right now like:   
If there's a huge price differences AND they are small and light, I might want to have it mailed through them. Any thoughts?

			Correct, and that's a technique often done on plane trees, which you can find most often on waterfronts, boulevards and the like. For the Americans among us, American plane trees are what you call sycamore.    
Pollarding is used not only to achieve a very dense foliage but also to keep the size if the tree at bay. Planes can grow very big. There's an unpollarded one in the front yard of a hotel here that can easily cover a wedding reception with 150 people, tables included, and they have to regularly prune it down on two sides in order to keep the streets free for trucks.

You will end up having to upgrade the case for larger and more fans, probably having to WC the cards and then playing with earphones on. If I were you |I would wait for Crysis 2 to come out and see what cards are better suited.  Most Hi-Res benchmark crowns belong to a single 5970 at the moment. Perhaps a better option.

			Dear all,   
I need a book to prepare for an interview. The book is titled ""quant job interview questions and answers"" by Mark Joshi. I am not able to find it on amazon.de and amazon.co.uk. It is also not available on books.ch. It is quite expensive to ship it from US and the interview might be over by the time I get the book. If anybody owns it, I would like to borrow it for two weeks. It will be of great help.   
Thanks in advance 
Anu

So they obviously do not want transparency...   
The chance that somebody would find a more expensive shop online is relatively limited. Only interdiscount and Fust are possibly more expensive. If they'd list their prices, people would by more at digitec and other discount shops... instead of walking into MediaMarkt and buy something there.

			Good morning,   
I'm a student of the 3rd,so last year,in science of mouvement and sport course of the faculty of Medicine. In june i'll finish courses but not exams because in these 3 years i didn't collect my 180CFU but not having more lessons to follow in my city in Genoa i had the idea to joint next year the ERASMUS PLACEMENT in the french part of CH. 
Erasmus student placement is a period between 3 and 12 months while a student can make a stage in one european foreign state or out from europe only in Ch and other 4 states. 
The student should just find one sport association that accept to take him with them 1 year.. The should not pay (even if i hope i would receive something of corse not a lot) and they should do nothing more burocratic.. The student will fixe everything.. Then i dont know how it works in CH so anyway the need to do more things like declare a foreign student etc.. But nothing more directly for the agreement university-structure.   QUESTION:   
1)To make a stage there 12 months do i need some assurance or other documents?? How should i organizate my steps? 
2) Suggestion of sport structures(french part)??    
Every suggestion will be nice to read about structures can be public or private organization about sport me i would like sport club fitness/body building also if possible with courses of vertebral gymnastic and Kinesiterapy  
other place football teams,swimming pools,volleyball,.. can be okay.   
Thank to all the answers!

I once helped a friend out  (cleaning her restaurant a couple times when she had staff problems) and she stated quite clearly that I was doing it as her friend, should I have an accident on the premises.  I got free coffee, and lunches .... and a bit of ""trink geld"" handed over surepticiously a few days later.   
The biggest fear of ""employing"" persons to do odd jobs is the insurance .... they could end up crippled .... and you end up with no pension money, no house, etc.   
Stupid situation, but that`s how it is.   
You could maybe ask for help, with food and drinks (coffee/water/cokes) .... and then a few bucks at end of day for their ""trink geld"" ......?   NOT official ""employment?    
As an aside, maybe of interest and related .... I do voluntary work at the local school, and am informed that I`m covered by their insurance the moment I leave my property to attend the school (slipping on ice, falling off my bicycle, getting hit by an auto, falling down stairs, etc etc).  And I don`t even get paid for doing this bit of ""work"".

			I've just noticed that you're Greek... in which case, I shall adapt my advice accordingly:   
Invite me and the rest of the Swiss rembetes round. We'll bring our baglamades, a nargile or two, and plenty of tsipouro to go round. We'll make sure there's at least one fat taxi driver amongst us to do the zeimbekiko round his glass of whisky. We'll sing, play and make merry, spill wine on your carpets and ash on your divan, then fall into a deep hashish reverie as the last fully conscious member of the group sings a plaintive mane before crashing out with his arms wrapped around your lavatory bowl.   
In the morning, we'll invite a priest round to bless your house, being sure to provide a cockerel to strangle, too.   
Then, as you prepare your dolmades and (specially for me, having come up with such a brilliant idea to make your house into a true home) kleftiko, you'll look back at the previous 24 hours and wonder how you ever lived there before the manges brought a bit of spirit into the place.

			There is a musical instrument shop on Brunngasse in the Niederdorf. Look for the square with the Hotel Wellenberg on the corner. The shop is half way down on the left hand side. They sell many 'World Instruments' and they should have didges. I not sure of they are traditional or of the tourist variety.    
Also try Musik Hug on Limmat-quai.

			This is the first time I receive such called 'Delivered to letterbox'. Before that I always picked up my stuff at the post office, because I'm usually not at home and the postman always leaves me a note for the pick up (and they gave it status 'Delivered over counter' on the tracking webpage).    
But this time there wasn't any note from the postman (I always carefully check all the paper junk in order not throw away some important letter), nor the item in the letterbox - only 'Delivered to letterbox' status on the tracking webpage.

You then have 3 months to return to this Lidl and effectively use this as a coupon to get money off your next shop.   
Also remember to bring back any PET bottles you bought in Germany as the deposit you pay can easily be 50% of the drink price

I live on the 'wrong' shore of Lake Zürich and on a nice day with föhn we can see Säntis standing out boldly against the sky and in the evening, if the sun shines on the tower, we can see that too.    
Far away is a 'vague' phrase.  
Walking up the Feldberg in the Black Forest (Germany) we heard a Dad saying to his son, look, Eiger, Mönch, Jungfrau. Mr. L and I looked at each other and raised our eyebrows but turning round to check, that's just what we saw, not very big, but clear as you like.

Her son will encounter plenty of germs in the outside world to build up resistance as it is, and I hardly think washing new clothes constitutes ""everything he touches"".   
Even without any germ/faeces/etc etc matter factored into it, washing them first (barring knitwear) makes them softer and less irritable on the skin, which many people are sensitive to.

			Hello and thanks for the advise but i still dont know what to do. The other comment said the pitch of the 3/4 should be the same as a regular sized guitar. Mine have both steel and nylon, i dont mind. Ive tried other guitars also mixed steel and nylon but mine just doesnt seem to work as the steel strings are was too loose (although in tune already) and the nylon (also in tune) are way too tight. When i strum, the vibrations from the steel are just annoying. Maybe i should try again this time with an audio reference. But if someone would tell me that i should stick with either only steel or only nylon, then ill try that too coz i already spent many hours tuning this thing.

			This site is excellent for student accommodation:     
By far the cheapest way to live as a student is in a ""WG"", where you take a bedroom in a flat you share with other students.     
As a bonus, being in a WG means you meet other students straight away, who can show you around the university and the city.  You also don't have to arrange things like utilities/phone/internet on your own.   
Don't worry about being too far away either - you can cycle to the university from anywhere in the entire canton of Basel-Stadt in about 15 minutes!  The public transport is good too.

thats 55 watts, if you use it on somthing like a kettle it will melt, the tranformer should be way above the wattage of your appliance, way above!!   
I used a transformer on a TV from the USA in the uk, it was the 'correct' wattage, but after about 10 minutes it totally melted, lucky I was around to see, and smell it, and turn it off before it caught fire!!!

			I'm a solar man myself. The way I see it, the world's getting warmer anyway. True, solar is currently insanely expensive and inefficient, but there's a lot of desert in the world, and if every penny the world spends on oil was diverted to solar power we could blanket the sahara and some other deserts in solar cells in no time. And we'd really only have to spend the money once. Then we could roll around in electric cars too. We just need the price of oil to reach 200 USD/bbl and stay there for a while and all our energy needs will be solved.

Sure, you can get a soldering iron at Migros (and yes, I mean Migros, not Obi -- bigger ones carry soldering gear) or whatever. But for components, you need a real electronics place.

			Right, after your post, some job opening seem funny. Take this for instance:   - I think they say written German (so High?), they don't even bother to say as ""native"", they just say from ETH.   
European geographical and urban street layouts, and transit systems... I think just memorizing the city map is a bit more complex because of the non-parallel and non-perpendicular streets. I happen to like that.   
It's sad that not all swiss people like cows - I always imagined the little swiss mountain villages along with those old Milka commercials.

			actually, I noticed lately that they are not using the Post Office anymore but are instead using courier service like DHL.    
Should be better, but for me it is worse because now every delivery needs my signature and I am of course not home all the time so have to reschedule, etc. etc.

			Hi,   
I'm not a specialist in this field, but my 2 cents are: 
As you want to study in Switzerland, study something which is officially recognized in Switzerland.   
Why? 1) It will facilitate job search if you want to stay in Switzerland. 2) The Swiss education system is of an overall good quality. 
Second thing to think about : be sure your studies have some Bologna scheme value (google with Bologna Process). 
Why? 1) If going abroad for a job, it'll be possible for your future employer to understand what your diploma means. 2) The Swiss diplomas are considered to be of good quality.   
Why not try your MBA as you mentionned and go back into the aircraft world.   
But nobody can tell you what you could end up doing.  I know a guy who is a doctor in theology and he ended up an ambassador.  It's all about opportunity, right spot-right place and perseverance in the meanders of live, methinks.

			Which Ikea did you go to ?   
Ikea Schwertzenbach (Dietikon Zurich) had a large range when we were there a few months back.   
Ikea Dietlikon does not have much...   
You can also check Ikea online to see what they have in stock - I search the catalogue in the UK or Australian site, find the product name and then search the .ch site to find the same product. The website will tell you if its in stock...   
Also, if you are in Zurich try the Zurcher Brockenhaus - near HB - they had quite a lot there last time I was in...

			I saw a local sign of someone selling firewood in bulk, 1 "" "" ( 1 cubic meter, or 1 m3) cost 170 CHF. At the local Coop it costs 8 CHF for a small box of 0.042 m3. If I divide 1 m3 by 0.42 m3 I come up with 24, meaning 24 boxes of Coop wood would equal the one large ""raummeter"" selling for 170 CHF. 24 Boxes of Coop wood would equal 24 x 8CHF = 192 CHF. So as far I see, there's not really any advantage of buying wood in bulk (well ok, a very small savings of maybe 10% or so).    
Usually in other places I've lived, buying firewood in bulk is  substantially cheaper than buying boxed wood at the supermarket, but  here it seems to be about the same price. Or am I calculating this wrong, or am I missing something?   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2008	Groaned at 38 Times in 36 Posts	Is Fire-wood Cheaper in Bulk?	esto	Posts: 1,272

			It really depends on what field you are looking to study. In terms of the reputation of the University as a whole, Neuchatel isn't a patch on ETH or EPFL.   
Some of the more famous and more prestigious departments of UNINE are no longer UNINE. Such as IMT, which is now EPFL, and was world famous in microtechnology.

			I recently acquired  , which unfortunately let me down only a few weeks later when the internal air pump went on strike. I suspect the pressure sensor for some reason does not signal to the pump that it should activate and pump out the air in the beverage container. The pump itself could be dead but I doubt it, since it used to turn itself on sporadically before it completely ceased to work.   
I contacted the after-sales service and I was told I should send it back through the retailer. The problem is that the product was bought on an online private shopping club in France that will only refund the money. I don't want to go through the hassle of sending this relatively heavy piece of machinery back to France without getting a new one in exchange, so I was wondering if I could get it repaired here. Perhaps by someone with DIY skills? The dispenser is still under guarantee so I need someone who really knows what s/he's doing.

Stoos is a bit of a pain to get to the top but once you're there, it's worth it.

			I'm part of a documentary in production which is looking at expats. In essence, it's about why some people are drawn to travelling around and living in other countries where most people stay at home.   
I'm interested in hearing from expats who have a story to tell.    
If you might be interested in being a part of the documentary I'd love to hear from you, initially by email where I'd be interested to hear your story. With some people it might be interesting to film them tell their story as well.   
There's more information laid out here:

			Have a look at  . They have several different levels of qualifications you can do all the way up to professional accountant. Exams are held in Bern in June and December every year.    
I have tought these courses in the past but am fully booked on other projects right now. I'm not sure if anyone else is teaching them here in Switzerland but you can do distance learning courses to prepare for the exams yourself (e.g.  ). There are quite a few students from the Big 4 accountancy firms in Switzerland doing these exams via the distance learning route so you might get some support from other students.   
Good luck if you decide to go down that route!

If you intend to buy a Panerai or Rolex, the discount won't be so high due to the high demand and low offer.

If you call your insurance they should be able to give you a document detailing coverage for vaccinations or just answer your questions directly over the phone.    
MMR and TD need to be boosted every ten years. I've never had a meningitis vaccination so that one must be new. Tuberculosis tests are done by making a small injection just under the surface of the skin on the underside of your forearm. You then go back and have a doctor look at it within 24-48 hours. They can tell by the way your body reacts whether or not you're a carrier of TB.    
In the US a TB test is $10-25. These are routine vaccinations and tests and you don't need to be going somewhere exotic to need them. In the US all teachers and daycare workers are required to have a TB test every year.    
Call the insurance to find out the costs, but I imagine they'll cover all or most as it's definitely in their best interest for you to have these!!

			Dear EFers,   
Recently I have been schmoozing with some colleagues from work and was invited to apply for a job that they're opening up soon. It would primarily involve requirements traceability (cleaning up the requirement analysts' mess?  ) and risk management tasks. I have minimal (1-2 years) experience in writing and tracing contractual requirements as well as 7 years experience in technical documentation.   
...However I have no formal qualification to support this. The project leader would be willing to support me with a course, if I hunt one down and show him the details. Is there anyone out there who could suggest a good online course or workshops in Zürich, Luzern, Zug etc? I've looked for options online, but there are so many it's hard to fish out the good ones

			Starting PhD salary isn't easy to live on, but it totally possible, you just have to be creative and smart about it.   
Zurich CAN actually be a very cheap place to live in. It really comes down to how 'elegant' of a lifestyle you want to live.   
How bad you want that Dr. title vs. living the nice clothes-car-sweetapartment lifestyle.   
Flatsharing will definitely be your first option--unless you're really lucky with finding a nice cheap pad.   
If you cancel eating out to less than once a week (average) you will have the most savings there.    
The rest of your costs are easily decided by wants/needs comparison.   
Good luck in whatever your decision is.

			It's a Fisher and Paykel... looks like they dropped it, and it is dinged all over the side. If it wasn't insured, I wouldn't bother with this, but have to go through the process of getting a quote in order to claim it. I think if the cost of the repair exceeds the declared value, and they accept the claim, they just give me that.   
I found this mob who are the dealer for Switzerland:  . I'll contact them, but would also be happy to hear any recommendations for other repairers in the Zurich area if anyone has them.

			Yes definitely learn some German, but then again in Zurich you can manage without, well according to people on the forum here (I cannot judge this because I do not know Zurich). Switzerland is like the Netherlands was 20-30 years ago. That is what it feels like anyway, less crowded, safer, more space. But bureaucracy is worse than in the NL.   
There is a good thread here somehwere that compares Canada and Switzerland. Have a search, it has excellent info on the cultural and natural differences. I would say Switzerland has much more to offer than the NL scenery wise; the main drawback is social life compared to the NL but if you are in a family phase, it is probably less of a problem.

			ars-imago are my nearest camera shop. They have a wide range of film sizes, and carry newly manufactured B+W film stock in long obsolete sizes. They sell a lot over the internet, and you can walk in and get their internet prices over the counter. It's nice to see a camera shop that is slowly expanding its film related offerings and services. When I bought some Provia 400X from them (120 and 35mm) it came straight out of a fridge in the back.

But don't just stare - that is a bit too much integration for me - call the police.

			Hi guys I'm organizing an event in Biel/Bienne - town where I'm at.   
It is for fun - I'm friends with the main guy of the local Congress  Hall, I recently helped them out with setting up their stage/sound for  some events they've done so just out of good will he said to me if I'd  like to use the Hall let him know and it's mine so I've made an idea up  that I want to put out there.   
It's going to be a family event but more aimed at the youth of the  town - anything from 15 - 25 in the crowd is what I'm aiming for.   
NO DATES have been planned but I have some ideas in my mind, sometime  MARCH or APRIL. Dates will be planned and I have a lot of options with  the congress hall but first I want to know what I want to do in terms of  talent.   
What I am looking for is anyone who thinks they have a ""performance  talent"" - Play a piano? Sing? Dance in a group of friends you know of?  Dance individually? Breakdance? Good voice and bags of confidence  because I'm also looking for a co-host for the evening   
The way I plan it is for - a performance, and then I have some guest  speakers in between performances who will stand up and tell their story -  it will be a story about something hard they went through in life and  how they overcame it.   
I've done things like this before during university - I understand  this is a different situation, people may have to travel here from the  likes of Geneva/Zurich or wherever you guys are so all travel expenses I  will cover and will try to arrange some food!   
I will give more information but first I'd like to know if there are  any people here who are interested and think they have a talent to  showcase and obviously, you need confidence. You'll be standing  up/performing infront of roughly 400-500 people.   
Let me know / get in touch and we'll sort something out. It will be unique and an experience for sure.

			Help! My husband, toddler son and I are seriously considering moving to Zurich (or environs)following hubby's possible job relocation, and were recently over to have a look. We would need to live in a low tax area to make the move work financially, and ideally I would like to keep working full time. We loved Zug and to a lesser extent the areas above lake Zurich and don't necessarily need a lake view, but are having a problem ""joining the dots"" (in terms of childcare + 180m living space + transport into Zurich + some outdoor space).    
Are there any other working mums that have made the transition from London to Zurich successfully (those that have stay at home partners please don't respond as my husband will be working).   
Any tips or suggestions gratefully received.

			My ex's cousins girlfriend (soon to be wife) comes from the french speaking region in canada. Before attempting to move here she got a lot of very positive responses from hospitals wanting to employ her (she was a head ER nurse in canada or something).   
Anyway long story short, she arrived here on a tourist visa to scope things out and apparently she wasn't eligible to work due to some red cross rule stipulating that she needed some documentation rubber stamped or something to work as a nurse in switzerland and that could take up to two years. Go figure.   
On the other hand my ex is training as a nurse so am very happy to know that there should be plenty of work for her when she's finished.

			Blimey, where did you all come from!     
Summerrain, Treverus, Christacorn - thanks for the book suggestions - the phrasebook is a very good idea, wish I'd thought of it.  His German's not so great, so it needed to be in French or English really, but your suggestions for travel books/guides to Chinese culture are great and I will pass on to his ""real"" colleagues in his office who are collecting for him this week.  Not sure if he's a gamer, but that's a good idea for absorbing some culture maybe - probably safer than the outfit...   
Carol.jin - he's off there on Friday I'm afraid (Trev, he'll be tied up with lucky red ribbon, so no trouble with Customs), so unless you offer a one-day mind-meld service over the internet, there probably isn't time - but I do appreciate the offer and the thought, thank you.   
Swissdom - thanks, I did actually think about a buddha, I'd googled Chinese good luck charms and had some ideas.  If I hadn't hit on the Wallpaper guide my next question to the forum was going to be, do you know any Chinese shops in Basel.  A google search returned only restaurants, no Chinatown down the road any more... (I moved from Manchester last year).  But if anyone does know, for future reference... ?   
To all, I did indeed find something for him last week (the French edition of the Wallpaper guide to Shanghai, I had to get a wiggle on as I wasn't sure I'd see him this week), and he was very pleased with it, but your answers are great, and I'm sure he won't be the last heading off there, so keep posting!   
Thanks!   
PS I'm a 'she'

			Hi all,   
I have a massive delivery of IKEA furniture arriving tomorrow afternoon, and I've got no chance assembling it on my own. Looking for a few friendly pairs of hands that might like to help me assemble in return for a beer or two and general good samaritan brownie points...   
If you are able to assist on either Tuesday and/or Wednesday evening, please PM me with you email address or telephone number.   
Cheers

			Depends on their condition.  You can get either watch for around 2300 CHF from a reputable ""grey market"" retailer brand new, which will typically represent a 30% discount to normal retail price.

			Hi, I am a 3rd year Canadian international business student. I have been tasked with finding out information regarding the following:   
1) What is the frequency of people moving houses and/or places.   
2) Are there a large number of land developments and construction pertaining to housing and/or general living.   
3) How receptive would you be (Both individually and as a country) to the possibility of using renewable packaging boxes that do not harm the environment and can be re-used as often as needed for a slight extra cost.   
My project requires us to find primary data that is why I need to ask around to see what we can find. Essentially the project requires us to market renewable packaging boxes to Switzerland so if you could offer any assistance that would really be greatly appreciated!!!   
PS. Since this is primary data I am going to need a name after each response, if you are uncomfortable with publishing your name, then don't worry about the name!!   
Thanks a lot!!

4947	10.02.2011, 14:53	Junior Member	Thanked 16 Times in 6 Posts	Location: Basel	"   Please see below for details of a new meditation class starting in March.     Prayers and Meditation for World Peace - Saturday morning 10.15 - 11.45am   March 5 - April 2   with Kelsang Khandro Location:  Bodhichitta Zentrum, Turnerstrasse 26, CH - 4058 Basel   (a short walk from Wettsteinplatz tram station)  Class fee: CHF 15/class or CHF 50/ 5 classes  
 These Saturday morning classes will follow the book "" Modern Buddhism"" by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso and are dedicated to creating peace in the world through developing wisdom and improving our intentions. Classes are open to anybody on a drop-in  basis. They can be attended individually or as a series. They include 2  guided meditations, simple buddhist prayers for meditation, a teaching  explaining the meditation and time for questions and discussion. The  teaching, meditation and prayers are in English. No previous knowledge or experience required.
      "".. Happiness and suffering are states of mind and so their main  causes are not to be found outside the mind. If we want to be truly  happy and free from suffering, we must learn how to control our mind.  When things go wrong in our life and we encounter difficult situations,  we tend to regard the situation itself as our problem, but in reality  whatever problems we experience come from the side of the mind. If we  were to respond to difficult situations with a positive or peaceful mind  they would not be problems for us; indeed, we may even come to regard  them as challenges or opportunities for growth and development. Problems  arise only if we respond with a negative state of mind. Therefore, if  we want to be free from problems, we must transform our mind. Buddha  taught that the mind has the power to create all pleasant and unpleasant  objects. The world is the result of the Karma, or actions, of the  beings who inhabit it. A pure world is the result of pure actions  and  an impure world is the result of impure actions. Since all actions are  created by mind, ultimately everything, including the world itself is  created by mind. There is no creator other than mind.""

			Are traffic cops serious?   
Usual Sunday morning we were driving on E60 with wify to church in Dübendorf round about 11h00. The traffic was moving smoothly until out of the blue there is a sudden cars pile-up, so I slammed on the brakes giving my brake pads a nice wear. The other drivers in adjacent lanes including myself were trying to guess the cause of this confusion and they started pulling off to the right lane. Few minutes later a traffic cop's big Bimmer emerged on the horizon with stopped guy just in the middle of the traffic flow. Then the policeman pulled to the emergency lane and a bulky cop with crewcut no 1 who projected wide grin on his face was frowning at other cars like it is normal to stop anyone and anywhere as he pleased.

			You will need toughened or laminated glass with polished edges, not something a glass shop can do in house.  I did find a few companies in the ZH area who can do thus but it is very expensive.

			Hi there! Not sure if your bed frame has enough clearance to allow, but  you can probably just put a Swiss/Euro mattress set on the frame. It's  only a few cm difference. Shouldn't be a problem unless the frame is somehow restrictive.    
One idea would be to buy a mattress from a shop that has a return policy and delivery, have them deliver and install, and if it doesn't fit right there and then just ask the delivery men to take it back.

			It has been around for a while now, they also do a Sat morning reading for kids, which one has to sign up for, get on their mailing list. The don't do them regularly. Books are lovely, there is a little reading and playing corner too, they are helpful and willing to order. Very expensive, though, which is probably expected, with books and all..They theme up their window for every holiday, season, etc. It's fun.

I have thought about this many times, and I still do as its the safest option.  The only downside to the museum option is the true value will be known, which may lead to my son or his son wanting to auctioning it off for the money.  (But then again I could make some legal document forbidding this from happening)  Plus I wont be able to see it very often.  Once you hold it you dont want to let it go, it seems to have a ""My Precioussss"" effect.  lol

			Is losing keys (and the consequent costs) part of any standard insurance here? I get confused as insurance seems to work differently here than in the UK.   
Here, you insure yourself against what you might do to other people's stuff, rather than your own. And it seems a landlord expects one to insure against things (eg neighbour's burst pipe; contradicting the above statement I know ) that in the UK would be their responsibility.

			Hello,   
I was wondering, which would be the cheapest service in case I want to sent a package of clothes, weighing about 20 kilos from Switzerland to India.   
The first name that comes to my mind is LA POST / DIE POST, however, I will need to do the packing, which might not be a huge amount of work I guess, some strong card boards and duck tape.   
Or would it be one of those private movers, which I highly doubt would be a like DILARA who could sent it cheaper, in case I do my packing.   
Anybody with any sort of experience in this area, would be helpful.   
Cheers

I have used Migros' developing service (which was fine) but they seem to only offer 35mm. I also shoot on medium format film (6x6) and was hoping to find a lab to develop that too.

			If all else fails, why not just bundle all the ""kinderlis"" in warm clothes, take them off to the woods and let them do the party themselves. 
Make plenty of bread dough, bringplenty of ""Cervelat"", make a bonfire, get them to collect some good straight cooking sticks, and make ""Twisties""- make a sausage like roll of the dough, wind it round the stick and let the child cook his/her own Twistie.  
Similar principal with the Cervelat, carve a few decorations on it, if you have the time and the inclination, or just skin it and bung it on the stick and let each child cook his/her own Cervelat. 
Jam and/or butter to go with the Twisties, mustard and/or tomato sauce to go with the Cervelat.   
Then get them to sing happy birthday at the top of their voices, when you bring out a candled cake.   
Have a good time whatever you do.

I do not have to be proficient in French for this program, as confirmed by the University.   
The commute is a worry, and I was hoping to gather all my classes into 2-3 days a week. It's all a concern.    
I just really want to finish my degree, and I am fine with starting over if they don't take my credits. Now that I am here, I have the time and it's something I'm wanting to look into.   
I guess it's best just to visit with them and see if any of my hopes are a possibility.

			Hi all, 
Thanks again for your comments and information. 
Yes, I have done searches on Heerbrugg, but I like to get information from people that live there, or have lived there, so I get a more personal vew of a place. 
As for taking a job away from people living in an area, well, I have not been offered the job, yet, still early stages. Though, if a company is going outside an area to find people, then it is obvious that qualified people are not easy to find within that area. I onced asked my hiring manager, when I was offered a job in Bad Saltzdetfurth Germany, why did they not find someone locally, or even within Germany (I was living in Liverpool at the time). I was told that there were no experienced design engineers with my skills and background in the area, and those that they were able to find were not interested in moving to Bad Saltzdetfurth. 
I've reasearched the company, but, again, getting personal information from people about a company is helpful. I've worked for companies that looked good on their website only to find out that they were crap. 
Right now there seems to be an explosion of technical jobs openning up in Europe. Here in the UK I've been contacted about 5 contract mechanical engineering jobs in the last week. This tells me that there is a lot going on. Search Jobsite.co.uk and you'll see for yourself. 
So, if your out of work, you might want to consider relocating, at least for a while. Or, maybe for a long run. If you don't have the skills, maybe consider getting training, or going back to college/university. 
So far in this recession I've been lucky to keep working, even fortunate to change contract jobs for more money. This only tells me if you are willing to move and take on challenges outside your comfort zone, then you'll stay in employment. 
Anyway, thanks a lot all for your replies and very helpful information. 
The next step is to get through the interviews and decide if Heerbrugg will be my last and final stop in my working career (making Heerbrugg my final home before I die).

			Yes she does count. I have called the Geneva border control to confirm as I was travelling with my children.   
As you would expect though and as already pointed above, cigarettes and alcohol allowances are for adults only.   
A passing comment: i have found the swiss customs were relative more tolerant than I had first thought with the allowances... I stopped the other day to declare the winter tyres and the groceries I had bought. The tyres were over the 300CHF limit, so I had to pay the swiss VAT on it and then I had for about 270 euros of groceries shopping (worth slightly more than the 300CHF limit) but given I had treated my son to a free trip to Mulhouse, the customs official was happy to let me go without paying more VAT as my son's allowance covered it.   
Also it seems that if you actually have something to declare when you go through the border, they are less suspicious... Coming back from the Christmas holidays in france, we had the car full of new gifts + some clothes we had bought. Arriving at the border the guard asked whether we had something to declare and we said yes. He asked us to park and to go to the office, and then happily moved on to the next car. I parked the car and I went in with my little bag of clothes worth 240 euros... (i.e 299 CHF) and the guy there stamped my form so I could claim my french VAT back and there was no nasty question...   
Moral: going forward, I will always have something to declare when I cross the border. no more stress...

I'm not sure if you can find them in the spring, however. You might try a specialist garden center like Tann-Ruti  ( ) and see if they can be ordered this time of year.   
Fritillaria can also be ordered online from Samen-Mauser but they are listed as 'Herbstzweibeln', meaning autumn bulbs. Wouldn't hurt to ask if any are available now, though.

In some cases, people can take offence if this protocol is ignored.

Laser hair removal is based on a very basic physical principle that dark things absorb light and light things do not. If you have pale skin and dark hair, a strong pulse of laser light will be absorbed by the hair and not the skin surrounding it: so in layman's terms, the hair will get fried and the skin will escape relatively unscathed. After a few rounds of this treatment the hair follicles (i.e. roots) become so damaged that hair won't grow anymore. But it does take a few rounds of treatment to damage the follicle enough so that your hair won't regrow, so results are definitely not immediate with one treatment, although they can be permanent and irreversible given enough rounds of laser hair removal treatment. (Although it is not guaranteed.)   
With light hair and light skin, or dark hair and dark skin, there is no differential absorption of light, i.e. everything gets evenly toasted and hair will continue to grow from the follicle as normal as blasting your skin with a laser doesn't confer any significant amount of damage to the root.   
It's certainly an effective technique when used on a certain type of of person with the right skin/hair type combination, but even if I had dark hair and light skin (as opposed to my very-fair-hair and so-pale-it's-practically-translucent skin) I'd certainly not try it at home due to the risk of burns.

It's surprisingly safe too- I bleed far less than I ever did using normal safety razors. Nick myself maybe once a year, almost always when in a rush just after waking up.

In terms of the passport you now have to go to Paris, they will not issue British passports in Switzerland. You used to be able to do it here but not any more. Rather than doing that I am simply going to stay in the UK until my new one arrives.

			Just wondering if anyone has had any experience with the company GfK Switzerland.    
They originally phoned asking if I wanted to participate in a radio survey. I answered their questions regarding my radio listening habits, interests, hobbies, etc. They sent me a letter in the mail explaining how the week long survey works. You are supposed to wear a watch for a week and return it afterwards. The letter explained how they don't listen to my speech but rather use a special currency to see how long I listen to radio and what stations, etc. They called me again and asked me even more questions and told me I would receive the survey watch on the 10th or the 15th. I haven't received anything or heard anything back from them. The prize for this 1 week participation is supposed to be a Swatch watch. Seems a little sketchy to me and we were wondering why they never carried through with sending me the watch and if maybe this survey week is a front for something else. Any ideas?

			Ok, I will be direct (and I could not care less if that attracts some groans from unimportant people...)   
I would expect that no school ever asks for a motivation letter for a master in computer science or any of the engineering directions... it is pretty clear why one would continue his technical education.   
Psychology is on the other hand one of the subjects in Zurich many of the girls study, who basically plan to go seamlessly from student to trophy wife of a banker. No university wants those students.   
The motivation letter is a small barrier, but it possibly makes you sit down and think about it: Why do you want to go to school for two more years exactly? When I went to school, I did so for very clear and direct reasons. Writing a motivation letter would have been a matter of maybe 30 minutes with another 30 minutes correcting grammar and spelling    
A CV is even less work. So frankly: If you do not feel like writing a motivation letter, you are probably trying to avoid thinking about your motivation... if you really have doubts weather to apply for it because of so a small barrier, probably don't apply before you really know what you want.   
Anyway, how would I structure my motivation letter?  
1.) Explain why you want to do a masters in psychology. This is really your personal motivation. 
1.1) Why do you need a master? What will it enable you to do you cannot do now already with your undergraduate degree? 
1.2) Why Psychology? Do you plan to do a specialization? Some of the personal past stuff goes into here...   
2.) Why at this school? Show that you did your homework and looked up what they offer... and explain that this is exactly what you wanted to study...    
Easy.

			My brother is keen on having a go at skiing (he lives in the UK), but suffers from large feet.  In particular, his feet are larger than the usual range of sizes commonly available from shoe shops, and I presume, ski boot hire companies.  Does anybody know of a place either in the Zürich area, or at a ski resort (with slopes appropriate for a beginner) where he might be able to hire large sized boots?  His normal shoe size is something like a UK 14 or 15 (I can't remember off the top of my head) which I guess is a European 48-50.  Given that he's never tried skiing before, I expect he'd rather not buy until he's established whether he likes it or not.

			Hi chist_sev,   
I've seen you were asking for used winter clothes for your children.    
You may contact: Mission ohne Grenzen, Christliches Hilfswerk für Osteuropa, Marburgerstr. 30, 35216 Biedenkopf   
They provide winter aid to families in the Ukraine, and might help you or give advice where to find other charities in the Ukraine.

			Yup, my friend too.   He's convinced that the French are actively grateful for all those extra recyclable materials, provided at no charge by a horde of hoarders from just over the border.    Creck, on both accounts. There is no deposit on bottles or PET bottles in Switzerland. If there were, the drinks would look expensive, and that wouldn't be very Swiss, now would it?   
You do pay a deposit in Germany, so if you want it refunded, you need to take your bottles back to the supermarket. If you could be bothered storing them in the corner of your 2 sq m kichen for a few weeks until a refundable mountain develops.

			I'd suggest looking north   Thomann (in Germany) have some cheap ones, starting at around 89 EUR for a starter set including case, bow, shoulder support.. I think this would be ideal for a beginning student. I've ordered instruments and equipment from this company, and I can recommend them.  ( ).    
You might also check out some violin shops (sorry, don't know any in Zürich.. Geigenbauer Koch is a great one in Luzern..) and ask if they have any 'occasion' instruments, ie. pre-loved, 2nd hand, consignment etc. I'm not sure about violins, but for guitars, they usually start at around 300-400 CHF for a student model (to give you an idea of costs).    
Sometimes you might find a guitar or violin hanging around in a 2nd hand furniture/bric-a-brac shop.. however I'd steer clear of them as they tend to be shoddy instruments and overpriced! (and if the shop owner offers to repair the instrument himself, run!!)

			Dear all   
I've just moved to Geneva and, to my horror, the removal men have damaged my dining table. They didn't secure my bike properly which then scratched the table completely and took a small chunk out of the side during the journey. Luckily they are insured. I need to find someone who can repair the table and restore it, hopefully to its original finish.    
Can anyone recommend someone or a company who can repair wooden furniture like this? Need to find someone asap as the clock is ticking on the insurance claim.   
Thanks for all your help

			I think there is a huge demand for marketers with a background in liberal arts. Since you have no background in anything useful for private business, you will be far less biased when you do the marketing... you know, I have a somewhat technical background and it really holds me back to write the complete bullshit other marketers produce. You would not have this disadvantage.

			The important thing is to get to do something that is at least a bit interesting. I was an aviation fanatic and got to join the air force as a radio operator. Spending time on mountain airbases and getting my fix of jet fuel fumes on a daily basis made it bearable. Bearable enough that I ended up doing 900 days of service and being discharged as a captain. There were some tough days but on the whole I will remember the fact that I got to see parts of Switzerland that I would otherwise never have seen, that I saw more beautiful sunrises than I can count on two hands, that I met some really interesting people (and some of my very best friends), that I did stuff that I would never have thought myself capable of doing. I was glad when I was done, but I never regretted having done it.

			Dear EF users,   
I've encountered a problem with a private gym owner, who is refusing to reimburse or transfer to a freind the half-used abo, which I cannot use anymore due to medical condition.    
Moreover, to a certain extent this medical condition is caused by the gym instructor, who allowed me to go on the machines despite my expressed concerns abt pains in my ankle, that later turned out to be bone fracture. I didn't press any charges back at the time, having bigger things to worry about, such as the summer spent on crutches.    
Do I now have the right to claim the value of the abo, since there's no way I am going to risk going onto those machines (Power Plate) for at least another year? And if so, how do I do that legally? Is there some sort of consumers' rights protection facility in German speaking Switzerland?    
And for having to go through all these troubles, I am now prepared to cause him some, as to report the unsatisfactory sanitary conditions of the gym - he's got a dog living and eating there, food crumbs and dog hairs all over the place. Is there some public health agency that would be in charge of this? Licensing authority, etc?   
Thanks for your feeedback!

			A Uk based skiiers website called welove2ski.com have asked me to see if there are any aspiring bloggers out in Flims/Laax region who would like to contribute on a daily or weekly basis for the 2010/2011 season about current snow conditions, weather and resort info as well as anything else of interest around the resorts.   
It would be helpful if you are a keen skiier , or maybe a boarder (curse you   )   
If you reside or even visit these resorts on a regular basis, have a bit of spare time and you would like to share your thoughts with the rest of the UK and others then PM me and I will send you the contact details.   
I would like to point out that I am in no way affiliated to the site, I was only asked as I keep updating the site about the Zurich area but they have no one covering the Flims/ Laax resorts at the moment.   
Cheers

			Why not buy a new bag and claim for that?  I did that a few years ago.   
Or else, try the Migros.  But they will only charge about 30 or 50 francs.  Or perhaps a place that repairs shoes.

			I had someone from this company repair a sofa for me last week. He stitched the seam at my home and did a brilliant job. The repair was arranged through Möbel Pfister as the sofa is under guarantee.   
The first thing he did was ask if he should take his shoes off.    
The person who came to my home spoke English. If you send me a PM I will give you his name. I am not sure all the repair staff do.    
Here is the company information:

Suggested initial shopping list:   
Ski jacket  
Salopettes / Boarding trousers 
Woolly hat 
Gloves / Mitts 
Firm-knit ski socks (strongly advise against loopstitch) 
Long-sleeved highneck Tshirts 
Longjohns for those especially nipply mornings  
Sunglasses good enough for snow conditions    
(virtually all reusable even if you decide that skiing's not for you   )

Sada, since you are one of my heroes, I want to know what you meant by ""I have found what works for me"".  Is it the mixed martial arts or is it other forms of relaxation and/or release?

			I have been teaching a doctoral course at Swiss Management Centre since 2007 and there can be no finer on-line learning experience than the one they offer. It has been my privilege to work with adults who display amazing self -direction and discipline, read  and complete very challenging assignments on time and with enough sophistication to rival what your ""accredited"" institutions can can offer.     
Learning is about personal motivation to acquire knowledge,skills and changed attitudes and transfer these to work environments for effectiveness. I don't see what accreditation got to do with this. Anyone who successfully completes an on-line advanced learning programme is definitely the stuff of leadership and management

The rental agreement was due to start as of the 1st of November not 1st October. 
There are no conditions at all (not even in 'mice print') on the application form. 
There is a charge of CHF 280 for having to re-list the apartment on the internet, the apartment in question wasn't even listed on the internet, I went to see another aprtment in the same building and the agency guy told me about the apartment in question and that it would be available on 1st November. 
The charge of CHF 300 for 'communications' is also a bit offsides, that's all they did was send out a contract.

			I would like to install a washer and dryer in my apartment (can no longer succumb to the once a week schedule with a 2 year old who I am constantly changing!)   
My apartment, however, is currently not set up for a washer and dryer, so I will need an electrician/sanitär who can install them for me (got the landlord's approval).     
Can anyone recommend someone who would travel to the Zürich area who could do this for me?  How much can I expect to spend?  (No need for a fancy washer/dryer, just a mid-size range machine, no frills).     
I did get one offer, but the company (who would be doing the installation) requires me to also buy the machines through them.  It seems more expensive than if I went out and bought them myself at say MediaMarkt.  Also, the guaranty on the machines is two years, which I thought seemed short, but maybe that is typical?  Not sure.   
Thanks for the tips!

			I have no idea about Ochsner- they might be very good. But I trust very few people to service my board or skis. Many larger shops idea of servicing or repairing is to just put skis on a machine and shave off until the surface is smooth. After a few such treatments, your sole and edges become very thin and weak. This happened to my last skis- caught a couple of stones and went to the shop to repair - looked great when I picked them up. What I didn't realise was that instead of doing a proper repair, (ptex or similar) - they had just shaved down to smooth surface. When I took them for service to my trusted friend at the sports shop here - he told me there was practically nothing left.  If you take skis for stone damage to edges or sole - insist that they repair properly! GRRRRRR.

			My suggestion would be for you to visit the Botanical Gardens.     
There are other complicating factors in selecting plants here (i.e. Plants grow differently here than at the country of the posters origin).   
If you go to the gardens you will see a large variety of trees that are well suited to this climate, they are usually labelled so you can take the name of the tree you like.    
If possible, the staff maybe able to help you out with a bit more info as well.     
As for a fast growing low maitenance flowering bird attracting tree..... good luck.     
First thing is that you should keep the expected height of the tree in mind.

			Hi, I'm italian, just moved to Commugny and I am desperate to find a dentist. I've just finished my treatment in London, where I used to live and now I'm in pain again not because of my dentist, he is very good but because I have a lot of problems. I need to take off a tooth which has a crown and its attached to another tooth. The problem is I won't be able to go to London now because I have to work. 
Dentists here are too expensive and I agree with Uri, some are too old and don't use modern technology. I also need someone who can let me pay monthly...I know, I'm dreaming. Anyway, if someone knows a good dentist, maybe in France, close to Commugny, please, let me know. Thanks.

			I don't know about courses, but the best advice I ever got was from my first photo mentor: learn to shoot without a meter. I spent a lot of time learning meterless; going by the little exposure guide in the film packaging, keeping notes. After I was confident I went straight for a handheld spot meter, and would estimate exposures by eye and see how well I did. This was essentially Zone Method stuff. Once your eye is trained you can correct exposures that would be otherwise off using in-camera metering. It's also a fun party trick with other photographers who don't believe it's possible  . And if you use vintage stuff (all my stuff is mid 60's or older), you can grab shots you'd otherwise lose fumbling for the meter. I remember reading that a few of Ansel Adams' published shots were done on the fly with eyeballed exposure.

			Thanks, Longbyt.    
I have known about recalls for a while, since I have been watching over some parenting boards, Haba has had quite a few problems over small parts and kids who ate/inhale little bits. I remember cca 2-3 years ago a big scandal over Haba toys back home and in the US and CA, a dozens of items were recalled and I still see the toys sold here every now and then. I asked about this recall here when it first made the news abroad but the shop assistants just rolled their eyes  .       The Haba recall was giant. I just mass emailed my mom friends when it made the news back then, I posted here as well if I remember well, it's a pity since their toys are so cute. Some more info   and  .    
Another company we personally had a bad experience was Eichhorn, the wooden blocks chipped so much at one point our kid was just playing with splinters (we had 3 different wooden puzzles and blocks) and while we are at it, Bimbosan soft feeding spoon that had the logo printed on the handle that our child basically licked away. I am not sure of the safety and tests, if there are obligatory warnings and recalls here centralized as it normally is in other countries, but it makes one worry a tad seeing toys on the market that are banned elsewhere (and very pricey on top of that).

Morning glories = ipomée 
Jasmine = jasmin 
Clematis = clématite 
Anemones =anémone 
Corn flowers = bleuet 
Petunias = pétunia 
Geranium = géranium   
I buy seeds from the Co-op or Migros (morning glories and corn flowers), and the more developed plants from Hornbach in Etoy. I've also bought from Obi in Renens, but I find their plants are less healthy and sometimes the selection is poor. The top-of-the-line is Schilliger Garden Center in Gland: they have an amazing selection of both indoor and outdoor plants. It's more pricey, but you won't go home empty-handed. In this shop especially, if there is something else your hankering after but don't know the name, take a picture from a gardening magazine and bring it to the shop. The service is good.   
Finally, a very reliable (in my experience) place to order from online is

			There's also a sort of charity shop run by the church opposite the Denner next to the train station. It has a bit of everything (furniture, bits and pieces for the house) but definitely has a clothes section. I don't have any children, so I didn't really notice what sort of things there were for infants, but it's worth a look.

			As has been said, most desktop computers have a switch to let you change between 120 and 220.  You can either change the cord or get a plug adapter.  For long term use you might as well change the cord.  It is safer and just as easy as using a plug adapter.  Also, it is often possible to change the power supply (the metal box with the plug and switch and so on), so even if you don't have a switch, a sufficiently techy person can probably swap in a better power supply for you.   
For the monitor you will have to read the label.  A reasonable fraction of modern LCDs will accept 120 or 220 without even a switch - just a change of the cord.  If it has an external power supply that only takes 120, you might be able to find a replacement power supply. If it is really hardwired to only take 120, I'd probably leave it, unless it is very high end.  There are 220->120 transformers but the good ones aren't free and any box like that is one more thing to break or catch fire.

Shooo,   are the sellers in Czech. Now I have had mine for decades, so I hope the price is still better there, hopefully. At least you can chose from a number of different styles, try them on, etc. They are popular back home.    
For some other shops,   is decadently good. But you will not want to leave, it's huge...(czech girls are bigger than here, so it will be a better place for nice, cheaper clothes, etc.)   
Now, for books, drinks and fun,   is convenient, I had gigs there and poetry slams, I think there should be always something going on, cafe and food is good there, fab books, everyone speaks English.

			I think they do collect the items from a central depot.  The reason I think they use for it being greener is due to the fact that instead of 6 or 8 customers each driving to the shop, only one van does all the driving.  Although if the central depot is all the way in Zurich and the van has to travel quite far out to make deliveries, then it sounds like its really a much of a muchness.

The abbreviation posted is ""pann. fib. bois perf."" ""panneau fibre bois perforée."" Now I have to cut about 200 pegs to hold the spools.

			i don't know which computer you have but when i was pricing replacement parts for my dell, i found new keyboards being sold in the 10 dollar range on ebay. Dell has detailed instructions on their site how to change it on your own. And finally if you do have a dell and need those little clicky things, i can probably find a few i still have around to give you. In my experience though, once that piece comes out its almost impossible to reattach it.

All depends on how often you want to buy one. If you want a really good one,m get a Laurastar, they are a little expensive but they do save timne and are very reliable.

			I'm very happy with my 100-400L (f/4.5-f/5.6 btw), however the 100-400L has about a 2 stop IS and the new 70-300L has the latest 4 stop IS which is worth a lot. The 70-300L will also have the latest coatings for color, contrast and flare which is also a plus.   
That said, the extra 100mm of the 100-400L makes all the difference for wildlife. On the other hand, the 70-300L should be just right for sport. Of course you can use both with 1.4 and 2x TCs, but that will mean a 1 series body if you want AF.   
...looks like the 70-300L is lighter than the 100-400L, which may be a factor for some folks.

			Can anyone suggest a good place to buy a fire grate or basket?  
I am thinking of a cast iron type of affair, something like this chap:      
I do not want anything too fancy (read 'expensive'), just a functional item to put in the open fire that we have here to allow a proper fire.   
If anyone can help with a translation of what to call one of these in German, I could always have a look on Amazon.de etc. I have tried my translation (Gusseisen Feuerkorb) but I seem to end up with round garden fire type things.   
Thanks in advance.

			Hola!   
I'm Mahogany from Panama and I live in Zug. I write songs and sing for fun since I was a child.   
I haven't been able to continue since I moved here and would really like to.    
I can sign but I can't play any instrument and was wondering if there is someone who can play the guitar or the piano, or even a band who could help me with some backgrounds for my songs.  I would love to make some videos and share my music with the world, one of my goals before I turn 30.   
My songs are mainly in Spanish  in a pop / rock style and generally about love (yes, we Latinos are über romantic!!)    
Any musicians interested?  You can send me an email to   so we can meet and plan some jam sessions.   
You can listen to some of my songs here:    
Cheers and hope to hear from you soon, 
Maho.

			When I was living in Oerlikon I noticed a girl on the train quite often. She was a petite, pretty brunette in her early 20s. Once getting on the train for HB I was talking on the phone in English and she looked up and smiled a beautiful smile. I was ever so charmed. I walked by her again and to my surprise she was speaking English to some people at the meeting point. I felt like saying hello as I'm an outgoing person but was really late for a meeting (as usual).   
Never miss a chance to talk to someone.

			It took me over a month to get a replacement charger for my Macbook Pro. YMMV. The Swiss seem to have this attitude of 'it gets here when it gets here' and their suppliers seem to take advantage of this and place them on the low end of the supply chain.

			When family and friends come to visit we usually take first-timers on a short walking tour of bits of the city (mostly the middle bits) pointing out anything of interest/history that we have learned here and there.  We know there is a real walking tour available, and we will probably start taking advantage of that at some point.  But some of our visitors ask if there is a book about the history of Zürich available.  So, erm, is there a book about the history of Zürich available?  They're english speakers so that's their language preference, but we wouldn't mind picking one up in german for ourselves.   
I'll be heading off to the bookstores to do some sluething this weekend, but I thought posting here might unearth a useful clue or two.

			stofftrucke at Sihlstrasse tram stop - Urainiastrasse - it' on the second floor of the round building across from the tram stop, you have to walk through the dress shop and up the stairs (there is a lift for prams in the back of the shop)...   
Also, you could try Leibendgut, near Rennweg.     
And the Bernina shop at Talacker 35.     
The prices will make your eyes water, and the selection is not that large, but it's a start...   
Hey, maybe I should do a 'sewing' tour - I already do two other shopping tours - brockenhaus and 'foods of the world'...

			my knowledge of the uk is something like:   
start uni @ 19 
do a 3 years degree and graduate @ 22 
if you do a masters, graduate @ 23   
i know in germany it is quite common to fail some years and so takes longer.   
if i understand correctly then, in switzerland:   
start uni @ 20 
do a degree and graduate @ 24 
if you do a masters, graduate @ 26   
so a 'normal' person starts a year later, normally takes 4 years to do degree bit and 2 years for the masters bit.   
does that sound right?

Somebody posted a linklist on the other thread you opened.   
Just a quick info: Most public schools are basically free here, meaning that 400-600 CHF of ""admission fee"" are basically all you pay for the whole semester (plus books etc.).   
There is a big difference between Switzerland and the US. Here public Universities (the 400-600 CHF ones) are on average good to very good. The much more expensive private ones vary wildely in quality (some good ones of course, but caveat emptor is de rigeur).   
As the posters in the other thread suggested: learning german will vastly improve your chances of getting a good degree at a reasonable price.

			Hi there. 
Think you got the wrong end of the stick. 
I said in the next thread that oops sorry I had meant to put that one I wrote in a reply to an older set if posts in which a few different people had asked one another how to get into fashion/design and course available here. 
This was two years ago so as I only saw it now and only just moved here I asked 'how they all got on with their courses"", not sure if you are English but this means how did it all go ..? 
Anyway I was just enquiring myself and as I said I am pursuing human rights which I am qualified in but also had designed some garments and had them made and sold some in Syndey a few years back.. so just wondered if there was a short course as in evenings etc or part time which I could do alongside the other stuff! 
Ambitious I know but hey you only get one life! 
I love sketching, designing and have been told I have designed some very good garments but can't sew very well!

			Another success story with Potz. It does the job on regular blockage.    
If you've inherited a flat where the last tenant used the drain to dispose of cigarette butts, cooking grease or... whatever, you'll need something stronger - like the products locked up in the pharmacy. The strong stuff is a bit scary and can create mini-geysers, so be careful if you use it. Wear glasses or something to protect your eyes, rubber gloves, and stay well away from the drain.

			unless you are using a fine art printer, to do something like giclee prints 3000 dpi is already too much.   
As a matter of fact most top of the line art printers will rarely ever go over 600-1200 dpi.   
Now as mentionned before if you are not fully knowledgable or do not have proper help or training to operate the Nikon scanner the odds are you will not get optimal results.   
Having personally worked in pre-press a few years back in the wide format industry I am fully versed in resolutions, quality, vectorial versus bitmap etc. 
Yet with my knowledge I still wouldn't ever consider doing 35mm scans myself for an exhibit unless I could really control/review the whole chain from scan to printout.     
You still never mentionned   and   you expect them to be.    along the line if the printouts don't correspond to what you want(some printers will have an extra tint of blue, or red or green.... depending on the printer obviously and these things need to be corrected if you want the best of the best).   
If the print is outsourced you will be required to deliver 300-600 dpi images. Some places may not ask for specific resolutions but your image will have it's effective resolution lowered at one stage in the production process.   
The extra Dpi from the scanner is just an excess of information that will be of no help unless you plan on going for larger formats which require heavy duty interpolation of the image with specific software like Genuine Fractals.

Quite perturbed as I never subscribed to Swiss News--though I was given a few months of it as a replacement when Inside went under. Now it looks as though Swiss News are automatically reupping those Inside subscribers. Not_happy.

			I often hear how difficult it is to meet other women when you move here without young children and don't have the chance to meet other moms through school. Husbands go off to work, and stay-at-home wife/partner is lonely.    
The young mums in the area have various playgroups, many have made initial contact through EF or the Yahoo Group Expats Baden. To be honest, most moms are very busy and not wondering what to do in their free time but asking themselves when they will have any free time .   
The English Speaking Club in Baden/Brugg organizes events.

			Hello,   
  I live in Schaffhausen, and I really want to learn how to dance. I am really not very coordinated when it comes to dancing, so I do not really do it. I guess I have 2 left feet, haha!   
  I do not really want to do group lessons, at least not at first, I am very shy when it comes to groups, especially something I have zero confidence in.   
  I would really love to learn how to dance, I am not sure if their is a specific type of dance I should try to learn. or what, but I figure I need to start somewhere....   
  IF anyone has recommendations or helpful suggestions on where to go - Zurich area or within reasonable travel time by train would be best..   
 Thank You,

My son has invited an extra person along to his party tomorrow and now we don't have enough seats in the car. Does anyone have a spare seat I could borrow just for tomorrow to ferry the boys around. I need a back seat for the left hand side of the car. I think the Seat version of the Sharan has the same seats also, and perhaps the Ford Galaxy. Anyone near me have one they could lend me?  
Would be brill if someone could help us out.   
Thanks   
catherine in Adliswil   
PS I've tried my local dealer, they usually lend out spares, but they've only got a seat for the right side  
PPS  They are big boys, so won't make a mess. Seat will be well looked after

			Hi there...I dont want to mention the word hair dresser/beauty salon enquiry in fear thru boredom there will be no response....however I must enquire as none of the previous responses seem to include Luzern or in the near vacinity...so does any one know of a good hair dresser/beauty salon i.e waxing...further to that what social life is happening in Luzern for ozzies, I dont really want to travel to Zurich or beyond due to family committments. 
Many thanks if some info could be provided.

			Hi all,   
first post after my introduction! So, I am sorry to ask for tips and help before even contributing to the site, but my boyfriend and I have decided to move to Schaffhausen (from Geneva where we currently live), and as I have been here for over 6 years ... I forgot all about what to do when relocating.   
Anyone has good tips or a check list of what needs to be done? This is what I haven't been able to work out so far:   
- Find a relocation company that would move furniture across the country without charging an arm and a leg - any help?   
-What are the official forms to fill? I know I have to register in the new canton once I arrive, but do I have to do anything in Geneva before I leave?   
-Health insurance - do I have to declare anywhere that I am moving to Schaffhausen?   
-Car: My car currently has a Geneva licence plate, do I have to register it in Schaffhausen? when?    
Anything else that I am missing??    
Also, even thou I have been to Schaffhausen quite often, I have only ever been there during the weekend. Does anyone have an idea on how easy/complicated it is to ""adapt and integrate"" while speaking very very little german?   
Any suggestion for what a mainly-english-speaker can do there during the week? (aka which one's a good gym? is there an english book club? Where can I get german lessons that won't cost me too much?)   
I know that those are a LOT of questions, but I thought better ask all at once   .    
Thanks in advance to anyone that can help!

			One reason that ordinary sport shoes aren't used is that often the  shoes stay at school or in the music room and don't come home. Therefore it makes sense to only pay circa CHF7 at Migros for some rather than CHF30+ for sport shoes which only get worn once per week.

			I see that the stack exchange site has a proposal for an expatriates website.   
You can find more information here, and 'follow' it i.e. help get it proposed.     
To understand the concept of how stack exchange sites work, think of it as a cross between a forum (like this), wikipedia, digg/reddit and blogs   
People can tag questions, comment on them and also up and downvote both questions and answers. What is especially good is that useful answers bubble up to the top of the thread rather than having to wade through lots of pointless responses with either: stupid comments on the naievity of the questioners, or general misinformation. As with this forum, those with the right sort of knowledge gain reputation points. However, downvoting other topics results in your own reputation being reduced.   
The technical versions of this website (things like stackoverflow.com) have been so successful that now they are starting up a whole bunch of new sites covering every topic you could possibly imagine.

			Thank you Summerrain! Unfortunately the OH has ruled out the foot/baseboard type    
Hi Swisspea, this is what I was thinking of but will have to look into how to raise it up off the floor and if they have a double. Good place to start though! Thanks! 
The Vanvik I can see getting dirty quickly but I am sure I can find a valance to place over it and protect it. This is definately an option. I had previously discounted it but am rethinking it. The Grimen has me a little concerned but deserves a look when I get to Ikea!   
As for Uncle Bertrand's recommendation......mmmm.....definately no corner danger!

			Stillkissen you can get in most baby shops - including the Manor baby section and Babys R Us at Toys R Us. Schwangershchaftskissen - as in the specially shaped bump-pillow type - not (at least not that I've seen).   
But, you can get them online at   (actually search for schwangerschaftskissen). They also have all types of breastfeeding cushions (stillkissen).   
But it depends on why you want one / what your problem is - if you have pain in the groin area then I'd recommend a stillkissen (long breastfeeding cushion) tucked around the bump and between your legs. If you have back pain then probably the bump pillow is better. If you're just generally uncomfortable then I'd say try something with a regular pillow first - either tuck it between your legs, tuck it under the bump or both - can help and is cheaper than a special pillow.   
But I have to say that the long style stillkissen is rubbish for actual breastfeeding - if you want a cushion for BFing then I'd go for one of these C shaped ones - much better!

I wouldn't do it myself as it gives the appearance of 120V sockets, which really aren't. Where possible, replace the plugs with Swiss ones.

			I Have (almost) decided to buy   and a matching rack from Topeak but I can not find out where to shop.   
Do you know of any good Swiss/non-swiss internet shops?   
I don't have the energy to visit physical stores, as most of them don't have these products.   
I know of chainreactioncycles.com, bikester.ch, velomarkt.ch   
To much hazzle (read: tax, VAT, fees etc.) from UK and the bag seems to be a old/different model on bikester.ch.   
Suggestions are welcome.

1. Depends on who/how many you're up against. Nobody but ETH can answer that, and if you ask them outside of admissions times, they should be happy to give you an answer for pre-requisites (I don't know for sure, but that's what I did with HSG). Aside from that, I believe the ETH uses a mentor type system, so you'll have to get one of the 30 professors to agree to take you on. 
2. as an international, 0% in your first semester, and up to 25% after that once you've proved hardship and that you've exhausted all other sources... so, not easy. then there are the other programs that have already been mentioned. Keep in mind that as you won't have a permanent  permit, you will be ineligible for most funding programs. 
3. Extremely likely. English is usually the only language requirement for graduate programs. 
4. according to ETH, CHF 634/month. 
5. you'll be in the city, in a very international area - and as I'm sure you know, the sciences tend to be very international... who cares what the farmers think? 
6. yes   
Short of No. 5, and maybe 1, these were all found within a two minute maximum search of the ETH site.    
I'm sorry, but if you want to attend one of the most highly regarded tech institutions and have them pay for it while you're at it, you've really got to step up your game.

For me, I am learning German and it's extremely difficult for Vietnamese like me to study but it's pretty fun for pronunciation anyway!

			As far as I know, you can start your PhD when you want (=when funds become available in most cases haha). I am starting Sept 1st, which was probably a bad idea because of all the other students, but some person in our group started in April and we are expecting two girls some time in September or October, they are not even sure when. To be 100% honest, if I had had the choice of a program elsewhere, similar to the one I will be doing here, but with reasonable accomodation arranged, I would have never chosen this! Alas, I had nothing else that I liked    
But it should work out for you if you want a flat share    
And I also found myself wishing there was a student subforum in this forum! I've lived a ""student life"" for most of my adult life, I have no idea about things like insurance, contracts, bills etc that I'm sure are common knowledge for ""real people"".

			Im a industrial designer and have worked for a few well established/successful company's in Switzerland and germany, now im going self employed, there is no cash in design as a employee,it is sick what they pay. But it is a extremely fun and diverse job. Interface design one day, train design the next. Plus there are 1000 people outside the door waiting for your seat. Cut throat industry!   
 Web design is a bread and butter market, along side 3D industrial design.    
To be honest I have on idea, just the design and interface side is easy, as far as i know the ideal course would  be a mix, Flash, CMS and a website builder like dreamweaver.    
If YOU had a to choice,   Or what are the basic skills for website design to take on a professional project?.. (apart from experience  )   
Cheers  profis

Yes - I did attend a class at the ViewFinder Centre once about ... 1.5 years ago if not two ( ). It was a beginner class. My opinion about it - for this particular class if you struggle with understanding DSLR, the aperture, shutter speed etc from reading it's worth attending. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth the money. What you get there (again in this ""intro"" class) is not more than what you find on the internet.    
The fee, is ... yes. not cheap I have to say. They do however these days organise evening classes at cheaper price (shorten duration of course) in Zurich.    
For other subjects ... studio photography, portrait etc. I've not attended any, so I can tell my opinion.    
May be it's worth trying.

add   to the list     
these are more hands on schools specializing in object design, graphic design, art but they may have theory courses 
Lausanne  
Geneva   (look at the hesge circuit, there may be something in there closer to what you are interested in)   
I tried to get into Lausanne back in 2003 and miserably failed. I know people who have been there and love the school. 
The head school in Geneva is also top level, consider both of these schools as being in competition with each other.  
Worked on a project with someone who teaches in Geneva and he was lovely. The profs from both of these schools are amazing

Thanks for your quick response on this thread.    
I just realised my mistake the camera is Sony DSC-W300 with 13.6 MP instead of DSC-W310 mentioned above.   
The cost is still around 370 CHF which is bit more. I am now thinking to check in india if I can get it repaired.

A Visit From Voltaire, by Dinah Lee Küng         
And a classic, 'I'm Not Stiller', by Max Frisch       
(Practically anything by Max Frisch is worth reading)   
And, my guilty pleasure is crime/noir novels... in addition to Dürenmatt, Friedrich Glauser is a fun read, if rather... um... odd.

			The main attraction of fireworks and entertainment on the Rhine is on the evening of 31st of July. The actual Swiss National Day celebration for the city of Basel is held on the First of August in the park in Bruderholz (by the Wasserturm). Huge Bonfire, entertainment and also a big fireworks display (I think at 22:15). Both are definitely worth attending.

			Could anyone recommend a grad school in Switzerland that is relatively easy to get in?  My cousin would like to do his masters in Switzerland (in Engineering), but he did his bachelor's 10 years ago (in the US) and has lost contact with his professors, and therefore is not able to obtain any recommendation letters (required by most grad schools).   
Thanks.

The first degree in a civil-law country will be a ""licence en droit"". Depending whether there is a numeris clausus or not, many or most of the students may drop out before graduating. The best will go on for a Maîtrise and the best of those for a Doctorat en droit.   
It is possible to be admitted to the Bar of some US states (the ABA Web site should have a list) with such a degree, but most often candidates seek an LLM in the best US law school they can get into, both to validate the civil-law degree and to get experience in common-law legal theory, research and practice.   
Of course if you are seeking the degree ""à titre scientifique"", or to get work with an international organisation, that may not matter.   
Transferring law schools is possible, even in the USA (I know someone who left Harvard Law and finished his studies at NYU). There is little point in doing so in a small European country. And with some exceptions the change in legal systems would mean you'd have to repeat year(s).   
Feel free to DM me with any questions.

			My whole system (save for a little underwater camera) is Canon, so obviously that is what I would recommend.  I'd say look at the available lenses, decide which high end (L series for canon) lens you want (based on what you will shoot and what your shooting style is) to start with and go from there.  Many lenses are quite similar between Nikon and Canon with a big exception being the high end macro lens from Canon, which is not offered by Nikon at all.   
I like IS on longer lenses, but on a mid length lens I'd rather have a fast lens than one with IS.  Ideally you'd have a fast lens that also has IS - best of both.  Cameras these days are able to preform remarkably well in lower light at high iso, so really the most important part of the decision is the quality of the glass and the focal length.   
If you go with a full frame camera, remember that it will not have a built in flash and it will indeed be larger.  I use mine (5DmkII) only for work, mostly in the studio.   
The crop sensor cameras will have a built in flash and will be a little bit to a lot smaller depending on which model you choose.   
Some of dSLRs also offer video now, which is pretty cool.  Unfortunately I don't have it on my walk about camera - the one that gets dragged along to school performances, walks on the riverfront, family reunions, etc. It'd be great to have a video option in those events. I have the 50D, but am tempted to upgrade to the 7D this summer.

			I'm afraid it's forever. And for psychology (just as an example) it extends to some European universities too. Sorry to hear you are struggling, have you been able to access exams from the past years or find someone who passed the exam with flying colours to help you? Generally, once they've passed, people will help, even if it is against payment. Also, have you asked to see your exams? You are usually allowed to see them if you failed.

			You will likely need to write a motivation letter and / or essay when applying for a scholarship or some sort of financial aid. Here is   of many many links available where you can brush up your written English for that task.   
As studies in India may be different than from the West, I also suggest for your Masters that you check out the Uni of Hull, UK Student Advice Center podcasts to brush up on critical thinking and writing.   
All the best.

			You could try this place: 'http://www.drumsonly.ch'   
Have no affiliation with them and actually I play guitar not drums. But they're pretty central and I used to jam there, in the basement, with some mates. People can't hear you from the street, so you can take your time improving    
Plus, it used to be about 100 chuffs between 4 of us, for 4 hours of jamming. They used to have a drum kit, bass, 6-string, mixing desk, mics and a keyboard. (Obviously musos with better gear would bring their own stuff too. As did we).   
Might be worth a look-see anyway.

Went to Fust already (the migros store right?) they didnt have any, though it was a smaller one, so maybe a larger one would.      Thanks again.

			Many thanks for that Jim.    
I've already seen this:  . If you replace 'liberal nature' with fascist it makes for better reading.   
The company is paying for the legal advice so we're not being financially raped; I don't, however, want to waste time and line the pockets of a particularly expensive legal prostitute. UK solicitors practicing in Swiss employment law ( after consulting the Law Society and many other sources) seem to be non-existent and I was advised by one that: "" Their (Swiss) prices make a top London firm seem cheap"". The bastards, but I'm not paying.   
In any event her severance/notice period is 6 months so if her boss wakes up one morning and wants shot of her, Ticino and Switzerland will have a very disgruntled Ebeneezer to put up with for the duration.   
Any recommendations for the name of a previously requested legal prostitute/solicitor in Lugano will most welcome.

			You could try Ebay, I got a decent handheld VHF scanner for not a lot of money, came from a guy in UK.   
Desktop planes, depending on how big you want, could try   who also trade on Ebay as well. I've bought 8 so far without complaint. Lots to choose, and price is reasonable. 3-4 week turn around as all are hand carved.

			I had wasps, not bees, and we are homeowners, not tenants.    
If you rent, the property management company should take care of dealing with the wasp nests. This is not something a tenant can be responsible for themselves.    
I am allergic and there is no way I am spraying anything myself. But I have to admit with the inside screen closed I aimed the blow dryer at the small start of a nest on the inside of my Velux roof window. The 4 wasps flew out the window which I then closed.

			Heya    
being that we are moving at the start of august i thought to contact a friend of mine who works at quarantine and luckily enough in the imports department. Ha told me that every container coming in the has one importer ,as in its not a shared container, is being searched. Also according to him , if there is any sort of wood on the inventory the whole container will be treated. There are two methods , either fumigation  where the container is pumped full of some sort of gas ( i have forgotten which one ) or its treated with gamma irradiation.  
Gamma irradiation is limited in the size of things that can be processed ( i enquired with a company used by AQIS for my horse equiptment, Steritech  .com.au)    
We have a quote for our 20 ft container from Schneider Moving Excellence for CHF8,500 door to door meaning that they will pack and unpack for us. Insurance is an extra 2.2% of the value of the goods.    
Hope this helps a little

And I agree that I wouldn't want a third party opening my mail. Not that I have much that some can defraud me of, I still see it very much as a security risk - it only takes one bad apple, and there's always a bad apple.

			Hi All,    
I am desperately trying to get my Wedding Invitations printed and sent out a.s.a.p, but I'm struggling to find somewhere in the Zurich area that does print jobs.    
Does anyone know of a good printing shop that are likely to speak English?   
Many thanks for your help!    
Laurie

			None of these are known brands....and the fact they add ""designer"" in front of their name doesn't change the fact !    
Good furniture is expensive, think between Sfr 600-1'000 for a dining room chair, 10k for a sofa, 4k for a matress,   
Ikea is pretty good too, but you get what you pay for !

If you are going to use you card abroad it is worth advising your bank when you are travelling.  They may block the transactions as suspicious if they are not aware.  I had that happen to me.

			Bizarrely, after reporting that independent repairs store to apple, we paid the 88 francs (half of the 170 they were charging to 'look at it', and the mac is working and charging absolutely fine...   
Haven't even had the need to take it to Apple....absolutely strange! They said they just took it apart and back together again, yet it works... Can't believe they had the nerve to tell us it would be 415 francs and now this has happened!   If I have any more problems I will go straight to Apple tho    
Oh and this isn't Mac related but I've just seen my cat carrying my shoe across the room! We live in strange times....  "	earned the respect of many	Join Date: Feb 2009	Groaned at 10 Times in 7 Posts	Mac Problem - Please help if you can!	falloutchik	Posts: 170

			Hi,   
can anyone recommend (or advise against) a men's tailor in or around Basle? I'm not talking about made-to-measure or the like but somebody who knows his craft (rather than his trade   ).   
I tried the Yellow Pages, but there are quite a lot of results, most or all of which could just as well be alteration seamstresses or ladies' dressmakers, and hardly anyone has a website or even an e-mail address. Finding feedback on the net is even more difficult.

			I was involved for a time in a group called Stop Armut, and basically the idea is to try to cut world poverty in half by the year 2015. I know it seems like a real long shot, but it was pretty cool to be schooled in the ways of the global economic system. What's slightly more expensive, but made by a hard-working farmer in Peru vs. the pair of basketball shoes made in a sweat shop someplace in Bangladesh by a bunch of four year old kids, if you catch my drift. Anyway, we held a few seminars while I was a member, and they pushed Fair Trade stuff really hard. You might give them a try. The website's stoparmut2015.ch I think, and I'm pretty sure it's translated into english. I know there're a few in the Bern group for sure who speak english, and I'll bet they'd love to help you out...

			Hallo! I'm enquiring for a friend, who broke the ceramic glass hob when she dropped a small but hard pepper grinder on it. The heating element is functional, but the crack is right across the hob, and has to be replaced for safety and rental/contratual reasons. She doesn't have Hausratversicherung.   
I've enquired with Electrolux (hob brand) who quoted me the following   My question are, does she have cheaper alternatives locally and in neighbouring locations, and is it possible to procure a used one?   
Any advice and information greatly appreciated!

You wouldn't have believed your eyes if you had seen my wife and I at the airport checking in our bags over the years!! We averaged around 10 32KG. bags every trip home until this last year when Swiss ridiculously jacked up the prices!!   Now we must keep the bags at 23 kg. And because of the two kids, there are 4 bags that we don't need to pay extra for anymore. I now also use the post office International Flat Rate Boxes. 20 lbs. for $40. though it's adds up, it still relives some of the dead weight from the luggage like Boxes of Bisquick and bars of Ivory soap ect...

5657	08.10.2009, 15:56	Senior Member	Thanked 310 Times in 130 Posts	Location: Basel	"    I don't think your fearing discrimination is just a pre-move nerves. There is indeed quite a bit of discrimination going on againt people from Ex-Jugoslawia. For instance, the car insurances ask more money for the car policies and young people find it hard to get into professionnal training. So there is some discrimination and I advise you to take a car policy under your husband's name or to drop your maiden name for the car insurance. When this story about higher car insurances for people from Ex.Jugoslawia, it made quite an uproar, but insurance companies claimed their legal right to do so and the sad thing is, it seems to be true.  
As for work permit, I don't think you'll get discriminate against as it is more the employers, the insurances, the landlords etc who discriminate than the Swiss authorities directly.  
I hope I don't have discouraged you and I wish things weren't as there are , but I see no point in hiding the truth, especially if you might become the victim of them.    
As for your name being a ""tell-away"", I wouldn't be that sure. I wouldn't be able to tell an Eastern Europe name from another (i.e know whether a name comes from Poland, Slovenia, Russia, or Ex-Jugoslawia).

You're very lucky that the cable is still attached. Attaching a new cable to the phone is the difficult bit (I'm speaking from experience). Attaching a plug to the cable is far easier. In fact the cable has only two wires. The plug has four prongs but only two are actually used (can't remember which ones) and once you have identified these, it doesn't actually matter which cable goes where as the phone works either way.

This is a site to which you can order things from sites that only deliver in the US and then they forward the packages to you.   
    ...or maybe someone knows of a better site than myus.com....its just the only one I've heard of, but I have never used it, or any site like it.

			Final update on the topic. I submitted all the paperwork and traceable proof to Amex. They have immediately credited the amount back to my card, but told me that it will take up to 90 days to settle the dispute with the merchant. In case the merchant can prove that I was in the wrong, they will charge the amount to the card again.   
The 90 days have passed now and there they did not charge. A few weeks ago they sent me back all the paperwork I submitted, plus some correspondence they collected while investigating, with a letter that the dispute will be settled in my favour. The vendor has 10 days to appeal, if this doesn't happen then all will be final.   
Thank you all EF-ers for your feedback and contributions!

			In   ""Como agua para chocolate"" is only available in Spanish. Anyway, enter the name of the book in the Search box. At the results, press the button marked ""in den Warenkorb"" next to the one you want. At that point, the site recognised my OS is English and switched to English!   
If you really meant you wanted it in Spanish, get it from amazon.de. It's considerably cheaper there, with free delivery. (Though, oddly, it's under English Books). Amazon.co.uk stock it as well, but it's more expensive.

			I know this thread is quite old but I have a recommendation anyway.   
CASIO PRIVIA PX-500L   
It's a lovely weighted keyboard together with fitted wooden stand. It looks quite professional and a doesn't have hundreds of buttons and flashing led's like traditional home keyboards. Speakers are integral and of high quality.   
Plays beautifully and has keys that illuminate to help you learn the 200 or so built in pieces. It actually has a mode where it waits for you to play the lit notes and then carries on to the next bar.       
Hope this helps.

			Hi, 
I have a US made Gas grill I really like and the only place I can find the couple of parts I need ships only in US. (I've tried all the main DIY stores here etc for a suitable replacement burner)     Masterflame  5000/6000 Series MF1 Bar Burner Assembly - Top ported  Masterflame 2-1/4"" X 17"" stainless burner assembly.  Venturi tube spacing is  3"" center to center and tube reach is 4-3/4"".       5000 Series  Narrow Burner Shield - Drip Vaporiser Bar -    Stainless steel  tent shaped drip vaporiser bar, fits Masterflame 5000 Series gas grills.   19-1/4 inches long x 2-1/2 inches wide.     
I'm looking for a Zürich based EF'er who has a US address where someone could receive them and wouldn't mind sticking them in their suitcase the next time they travel back here. i.e. I would order and pay for the parts and give your US shipping address. It's not urgent. I would collect from you in ZH and give you a small thank you, probably a nice bottle of wine.   
Any takers? Please PM. Thanks.

			Hi there   
You should call into the irish pub opposite the Wiedikon bahnhof. Every thursday they have live irish music. I was in there once and there three people playing and they were very good. Perhaps you could discuss with them directly or ask the bar for contact information.   
Cheers

			I saw this one. My german knowledge is poor, but from this text I understood that if you have a grill that could be placed at least 30cm from the ground, it would not be an issue. Anyway as you said, you must always pay attention on the forbidden signs.

The problem is that for the hot air that's blown outside, the same amount of air (also hot, as it's probably hotter outside :-) will be sucked inside the room again. So while the air conditioner will blow cold air in your face, it will at the same time also suck in hot air. You're probably better off with a fan.   
I did a quick search on the web and found two alternatives - but I don't know if they're any better:   
That one cools with water (but probably raises the humidity in the room - not sure how it works, though):     
And that one:     
the latter has two tubes in order to avoid the difference in pressure that is the culprit for the hot air that's sucked in with normal devices.   
It's also pointless to leave the window open and stick the tube out. When I had to use one of those air-exchanging units a couple of years ago, I went to Obi and had them cut a wooden board the size of the window. I insulated it with styrofoam, cut a hole the size of the exhaust pipe in it and duct-taped it where the window was (just kept that open). That worked semi-decently but looks fugly.

You can also choose your colour as we have have black, brown, fawn and white. Unfortunately we don't have any Alpaca yarn as we don't have time to spin it but I can ask my dad if he has any contacts and can see if there are any French suppliers he knows of.

			Sorry, it's another hairdresser thread, but I couldn't find anything relating to the above area using the search function. My mother is looking for an English-speaking hairdresser (native speaker would be ideal but not absolutely essential) on this side of the lake as she was rather upset when the last hairdresser she went to used a razor on her extremely fine hair despite specifically being asked not to. She will travel as far north as Thalwil and as far south as Pfäffikon or possibly Altendorf. Villages on the plateau (Hirzel, Samstagern, Hütten) would also be possible. Obviously personal recommendations are always best so, does anyone have any recommendations? Many thanks in advance

			Also check your statements each month. Sometimes there is a special offer connected to the keypoints.   
Like one where you got an extra discount off stationery at Manor, if you paid with keypoints. Only the voucher said August 3, and the sales assistant assumed that was the expiry date, despite the fact we'd only received the voucher a few days earlier (It was August 10 at the time). It took her supervisor, and her manager and a call to UBS to determine it was in fact the date of issue, not expiry. (That's the short version, I'm sure I've posted the long version here in the past).

			Don't just drive over the border and hope you get lucky, and the Apotheke has it in stock. Work out where the closest town/Apotheke is across the border, call ahead and explain your situation, and I am sure they will be happy to order it for you - if they don't have it in stock, it can be ordered to get to them within half a day.   
If you need help, PM me and I will be happy to do what I can (eg. phoning up etc.) from here in Germany - unfortunately, I'm nowhere near a border.

You do not normaly need an equivalency for working at a private firm. Basically, you only need a recongnition in fields where there are special requirements (teaching, medicine etc.).   
If you plan to study at a university (Masters degree) i'd advise you to ask the admission services of the U in question whether they recognise your degree.

			One thing to consider for the slightly longer term is which school you would put your children into.  The local swiss schools do not necessarily have a canteen or lunchroom so children are expected to go home for lunch.  There are lunch clubs (mittagtisch) but these are not always everyday and I think they are prioritised for working women.  SO you can find yourself in the situation (as I do) of having to be home at midday every school day to welcome your child home and give them lunch before taking them back to school in the afternoon (this restriction can drive you a little bit mad!). 
The international and private sector though seem to routinely offer a lucnh service.   
Realistically, prepare yourself for a bit of a bumpy ride - you're making a number of major changes to you life and these are bound to have an impact - forewarned is forearmed.

			Hi Chefnils!   
I just found your post after asking a similar question in the Commercial section of the forum (here's the  ). Did you have any luck finding a suitable kitchen to rent?   
My girlfriend is looking to rent a kitchen 1-2 days per week in Zürich City or Winterthur, in which to bake. Mornings till midday is all she'd need.   
Many thanks in advance!

			It's just not worth repairing electronics like cameras here in Switzerland unless they really are expensive.  
I have been a Sony fan for years, and whenever a small device that is older than 8 months old has a problem, the Sony center always encourages a replace rather than fix.  
Does your camera still use the memory sticks? I just replaced my Cybershot with a Benq from Office World, but I have to forget about using the memory sticks. 
Hope this helps.

I use FreeSat at home which is great.    
But if you are using the net there is   which gives you access to many many stations throughout the world including UK.   
They also have a cool app (paid) for your phone that works just as well.

On that date there is a Young Boys (Berne) v Basel match in Berne which may be the decider of who wins the championship (they are currently in 1st & 2nd positions with 3 points separating them. I just checked for you, but unfortunately, tickets are sold out ! you never know you might find some on anibis.ch 
That's probably as good as you'll get in Switzerland. However that is nothing compared with a good match in UK or Italy (probably France & Germany too, though I don't really know these championships).  
Also last date of the season in Italy, if you go to   you can see AC Milan v Juventus ticket details. Expensive but if it's anything like the AC Milan matches I've seen, a fantastic experience your brother will love.

I have rarely seen people doing this except on areas close to or on the shores of lakes   
In my experience making a quick call is really a better way to do things, once we did one in Solothurn kanton (near Gempen) & the man who looked after it actually came over to check we were OK. Don't be surprised then if a older guy in a Subaru just appears out of nowhere (they don't bite), be friendly & maybe offer him a sausage. 
 Usually they do it voluntarily which is unheard of where I come from & to have this facility so well kept is one of the great pleasures of outdoor life here in the summer.    
I have noted that at least kantons BL, NW, OW, ZG, LU, BE & SO all have this or a similar system.

			I bought an Opinel and a Laguiole in France, in Annecy. In general I've noticed that every souvenir shop in Zürich sells plain Opinel, obviously at double price you might pay for the same in France.  
Try the knives-shop in Poststrasse (in front of the Gucci shop if I'm not wrong) a crossroad of Banhofstrasse. 
The price should be around 20-25 chf for an Opinel with a blade of 10cm.

I am thinking of selling a condo in Switzerland.  Most ""stuff"" will stay with the condo but there are some family heirlooms that I would like.  Example: we have a large antique chest/box that has been in the family for 200 plus years. A few pictures. Im also have two new but very expensive outdoor chairs.     
Is it possible to ship this stuff through my airline since it's not nearly enough for a container?     
I would also like to bring back 4-5 cases of good wine that we have accumulated.   
Any suggestions appreciated.  We are in Graubunden and need to ship to NY or Florida

The fact I have a kid is not to be contributed to my sore butt. It's not that bad, really. But having two brothers does not help, they always made these long elaborate whips, every year new ones. They had to get up early in the morning, go to the lake to find a proper willow tree and braid them. Then, after they ""used"" it on me and mom and dozens of other chicks and collected candy, cash, eggs and shots of liqueur, they had to plant them whips to have them grow into trees. That's the pagan tradition. Sometimes I went with them, carried the basket with their ""pray"" for a slight commission, haha. People eat eggs dozen different ways 2wks after Easter back there..          Ah, that's so true. I should get down to some knedlik making. I will let you know when I make them, you guys should come over for some pivo and knedels.

			A PhD  program here (in CH) usually you dont have to pay at all, it is funded by the canton or states.    
Regarding the courses, usually it depends on each program. A lot of PhD program do have little courses to take. At least that was my case. Although the candidates need to write research reports and papers (drafts) etc. And of course, as others said, the candidate will need to teach or do some lab work, research work for the professors.    
You friend may try those public universities for the PhD. The one you are talking about, I never heard of.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Oct 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	European Graduate school in Switzerland: Reviews?	CHW	Posts: 20

Students at the conservatories usually offer lessons to beginners or intermediate players at very reasonable rates. If you are however an advanced player and have no major plans other than to play at leisure, you can easily learn the pieces yourself rather than seeking a teacher.   
I have a friend at the Lausanne music conservatory at the moment and will be happy to ask for contacts if thats the route you want to take.

			If there was a planeful of Corsebous who whine and whinge all the darn time, it would be no surprise why there's a 2 hour delay.   
If the flight is delayed 2 hours and they did give you 2 free calls per passenger, wouldn't the flight then be delayed more than 2 hours?   
Just take pictures of your bag with the webcam you're selling    
On a serious note, if you deal with customer-facing staff like you're posting on here sometimes, you might end up with service that's inferior to that I have experienced.   
Once my bag missed the plane to the UK and I simply went to the counter, reported it, asked them if I should wait and informed them that the place I was going to was 4 hours' drive away.  No problem they said and no problem it was when the bag arrived next day and was delivered to my destination - free of charge.   
That took all of 5 minutes.

			Did anyone happen to watch Kassensturz last night? There was a segment on selling gold. A jeweler told me in advance to watch it. It was really interesting to see the different offers for the same gold jewelery. They also showed how gold is melted down and showed how to test what karat of gold something is.   
The highest price paid for gold jewerly was from Goldrausch.     
They have an online calculator and an interesting clip from where they were featured on SF Aktuell.

5804	06.09.2009, 21:17	Forum Legend	Thanked 39,302 Times in 12,287 Posts	Location: GL	"    The Bürkliplatz is named after a guy called Bürkli who was cheifly responsible for reclaiming that area. The lake shores were rather marshy in those days, and as you say, the town stopped well short of the present waterfront. As part of a bigger scheme to regulate the water level (preventing flooding etc) an area of land was reclaimed and a proper lakefront created in the 19th Century. Previously there had been a water course along what is now Bahnhofstrasse (originally part of the city defences) and this was blocked as part of the work. This why that if you look at the buildings, you will find there are a lot of very old (mediaevil) buildings in the side streets of Bahnhofstrasse, but none actually on Bahnhofstrasse. There wasn't a road here in those days but just the city wall and the moat. Also towards the lake you will find that the mediaevil houses stop about where Fraumünster is and beyond that towards the lake it's all 19th Century or newer. This was marshland previously to that. Also, there was no bridge at Bellevue until the earl 20th Century (about) and the first bridge was the one at Fraumünster.      Could be, but I doubt it as the Limmat was dredged at the time that the various islands were removed. The present day Coop at Hauptbahnhof stands on what was once an isalnd as there was once also a water channel between it and the houses. The road underpass you drive through when passing haupbhanhof headed for the Urania bridge is actually part of that former channel. When this was blocked they had to dredge the Limmat to make it deeper to take the extra water.

			I've been away from my guitar for some time now and would like to start playing again.  I don't want to start a band, don't particularly care for 'jam sessions', am too out of practice for Open Mics (if such a thing were common in CH), and am not interested in lessons right now.   
I would propose a once-weekly session where we each take responsibility in rotation for presenting a song or two and some of the fundamentals/theory that go with it.  Perhaps a bit of an academic approach, but I'm open to other ideas.  I do think there ought to be a little structure to keep things interesting and beneficial for all involved.  I don't think that the material need be genre-specific, or, in many ways, level-specific. 
About me: 
I've been playing instruments for about twenty years now, guitars for a little over ten.  I've had a college-level theory course and have been in various original bands playing  ,   , and singing.  I haven't played a guitar in earnest for about four years.  I listen to a lot of different music but my primary passion is that nebulous beast Indie Rock.

5823	null	null	null	null	"        Mobile phone allows boss to snoop    By Michael Fitzpatrick, Tokyo     Researchers have produced a mobile phone that could be a boon for prying bosses wanting to keep tabs on the movements of their staff.    Japanese phone giant KDDI Corporation has developed technology that tracks even the tiniest movement of the user and beams the information back to HQ.    It works by analysing the movement of accelerometers, found in many handsets.    Activities such as walking, climbing stairs or even cleaning can be identified, the researchers say.    The company plans to sell the service to clients such as managers, foremen and employment agencies.    ""Technically, I think this is an incredibly important innovation,"" says Philip Sugai, director of the mobile consumer lab at the International University of Japan.    ""For example, when applied to the issue of telemedicine, or other situations in which remotely monitoring or accessing an individual's personal movements is vital to that service.    ""But there will surely be negative consequences when applied to employee tracking or sales force optimisation.""    Complex behaviour    Until now, mobile phone motion sensors were capable of detecting only repetitive movements such as walking or running.     It beggars belief that a prominent company such as KDDI could come up with such a surveillance system. It's totally irresponsible   Kazuo Hizumi Human rights lawyer    The KDDI system, is able to detect more complex behaviour by using analytical software - held on a server back at base - to match patterns of common movements.    For example, the KDDI mobile phone strapped to a cleaning worker's waist can tell the difference between actions performed such as scrubbing, sweeping, walking an even emptying a rubbish bin.    The aim of the new system, according to KDDI, is to enable employees to work more efficiently and managers to easily evaluate their employees' performance while away from the office.    ""It's part of our research into a total ubiquitous technology society, and activity recognition is an important part of that,"" said Hiroyuki Yokoyama, head of web data research at KKDI's research labs in Tokyo.    ""Because this technology will make central monitoring possible with workers at several different locations, businesses especially are very interested in using such technology to improve the efficiency of their workers.    ""We are now at a stage where we can offer managers a chance to analyse more closely the behaviour of staff.""    KDDI says it is in talks with a Japanese employment agency that specializes in contract cleaners and security and is interested in deploying the new technology.    'Mothering System'    ""Of course there are privacy issues and any employers should really enter into an agreement with employees before using such a system,"" Mr Yokoyama told BBC News.    ""But this is not about curtailing employees' rights to privacy. We'd rather like to think our creation more of a caring, mothering system rather than a Big Brother approach to watching over citizens.""    It is not the first time remote spying technology has been enlisted by employers to keep an eye on their workforce in Japan or elsewhere.    Lorry drivers are regularly monitored through mobile phones in Japan, while salespeople have been regularly tracked by their employers using GPS since it was introduced to Japanese mobiles in 2002.    Critics of such systems accuse the makers of pandering to an over-controlling, Big Brother-type managerial class and say that with this new technology there comes the increased opportunity for abuse.    'Poor record'    ""This is treating people like machines, like so many cattle to be monitored and watched over,"" Kazuo Hizumi, a leading human rights lawyer, told BBC News.    ""New technology should be used to improve our lives not to spy on us.    ""It beggars belief that a prominent company such as KDDI could come up with such a surveillance system. It's totally irresponsible.""    Japan had a very poor record on human rights, privacy issues and consumer rights, said Mr Hizumi.    For this reason, he said, invasive technologies were readily accepted as there was little debate on their possible impact to be found in the media in Japan or among its people.    ""I'm afraid ordinary citizens don't care about this lack of rights. Consequently because of technology like this, Japan is heading for the Dark Ages,"" said Mr Hizumi.

Cheap ones are the super markets, Manor, Migros, Coop (Christ) more expensive are the brand stores, Cartier etc.    
The price of gold doesn't vary, it's according to the international prices, mark up on jewelry is usualy x 4 (yes, 400%).    
You get what you pay for, the expensive brand shops' products are easier to sell on the second hand market, but you'll still lose approx 50%. Cheap shops, the second hand value is weight x price of gold minus a large chunk.    
PS, 18ct gold usualy used here, is only 75% gold, so you need to account for this on the gold price. If you take 50% of the gold price x the weight that is approx value you get when you sell 18ct pieces.

			My son travelled into Geneva using easyjet last year with a guitar in a soft case.    
When he told me that he was going to bring his guitar over I started to investigate easyjet rules. The guitar is too fragile to go in the hold. It is too expensive to telephone easyjet and I find their web site time consuming in trying to obtain answers to unusual questions. So the next time I was at the airport I went to the easyjet information desk. It turns out you are allowed to buy a seat on the plane for a musical instrument.  This means you need to book early to buy the cheapest possible seats.  Also, obviously, the instrument must be worth the seat value in monetary or emotional terms. They told me concerned customers regularly do this and there would be no problem.  I am very happy to say there was no problem.    
Should you go for this option, I would re-check they have not changed their rules. (I booked on-line - putting Mr. Guitar for name!)   
I cannot speak about other airlines as easyjet was our only option from the airport he was travelling from.    
I wish you luck - I know how stressful the whole thing is. My husband and son are guitar mad!   "	earned the respect of many	Join Date: Feb 2008	Groaned at 5 Times in 3 Posts	Bringing gift of Guitar in to Switzerland	glendamwm	Posts: 527

			If you're already resigned to losing your data, and are not going to go for a specialised recovery, you can resort to more extreme measures: 
1) freeze it in a plastic bag for a couple of hours, then plug it in again 
2) give it a not too hard whack on the edge of the table   
Neither have high success rates, but I've done them both before and they do work, occasionally !

In a nutshell: There is usually no consumer protection for customers of accounting firms due to the commercial nature of such relationships.   I usually pay even bills I do not agree with since I want to avoid a Betreibung. Whether I complain or not depends on the situation and the money involved, in many cases, it is easier to let it go than to complain or even to start legal proceedings.

			No longer the oddoneout! I too, can ride a bicycle after following many of the techniques described in this thread over the Easter weekend. I only just came across the thread through a forum search, though, my boyfriend taught me to ride a bike this way because he's been riding for years and he intuited that this would be the best method. The scariest part was learning to balance; ironically that was the quickest to get over. The key to not giving up is to keep at it - put in a couple of hours of trying each day and then give it a rest and go at it the next day. I don't think I could have learned to ride in six hours of one day, but broken up into two hours each over three days, I did learn. The learning curve was happily steep: I went from being scared to take my feet off the handlebars on Thursday, to squeezing the brakes hard every two seconds on Friday, to crashing into hedges every two feet on Saturday (a neighbor asked if he needed to get an ambulance!), to happily riding around the block on Sunday, and even learning how to make turns nicely (not without a few more missteps, ouch!)   
Now my biggest challenge is to find someplace to ride... I don't want my poor bf to have to take me out daily for bike rides so I can get my bearings, but I'm really uncomfortable riding in traffic at the moment, even though I see lots of cyclists doing it all the time. I need to follow someone around for a few weeks, I think, and maybe get a few more kilometers of ""quiet road"" riding under my belt so I can get used to the feel of the bike, figure out when and how to change gears, practice starting and stopping a million times.    
I wish you were in Geneva so we could meet up and go out for rides together! (Is anyone?) Anyway, how did it go - did you learn yet? Try to find a teacher who's patient... it will take a lot of repetition and even you will find yourself getting impatient to get started already! Now if only I could plunge into the cars and pedestrians fearlessly   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Bicycle riding lessons for an adult wanted	angenoir	Posts: 37

A guy from the Observer saw it all & offered me silly money for the film but I had legged it down to the Embankment & as you see on the newsreels of that day, the police were very heavy so I just kept going.

			I sometimes think its not so much about putting in all the hours god sends to get yourself a career to earn a decent crust, its more to do with finding a career that you enjoy doing, pays a reasonable salary and also where the market cant dry up instantly.   
I recently had the same conversation with my 16yr old nephew and advised him to look at these options.  I suggested dentistry - when was the last time you saw a poor dentist!?

			How about a short trip to Colmar in France? It's about 50 min with a train from Basel, so round about 2 hours from you(?). 
I find this little city very romantic. It is very small, but it is so special. The houses are very special and it has a 'Little Venice' where you can take a short trip with a gondola. Plenty of restaurants of course, you can have nice meals with reasonable prizes and some cute french waiters making you girlfriend all      If not, I'm blond...

			I think with the technological advancements, it is possible to keep long distance relationships.   
Get Broadband, get Trubrite Laptop, a Webcam... and get going    
You can have a morning lover in Americas (depending on time zones), afternoon love in Europe and late evening love in Far East... The only mistake you would make is if you stick with one    
There was this lady who would check into a hotel, wear sexy lingerie and full works in terms of makup... just to talk to her lover on the PHONE!!!   
So theres hope.. cant stay how long they'll last but relationships even in real life dont last that long... so what the heck   "	slipped a little	Join Date: Nov 2009	Groaned at 2 Times in 2 Posts	How to maintain long distance relationship?	farra hidlor	Posts: 101

			Unless you are worried about saving a coupe of CHF here and there, I really wouldn't worry about it. The banks'll screw you one way or another.   
I tend to pitch up at the first cash point I get to and withdraw a largish amount that should keep me going for a few days (you should limit the number of withdrawals overall).

			I do (well a poltergeist), and I'm supposed to be a totally rational scientist.  
In brief, myself, my girlfriend (now wife) and a friend were all witnesses as I 'unlocked' a door to a small windowless toilet on the third floor of a very old house, which had been stubbornly locked all day. Nothing had worked to get this door open, and by 9 pm that evening, we were worried that there might be a junkie / suicide in there. (It was not a good neighbourhood). The landlord had given me his permission to try to break down the door, but it had not budged as I shoulder charged it a number of times. 
How did I unlock it? The door had clearly been salvaged from another building, as in addition to the main heavy duty locking mechanism adjacent to the handle, only accessible from inside the small room, there was a small metal plaque at eye level containing a white plastic disk on which the words 'Vacant' and 'Engaged' were printed. Turning a slotted screw allowed one to turn the disk, but   Turning the screw moved the disk  . Nevertheless, on turning the plastic disk so that 'Vacant' now showed in the gap in the plate, the door, which had resisted all earlier batterings, swung gently open. Needless to say, the small room, which could only be locked from the inside, was dark and empty. 
Ugh, my skin still crawls remembering this, and this was 15 years ago.   
Cheers   
Jim

			So, problem solved.    
I just did a whirlwind tour of Zurich, hitting about 8 shops in a two hour period. I quickly realized that it would be hard to find something fancy as most stores have cleared out their winter things and were loading the spring merchandise onto the floor as I ran around. I had resigned myself to finding a knee-length dress (tried a few long ones on which were too short) when I stumbled upon a long, very cool and elegant black number at Feldpausch. It was the last one and still more than I wanted to pay, but already 50% off of the original price and in my size (had to do a minor alteration, but the saleslady said I was the first person to buy it without shortening it   ). Got a little sheer long-sleeved sweater thing (I guess it's this year's wrap) to cover up the shoulders so I'm good to go. Thanks everyone, for your help and advice!

I'm not sure what angle they are going for there, do they want my furniture or just making sure the house will be clear?? why even ask when your offer has been refused??   
I'm getting bad vibes from them so I'll probably tell them to stick it anyway, last thing I need is to arrange to clear the house, go back to the uk to sign papers etc and have them try to pull a fast one like try to change there offer on contract signing day.

			There are some very good life insurance products on the market.   
You have to read up quite a bit though to make sure you get cover with decent invalidity and death cover.   
I think ""independent"" is the right word. There are not many around.   
For example, some companies are very good with health insurance, but there life policies are not that great and vice versa.   
I went round all the banks in Vevey to see about high interest long term savings accounts. The best one I found was UBS who are offering 4% (I think) but you can't withdraw any of your money until you retire.   
Most life insurance products will give you 6% - 8% plus you have cover for death and invalidity, and you can usually withdraw your money after some time (for example 10 years / 15 years or whatever).   
If you have a specific question, you can pm me.

			Does anybody know of any travel agencies in Switzerland that sell gift cards for the value of a grand or two? I looked at Denner and Hotelplan and can't seem to find anything.   
I want to get my parents a trip for their 30th anniversary, but don't want to bind them to a certain date, so I'll let them choose. Gift cards seem to be the answer, but I can't find any travel agency that does this.   
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

			Oops, yeah sorry, I was visiting the inlaws in Wildhaus, St.Gallen when I wrote that. By Sunday they had over 50cm of snow and I had to dig my car out before i left *lol* Made me think of back home in Ottawa... except attempting 3 times to drive up the hill outside the house to try and leave and driving 20km an hour down the super long, winding, damn icy road down the mountain (Ottawa is a valley so I'm really not used to that... nor the lack of salt/salt)

I am recently bogged by some disturbing post acne scars and have finally decided on getting microdermabrasion treatment done.     Has anyone done it before here in Geneva? And if yes, how was it? If you don't mind sharing, how much did the treatment cost you? And recommendations of course.      I also understand that you can purchase this treatments in 5/6 (a course) as a session or two is not suffice.     Found a clinique below that offers this service:     -Dr Nicolas Roux

			Dear all,   
I am David Jansen, a animal behaviour PhD student at Zurich University.  
The fieldwork of my PhD is in Uganda and more specifically in Queen Elisabeth National Park. At the moment I am briefly back in Switzerland to analyse some data and prepare futher experiments. I am going back in a few weeks time.    
The reason of this post is that I would like to help the local autoraties in the park with the good work they are doing for wildlife conservation in the park. The rangers and wardens are really doing the best can, but are limited because of lack of resourses. An exaples is that there is only 1 computer to be used for the analysis of monitoring data (e.g. what are the hot spots of poaching, were do people cut down trees or kill the predators). In addition the rangers go on patrol and mostly don't have simple equipment like a set of binoculars.    
When I had out in a few weeks time I would like to give them some support. So my question would be if some of you still have that old laptop or binoculars lying around that you don't really use or need. If so, please contact me. Really no problem if it is a bit older or has a few sratches.  
Also if you want donation can be official as I have the contribution form. 
In any case I'll make sure you get a personal note from the people in the park.   
Thanks a lot in advance and greets, 
David

			Are there any players that want to jam.  I left a coverband in the US that played old rock mostly.  I will be moving to Schaffhausen soon although I live near the border in Germany.  I play drums but I haven't shipped my sets here yet.  I wondered if it is better to just pick up a set here.  The venues I've seen had drummers with 4-7 piece kits and no e kits that I've noticed.  Any advice from weekend warriors or full timers would be appreciated.  I have a day job so this is a fun and beer money adventure.  Are there open mikes or jams with the backline furnished so I can just bring sticks?  Thanks in advance and I'm looking forward to meeting and playing with you.   
Let the good times roll..

			I have a magic box imp, it is wonderful. (It's a reciva based chipset branded as the imp, others are just as good).   
It sits on my bedside table and wakes me up every morning with Radio4. I have absolutely no trouble with the BBC streaming service and it is a very rare day when the stream goes down. I have Radio4, Radio3 and World service set as 3 of the 5 main presets, they all work very well.    
My only complaint is that the access to listen again is a bit tedious since you have to twiddle a lot of knobs to get what you want. I generally use the PC for listen again rather than the bedside radio. (alright I have a few other complaints, but nothing serious that outweights the advantages)   
In the future I plan on investing in an old netbook (Asus eee 701) type PC from ebay when the prices drop a little. then I will have an easy way of accessing listen again via bookmarks etc and a GUI to browse, whilst still maintaining my regular live stream. As an alarm clock I find the reciva based solution simply fantastic. As a serious Radio4 addict I would be lost without it. I will keep the imp as a bedside radio and use the netbook in the kitchen. I also use a transmitter and wireless speakers to broadcast the radio around the house which enables me to listen to anything anywhere.

			I've got a microSD card which fits nicely in my phone, but I feel the transfer rates are a$$-slow with the phone-USB connection.   
Unfortunately I've apparently lost the 'make-it-bigger' SD card adapter. Is it possible to get a new one of these for close to nothing?   
Or perhaps one of those USB sticks which the microSD card slides into? Anyone know price ranges for a little bit of convenience?   
Does anyone have some details on whether or not it will be faster, or am I just impatient.

good luck and have fun exploring ...the language shouldnt be a problem , just as many english speakers as swiss german i'd say   
failing that , Sorrento is nice this time of the year....

			despite the obvious security concerns, Zurich airport is very friendly. The airport's website itself provides this:

Anyway, the airport tour itself is really cool. You should time it so that you get to the runway intersection at around noon when the bigger jets take off. You will feel the ground shaking and the wind behind the planes.. awesome.

You are fine to buy a Euromillions ticket online from   when abroad but not the normal lottery. Their website can tell if you purchase your ticket abroad from the IP address and will send you an email advising you that they noticed your ticket was purchased using a foreign IP address.   
I have been doing the national lottery whilst I have been living abroad for over five years and they only picked up on this about two years ago. Apparently they can without your winnings if they suspect you have purchased your ticket abroad but they only investigate for winning over 5000 GBP. I have a National Lottery account which I keep topped up and then when my tickets expire I forward the reminder to my father in law and he then accesses my Lottery account and purchases my Lottery ticket.   
I hope this helps.   Good Luck

If your partner is employed in the UK then he will have deductions for tax and social security - social security is used for state pensions and the NHS and other things.  You do not need to pay anything towards the NHS - you are covered under his deductions (and in fact under the rest of the populations deductions) which, by the way, are a fixed % of gross salary and do not change according to how many people are in the family.

			No, but I can give you the translation for google:   
Kachel-Aufkleber  
Kachelfolie   
Tile(s) = ""Kachel"", ""Fliesen"", or in Swiss-German ""Plättli"" 
Sticker = ""Aufkleber"" (""Folie"" = would be an adhesive foil in this case)   
Try with or without hyphen, with any of the words for ""tile"" and you should get some results.    
I expect you would be able to get them in DIY stores (Jumbo and such).

			Hi guys. I've just discovered a really   that shows you commerces and services of any kind you want within 5, 10 or 25 km of the Swiss city or postal code you type in. I assumed you would already know about it, but I searched the forum and didn't find any references to it, so I thought I'd share. Sorry if this has already been mentioned.     's a classified list of repertoires, classified by type of service: grocery stores, restaurants, furniture stores, doctors, geologists (you never know when you may need a geologist). You can also search by typing in your keywords (""rechercher par mot clé""). It's pretty great.   
In French and German. Enjoy!

			Throughout Switzerland, utility companies are very similar. To help you, if you have a problem or query, you do need to be a little more specific.   
Edited to add. 
As soon as you rent a place, the electricity company will send you a bill every three or four months. The first ones will be estimates, but always at some point in the year, there will be a definite reading and subsequent debit/credit, forwarded to the leaser, depending on personal usage. HTH

			We have a stall in the Wednesday speciality market, I wasn't aware there was one on Saturdays. The cabins in the HB recently were for the Christmas market and you have to rent one for the whole 30 days, cost is around 10,000 chufs all in for the month.   
The   one depends on the space you take and what you rent from them: tables, power points etc, but allow up to 300 for each day. There is a long waiting list though and it depends on what you want to sell and how many other stalls are already selling your type of product, they're quite fussy about who comes in - we had to wait almost 2 years for our cheese stall.   
Good luck

			Yes, but it is not so direct.  You will probably have to prove that 
your German is at a decent level.  One girl I knew had to pass 
the Zentralmittelstufenprüfung in German, or ZMP to attend 
a school.   
Find out what you want to do career wise and then talk to an 
admissions counselor at the respective school.

Seeing the default was ""impossible to miss"", it hardly likely the shop would have sold it without checking, if only to avoid this type of problem. Maybe your friend damaged it putting in the car or somehow during transport. You seem to assume that as it's damaged the only possibility is it's the shops fault or responsibility when you or your friend had responsibility during the transport.

6047	31.07.2009, 17:59	Newbie	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: Basel	"    The work experience may be the real challenge. Here I suggest you ask your parent(s) to see if they can pull some strings for you at their workplace. Afterall, the reason you are here is likely due to a relocation. Asking your parents employer for assistance is not inappropriate, in my opinion.    
It is not easy to try and meet everyone's needs when moving and I think most parents do try and balance everyone's needs. I hope your parents are helping you with this. There are plenty of non Swiss students who are not fluent in a local language pursuing their education here. It can be done.    
Asking HR to see if they assist in some way with helping you find a position that will qualify as appropriate work experience is not too much to ask. If you don't already have one, put together a CV and write a cover letter explaining what course you intend to study and the work qualifications you need for acceptance.    
In support of your application, a school may also request that you attend an interview.    
One last point, it is quite common here for students to be older than you are when they begin their studies. There are a variety of reasons why they may have had to postpone the start date for their studies (military service, for example).    
Good luck and I hope things work out for you.

With a 4GB card the top LCD display will say a bit less than 300, but Nikons method of judging how many pictures will fit on a card seems to be quite pessimistic so IME 300 shouldn't be a problem. As for brand I've always used Sandisk without problems.   
You should get a UV filter if only to protect the front element of the lens, and a circular polariser. The polariser can help with reducing reflections and haze. Do make sure it's a circular polariser and not a linear polariser.

			Actually, I posted only to make one point -i.e. that this financial crisis is not a crisis of capitalism. It was chiefly engendered by government intervention in the housing market, and inflation of the money supply under Greenspan-Bernanke.   
Most economic problems in fact can be traced back to today's terrible monetary system - e.g. the U.S. dollar has already lost at least 97% of its value in less than a 100 years. The Swiss franc has fared much better - losing about ~88% of its value. These figures were taken from a circulated Fed report (circa 2003?).   
This is not a lone opinion - check out William White's writings (of the Bank for International Settlements), who had long warned about such issues.     
Since whatever government intervention creates secondary consequences - there will thus be a greater crisis somewhere down the line. However, the world is already convinced that ""capitalism"" has failed - and the ""socialist"" model is more palatable.

This is here:    
But this is no use for us in Switzerland,    
For example you choose your food stuff, and the website compare how much it will cost you at migros, Denner, Coop, etc...

Last year, the kids put up the old artificial tree and strung it full of big glasssy shiny baubles, glitter strings, etc...... looked real sophisticated.  And then the two young kittens were left alone in the lounge.  And the tree had NOTHING on it anymore.  The kittens loved the tree, but lost interest after they`d swiped the last bauble off, and shredded the glitter strings.   
Christmas day we had just a bare tree.   
Nein, I am not cruel - they would not have scrambled all over a cactus!

			Hi I know this thread is approx. 2 years old but I was wondering how you got on with the move?.  I am keen to know if you move furniture from Swiss to France in a van what are the implications at the border i.e. for a couch or something.  Do you pay tax on second hand items or is it the same?.  I tried looking at the border site but got totally lost.  Thanks for your help if you can.

			Hi Ricardo,   
I just saw your old post in the English Forum asking about piano teachers in Geneva. Your post is over a year old, but I thought I'd write anyway on the off chance that you hadn't found a teacher yet.  
I am actually an English speaking piano teacher from Australia who is completing postgraduate studies in piano performance at the conservatoire here. Just PM me if you would like more details. 
Best Wishes,

			Danekova,   
if you register an email account with Gmail, you have the option to import your Yahoo account and reply from the Gmail account using your current Yahoo address.  
No need to worry about letting everyone know about a change of address.   
Other servers will offer this as well, I just found Gmail had the most flexible options.   
Once you have registered yourself an account with gmail, go to settings, then, accounts and import.  
From there you will see all the various options you have.  
Not complicated and not set in stone either. You can always change at a later date, should you wish to.   
I recommend not to archive all emails in Gmail, as that may result in you getting the same email twice. Although, better twice than not at all    
Doing this, will mean you have all your emails saved on both accounts, you have also the option to import copies of all your Yahoo mail into your Gmail inbox etc, which may also be good for you. You can reply from either account and for your contacts, they will see you just as you were and still be able to use your address as they know it.   
This way if one server has a glitch, the other one not, at least, hopefully not, at the same time anyway.   
I find the whole Gmail concept generally, to be very good and perhaps you may be able to have trouble free emailing in the future.

			most cheap cartridge replacements use cheap ink that fades over a short period of time or is not as pure as other which can clog your printer just as fast. Some of these will also cause your printer to misprint up to 50-80% of the time if you get them working. If you simply print plain documents, these are probably fine but photos, don't waste your money.   
If you insist on keeping your old machine, you could buy some rubbing alcohol (70%) from your pharmacy and spray the head and tank rests to clean and disolve the old ink.

			Even if not going through an agency, legally employing a cleaner isn't really complicated and does not add much to the costs. Unfortunately I found it quite difficult to find one that would accept to be declared, it seems a lot of people doing this job not only escape taxes by being undeclared but also collect some kind of social help that they'd otherwise lose.    
For those in Romandie I can recommend   (sorry link in French) I'd say it takes about one hour to establish the initial paperwork and then about 5 minutes per month to pay and report the work hours done.

			I think you'll get the low end of the market at 400 francs; if you're prepared to pay 600, you have more options.   
I'm a fan of the Hugo Boss store in Foxtown Mendrisio.  There is also an excellent place or two on the lower levels with good selections available.  But again, 5-600 francs.   
I recently saw some 400 franc suits ""on offer"" which were of crap material, cut and stitching.

			There are quite a few reliable options for having your US mail forwarded internationally.  When my husband and I first moved to Australia, we had family members sending us our mail, but this became time consuming for my elderly parents, as well as other family members that just plain got tired of the hassle.    
We decided to start using a mail and parcel forwarding service and haven't looked back since.  I don't want to seem biased.  I use Bongo International and have been very happy with their service but here is a list of numerous options.               
I would suggest doing your research and finding which service works best for you.  This is how I came to like and use Bongo.  
I encourage others to comment and give feedback as well as other forwarding options I haven't mentioned because I know there are tons.

Your are of course right about the other flag it is indeed called the Union flag but the term Jack is often as it is an old form of the word flag.     
The Flag Institute (2007) accepts that the term Union Jack has been in existence since 1606 and I think once you have 400 years of history on your side you can call it either term.     
The most important thing when displaying the flag is to make sure that it is not upside down....

			Hello,   
We have just moved into a newly constructed house. We had our bedrooms wallpapered; before the work, I called and emailed various times to receive a cost proposal so I would know how much the bill would come to. The company then called me and over the phone told me the total, which I agreed to. I then again tried to get this in written but received no answer. Stupidly I trusted them, also having other things on my mind (newborn, toddler, moving), and forgot to chase them. So I never received ANYTHING in written from this company, just their invoice, which is off by about 3000CHF.    
What are my rights in this case? Off course, I will talk to the ""bauherr"" of our building, as all the construction & paint etc went through him, and I will draft a letter mentioning the invoice in incorrect and the steps I have taken, but I have a feeling it will be a ""their word against mine"" situation and being a foreigner whose Swiss German is not perfect, I feel I am in the losing end of the court...   
Any tips anyone? I dont want to get threatening right away as I want them to have the chance to see their mistake. Unfortunatly, Swisscom wont divulge any phone conversations, I already tried that as in that converstaion he mentioned the price and I asked 3 times if this was the total without VAT an he confirmed this.   
Thanks, P.

however, if you have a games console like a ps3 or xbox then you can quite easily stream movies and things to that wirelessly from a mac.

			I'd agree, if you'd like to shop in person, head across the border.    
If you are not so keen on ""shopping"" there are some online shops from UK which ship to Switzerland (I've not tried any myself as yet), maybe (hopefully) good quality for the price.   
Meanwhile, my m-i-l has been buying from   for quite some time and I have ordered a few things from them myself. I won't say it is top quality but it also isn't horrible - plenty good for home and about doing day-to-day things, I'm less confident they'd have anything on offer that you'd want to wear to a job interview.

Or if they have a message board, just post a memo about looking for some friends to chill with.

			If you're looking for a new laptop, make sure to get it in the UK if the keyboard layout is important to you. Also, if you use a desktop, bring a spare keyboard with you if you've got space, etc. It is difficult to get a quality english language layout keyboard (and you're more likely to find a US layout than a UK layout here).

			Personally I am really old-school. I still dislike the Itunes usage of meta data to organise my music. It never really does it the way I like and then I can't find my music.  
So I keep on using folders the way I did it say 8-10 years ago.  
_blues\band\album 
_classic rock\band\album 
Unsorted Band\album 
and then drag and drop into winamp (classic). 
I have yet to see someone use any of the above mentioned programs in a really efficient and fast way. But perhaps that's also due to faulty meta data in many of my Mp3s.

			It's a myth that people working in finance work longer hours in New York than elsewhere. From my own experience people in Asia work longer hours (because they are ahead of both Europe and New York), then comes London (because they are behind Asia but ahead of New York) and finally comes New York who work the least hours of all because by their evening Europe and Asia are closed.

			Sharia law must be revised and brought into the 21st century.  I respect that some women choose to wear the hijab because it helps them to be anonymous, also because they do not attract as much sexual attention. In this sense Muslim women are no different to many other women. However to live in a state where it is enforced, even in excessive heat and where it limits mobility, to me, contravenes human rights.   
Many Muslims to me are trying to change Sharia law- it is a very dangerous but necessary task. However there is a lot in the Muslim religion that I like. 
I really enjoyed the Eid al Fetr celebration, even though I felt bad becuase I broke off fasting after about two weeks.

			Hi all   
Im searching for a jam partner in Zürich. I like to play guitar (mostly blues style, inspired but not limited to the likes of Beck, solo Tex Perkins (The Cruel Sea), anything noisy and/or weird). Although I'm not afraid of pop (Regurgitator, Ben Kweller). I get by with drums (although I do not own a kit, my girlfriends dad does). So things would be pretty lo-fi.   
So basically, just looking for someone who could probably sing as well as play something, and maybe wants to develop some of their own stuff and/or wants to write with me.   
I work normal hours, and Monday I have fussball, but any other day is usually cool.   
You can reach me by PM.   
Cheers

			I have some Leuke already, I really like the stuff. I don't have any bakeforms, though. I do have an angelfood bakeform that I got in the US, and I love it.    
Apparently the guy who designs Leuke is from Luzern, but the company is in Barcelona, I believe. Anyway, I have a steamer insert and something that I can only describe as a sort of envelope. It has a weighted cover. Stick a piece of fish inside and cook in the oven. We use it to cook salmon in the oven, just a little salt and pepper and it's really lovely.    
Just spent 2 hours taking steam oven apart and removing calcium deposits, and am going to Manor on Wednesday to look for forms. Ready to bake.   
Are there brands without teflon that you recommend... not so fond of teflon.

Crescenda is an organization that helps immigrant women gain control of their lives. It was proposed as a possible target charity for the AWC this past spring, so I have their brochure. The cafe in Schutzenmatt Park is one of their projects. The organization is supported by a wide network of other charitable organizations in TNW. 
Anyway, since baking is still a highly respected profession, it is not so easy for the immigrant to break-in. I make an awesome bagel or red-velvet cake in my home kitchen, but I can't set up a website or a stand at Marktplatz and sell them because I'm not a ""baker."" Crescenda might know of a solution suitable for the immigrant with a talent or skill who is locked out of the market. 
Someone correct me if I'm missing the mark here please.

			I bought an EOS 500D the other day, and I find the photos it takes to lack sharpness.  I've read that with the Camera+""Lens Kit"" - the lens is fairly lo-fi, and this accounts for the softness in the resultant photos.   
Of course, maybe it's just me.   
It could do with a CPL filter for bright day shots.   
Works fairly well in the dark, but I haven't had much of a play.  I want to go do some night photos of Basel - but will wait until it's dark a bit earlier.

Ultimately a lot depends on the printing profiles you are using, the camera you are working with and the paper and inks you use.

			Customs charges for books are at the reduced VAT (TVA) rate of 2.9%. BUT it only kicks in if the resulting charge would be greater than 5 chfs, which is approximately 200 chfs worth of books. It's nothing to do with weight.   
The trouble is, it's not only the resulting TVA (which would be very small), it's that once your parcel is 'in the system', then you also have to pay additional admin and processing fees. The overall bill will then be about 40 chfs.   
The easy way to avoid this is to do two orders, a couple of days apart. Shipping is free, so it doesn't matter, and they'll sail through customs then.   
kodokan   
PS: Goods other than books attract VAT at the normal rate of 7.6% - the 'only if it's going to be over 5chfs' rule still applies, but the higher percentage here means that goods over about 65chfs are caught in the net.

			I can't find it on the Ikea website but... perhaps still being able to go with something like the look you want (with the stainless steel - hopefully you have a cleaning lady or else aren't too bothered by the quick acquisition of fingerprints and dust)...   
I have seen while there a kitchen system where they use stainless steel poles to anchor a bar and of course, the bar itself is stainless as well. The poles to support it extend from floor to ceiling so you're not depending on what may simply be some plywood or drywall to hold up your dinner (and your elbows).

			Fribourg:   
i agree, it may not be the liveliest city in Suisse, but then again,e who english-ish is right, those who go to Fribourg, they are there for the ""e.g. less noise, people who say hello in the street, a surprising amount of trust once you start to get to know people (although getting to know people is perhaps more difficult initially, the chance to learn another language, the calm of the mountains, public transport which works and is cheaper than at home, a high concentration of art galleries in a small place, etc..."" (enlglish-ish)   
My boss has a house there, when i was there the  first time, i was SHOCKED, not by how ""unlively"" the town is, but how amazingly pictureresque Fribourg is, or as a matter of fact, Suisse is... 
I was told, over here, the hospitality really is different, and the trust u have for your neighbies is surprising >< 
He also mentioned, he like it here because the quality of the air is just so much better, he feels calmer, as compared to staying in other cities, he also love it that because he's  staying at the countryside, you de-stress your eyes with breathtaking landscape almost at every corner of your eyes.   
It is indeed a beautiful town, but for me, i don't mind visitng or go for a hort getawat from ""it all"".....people who live here also tend to live longer and look younger, they have fresh produce of dairies, legumes and meat. Can't do it any fresher at other place i guess...   
Kudos english-ish, for you have learnt to make peace instead of fighting it...   "	null	null	null	Activities in Fribourg	guest	null

			Hello to you all   
The next issue of Mothering Matters is due out soon. The theme is Relationships. One of the thought-provoking stories is by a mother who raised two children, one very bright child and the other severely disabled. Another writer discusses her failed relationships and how we sometimes just have to accept that not all relationships will be picture-perfect. For those interested in the psychology of personality there is a story on this and how it impacts on our relationships. These are just a few of the topics covered. There is also a cardboard Christmas wreath to make, a recipe for Swiss Brunsli biscuits and a book review for the local book Grüezi Newcomer  Insiders guide around Lake Zürich.   
For those who dont know Mothering Matters, it is not-for-profit and entirely created by a team of volunteers. Every issue has a dedicated theme relevant to parenting and living in Switzerland. Some themes of past issues include: primary schooling, birthing and expat motherhood. Mothering Matters appears six times per year and is only available by subscription. If you are interested in receiving a complimentary copy, please go to the website and request one:      
Best regards 
Andrea

Is your HD Western Digital?   
I had the same problem.   
As a temporary fix, what I did was, connect the adapter to power source without attaching the other end to the WD HD. The light of adapter will be on. After 15 min., I will connect the other end to the WD HD and then connect the USB to my laptop.

IF you are indeed making it yourself, check with the fabric / upholstery shop where you purchased the upholstery, they likely have information on folks who can craft some pillows for you if you are not interested in doing it yourself.

			Hello everybody   
Yesterday evening I lost my cell phone inside the Sport Center at ETH Hönggerberg. I'm pretty sure I left it in the Arena 2 room and I was one of the last people leaving the building at 10pm. Between that time and the morning after, 8:30am, I'm pretty sure nobody entered the room apart from the cleaning service guys. Anyway, it can be wherever because we looked for it in the room in the morning and all around, but nothing.   
If any of you have found it, I'd really appreciate if you could bring it back. It's a Nokia N70, silver, with the usual black strap on the corner.   
You can contact me by PM   
Thanks a lot for any help   
Fabio

It's not be as bad as the US, which is good. Other countries may have a higher absolute number of incidents (and so make the news more frequently), but when you adjust for Switzerland's small population, the  number of gun-related incidents is surprisingly high. The Swiss government is slowly introducing more gun regulations.

			every single parcel we have ever been sent has been opened and a customs bill has been attached, regardless of value, size etc.   
We got sent an el-cheapo personal dvd player, value about 50chf, the sender lied on the form saying it was worth $10, customs opened it and sent us a bill for the value being a couple of hundred chf.   
For the sake of saving £6 I'd bring my gear on the plane, especially as there is a postal strike in the uk, and parcel force are known as parcel farce for a reason.   
Oh and on that note   I had my car stereo sent by parcel farce from the uk to here, 24 hour emergency delivery, cost £80, what they didn't say was the 24 hours was the time it took at each collection point, via there online tracking I could see it took 24 hours to leave the PO, 24 hours to get to the sorting office, 24 hours to get to the airport, 24 hours to clear customs etc etc iirc it took 10 days to get to me (and also came with a customs bill)

not sure if its what you are after as you haven't really listed any specifics but I went to see a band there the other week and quite liked it. Is only a 10 minute or so tram ride (13 Albisgutli) from central Zurich and the hall can be hired. It might help if you said what the event was, your budget, whether you were after a lively bar/club if you wanted music/entertainment, food etc as 200 people is a big number and not many venues are capable (or willing if its a weekend) of coping with a private event that large with maybe the exception of hotels/village halls.   
If its for an xmas event good luck! Many of the better places are booked up well in advance!

			Hi,   
I moved from Sydney to Zurich in March this year and we shipped around 27 boxes (almost 1 cubic meter) through company called Hellas Europe. We did sea cargo with them which took around 15 weeks to arrive once it left Sydney. It cost us AUD 1300.00 for DOOR to DOOR delivery. There was extra 100AUD charge for Customs clearance in UK as ""unfortunately"" the container containing our shipment was selected for the random customs check. Hellas Europe sent the container to UK by sea and from UK it arrived by road to Zurich.    
I can recommend following Sales guy:   Michael Tracey 
Exports Manager

Tel# +61 2 85071399 ; Fax# +61 2 95673600  mt@hellaseurope.com.au     Hope this helps and Good luck with your move.   "	slipped a little	Join Date: Dec 2006	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Shipping stuff from Australia	moosemenner	Posts: 30

			Some good points already...   
So does anyone care to pitch in what they think is an average they would spend on furnishing a full apartment - or that they have spent on furnishing an apartment in Zurich initially?    
50,000 as an estimated amount by Gsach for what an average person would spend - any comments?    
Obviously someone coming on a tight budget wouldn't probably use the service as they would be looking to save wherever possible, but for those who would spend about 50,000 on furniture - what about just making a flat rate of how much it would cost for a week's worth of work (ie hours) to get their flat ready?    
Something like 2,000 - 2,500chf instead of a percentage - actually this would work out at about 5% of the total purchase price if it was around 50,000.    
Any thoughts??   
Also in terms of style analysis - what I mean is that before I would go and purchase anything for the person I would have them fill out a very comprehensive list of likes/dislikes, etc to make sure that I had as many guidelines as possible so that whatever is purchased fits within their taste.    
I like the idea of starting out by offering the service as an Ikea shopping service...that would certainly make it much clearer to the customers at least in terms of their choices and whats on offer.

			Chestnuts (the real ones) should not be stored longer than, say, a few days if meant to be roasted. Before slitting them, put them in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes. Those that float are to be discarded. Soaking the nuts does not only reveal most of the bad (i.e. mouldy) ones, it also makes the slitting process easier, albeit not safer.    
Be careful. You need a very sharp knife and some force, and your fingers are pretty close, so please sign the waiver below (very fine print, readable only with a strong magnifying glass) before proceeding.

However, all (or nearly all) the banks in France have various options for accessing your salary-- from automatic repatriation of the funds for free into a CHF account (so as not to lose on the exchange rate), to fixed rate exchanges for a set amount of time.  My bank (Credit Mutuel) even set up a cyber Swiss 'branch' that I gave my employer and the money went directly into my French account (as it looked Swiss even though it wasn't, if that makes sense).  You can of course also have it sent to a Swiss account and move the money yourself if you can/want to watch exchange rates.      As a 'frontalier' you should have the choice between the French or Swiss regime (at least I did).  I chose Swiss, and could get care in both France and Switzerland (actually, anywhere in the world).      This would be too far and a hassle for me, personally.  And there's not much transportation from there.      I live in the Pays de Gex in France and find housing much more reasonable.  You don't say what your budget or housing needs are (house, garden, etc.?).  Divonne is probably the priciest place in the Pays de Gex, but there are lots of small communities that are accessible and pleasant.

Our big one is a Barb Easy 570 (bigger model) but just the basic one without all the frills and is maybe 7 or 8 years old so not current and the other one is the smallest model, also just the basic model. It doesn't seem to work as well as the big one but still does the job. 
I never clean the inside the cone except from chipping the big stuff off about twice a year with a wooden spoon, as they are designed to smoke/flavour the meat as it cooks. If you leave them on full they will smoke but turn it down a little and it hardly causes smokes and at say 2/3 setting or lower doesn't smoke at all. They cook very efficiently and dont need to be on full except for the first 10mins or so.  
Not cheap but have come down in price since we bought ours all those years ago.    "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Apr 2008	Groaned at 94 Times in 72 Posts	Where to buy a smokeless grill	Jaro	Posts: 1,319

			Ski gear for adults and kids - we got some really cheap gear ($50 for German brand suits) at one of the GSIS fairs.  Or for adults there's a place in Johnston Rd Wan Chai, just down from The Pawn, next door to Wan Kee Sports.  Right at the back (behind a wall) there's Helly Hansen, Jack Wolfskin, etc.  And they also have heaps of biking gear for winter, and fleeces, etc.  Really cheap compared to here.  We also got some ski gear at Stanley market.   
Raincoats - not warm ones, but just for wet cool days.   
Agree with the curtains, but check if your house has shutters that you can use.  If it does you may not need block out curtains, just sheers.   
You wont need your dehumidifyers in the house but we use one in our basement as it does get damp down there, and when it's raining we dry the washing with it.   
Rugs - particularly if you can go to SZ.   
Ceiling lights - if you house needs them.  Much, much cheaper in HK (and much funkier).   
As to food, some Asian stuff is here, but some is hard to find or you have to travel around to get it.  Also I'd stock up on vanilla essence, brown sugar (although I'm not sure if you want to ship that - maybe in sealed containers?) and golden syrup.     
DVDs - much wider range of english DVDs in HK.   
We only moved a few months ago so I'll see if I can think of anything else that we brought or wish we'd brought.

What size suitcase(s) are you looking for? What is your budget? We are near Baden and our attic looks like a luggage shop. Send me a PM with some idea of what you are looking for and how much you are looking to spend. Who knows, we might have something used that meets your needs. If you are looking to buy brand new, Manor has a decent selection of suitcases.

			Hey guys,   
Does anybody know if there are any pubs around (I will go almost ANYWHERE) that will be showing the NRL finals. I just found out that the Broncos are going to (hopefully beat) play the Storm this Saturday. Pretty exciting if you are a fan of Israel Folau.   
I had a look in the searches and they all seemed to be about how you can watch it on the internet, if at all. So any help would be super appreciated. Probably timed quite badly though, almost all the Australians in Europe are at Oktoberfest right now.   
Any ideas?

			Hello   
does anyone know of gallery or service similar to  . 
I'd like something to put on my wall but with a little more flexibility than just ordering a poster online. 
Basically what I'm after is the possibility to select from a wide range of motives (mountains), black/white vs. color and decide on format and frame. I know, it sounds just like allposters but I'd like to be able too see the thing and get a feel for it before I decide, and not just do it all online.   
Any advice from the photographers on the forum how to go about getting a nice, large, framed photograph up on the wall?   
Also, what alternatives to drilling a hole, are there when it comes to hanging. Not sure I'm allowed to go crazy with power drill, where I live.   
Many thanks 
/C

6328	19.09.2009, 08:15	Forum Veteran	Thanked 3,567 Times in 1,359 Posts	Location: Vaud	"      There seem to be a number of issues relating to printing and various applications such as MS office 2008 having problems. I'm also hearing reports of vastly reduced battery life on laptops.   
That said I'm running it on my MacBook at the moment and it seems OK, but then again I'm not pushing it beyond web browsing, email etc. On my main machine, an iMac, I'm still running 10.5.8, and will be until Snow Leopard is at least at 10.6.2, and I've fully tested it on my MacBook.   
Advantages, or improvements are thin on the ground as far as the user experience is concerned. The vast majority of changes are under the hood, and a few subtle changes in some of the user interface elements. It does seem a lot snappier than plain old Leopard, but I wouldn't consider this reason enough to upgrade at the moment.   
My pet theory is that Apple are using this rewrite of the system to get 3rd party firms to release 64bit drivers and applications, and to gradually encourage users to switch over while ironing out the problems before the next major release. It's basically a big beta IMO which in my mind is reflected by the upgrade cost - 40CHF. Normally big system upgrades are considerably more expensive.

I know because I came here for grad school and had to jump through the appropriate hoops to get my (accredited) US degrees recognized as the equivalent of proper Swiss ones.

			I tried riding fixed for a week but, gave it up as a bad job, firstly its a mare going down hill with the brakes on so you dont pop your pelvis out and secondly, had a car turn in on me at a junction and instinctively tried to freewheel. Needless to say i had a close inspection of the tarmac! Each to there own though.   
That picture on the website is a bit missleading, the whole shop is about 35m2 and 1/3 is a workshop. Still, ther serivice was top notch.   
Most hills round my way are around 1 in 6 and i can ride up without too much trouble. Tried a 1 in 5 (in parts) and was breathing out of my arse. I guess conditioning will help.   
I bought it really for a maintenance free (as much as possible) commuter/beater bike but, having ridden it nigh-on 40k to zurich and back sunday am for a paper, i can see it being used more than i anticipated. I only bought an entry level bowery, the higher end ss/fg must feel fantastic.   
Definitely worth a go if you get chance and have decent terrain.    
Cheers.

			Saw a good tip on a house-cleaning TV programme recently:   
Fill a jar halfway with a sweet vinegar (cider or similar) add just a couple of drops of washing up liquid and put a sheet of ripped cling wrap over the top.   
The flies are attracted by the sweet vinegar because it smells a bit like rotting fruit, fly in through the gaps in the cling wrap, the washing up liquid breaks the surface tension of the vinegar and the flies drown.   
Change it daily.

			Glad to see that you have found some of the Info you needed.   
One of the problems with multiple questions on multiple themes, is that anyone who answers has to quote that part of your text so that you know which bit is being referred to.    
Markalex has replied to your 'car' questions, but questions about permits and medical insurance are still 'open' and people who know the answers may not realise that.    
I know that the answers on the Forum are often confusing, sometimes even contradicting each other too, but I believe Jenny is our Medical Insurance Expert, so have a look at her posts  in that section and see if you find a relevant reply there.   
Good Luck.

			If you visit a doctor, you will be billed for the visit.  I have done this once and it was around 70 CHF.  You send your invoices to the insurance company and once you are over your deductible (hopefully never), you will get money back.  It may seem like you are paying a lot, but just remember that in Canada, you are paying, it's just being taken off with your taxes (which are lower here).  I'm not trying to imply that I like paying my insurance, but I do understand why we pay.

6362	09.09.2008, 18:05	Forum Legend	Thanked 2,856 Times in 1,550 Posts	Location: Zürich	"    As I wrote, the red doe is called ""Hirschkuh,"" and, if there is a need to emphasize the sex of the stag, since ""Kuh"" means ""cow,"" he is called ""Hirschbulle."" There may be regional deviations from this, though.    
Please note that in German the grammatical gender of ""Hirsch"" is masculine (""der Hirsch""). That's why you needn't necessarily append the bull part.    
A very old-fashioned word for ""Hirschkuh"" is ""Hinde"" or ""Hindin,"" by the way. You may find it in old books, but definitely not at the butcher's.    
It's  species. In Europe, ""Hirsch"" is either Cervus elaphus or (rarely) Dama dama (fallow deer). ""Reh"" is Capreolus capreolus.

			I was walking around the Pfäffikersee today and spotted these gorgeous flowers. What made me think that they were special was that they had no leaves. The form reminded me of Crocuses and the color was a delicate lilac/pale purple/mauve. The stems were milky white and look like they would leak sap if you even brushed against them.   
It bugged me that I didn't know what they were and I asked an elderly pair sat on a bench for some information. They were Herbstzeitlose, I was chuffed to find that out because it was also one of my favorite Swiss films.   
It's the little things in life that make you smile.

			Thanks for all the ideas.  There's a few more places for me to try now.      Yes, you see people wearing them everywhere.  I think I was just a week or two late before all the big shops stopped selling them and brought out their winter stuff.

I could only suggest to have digitec send it and you pay for it in cash at the post office (there's a surcharge), or pick your order up in person. Digitec has a location in Winterthur I think.

			The laptop I'm using now was bought in the states about 2 years ago and I'm just sorry I didn't buy two.   
As for the keybd, I like to use a separate Swiss keyboard and mouse anyway. Sometimes, even a separate monitor, it's easier on the body.   
It's a low performance model by HP/Compaq, but it's fine for most things one does on a laptop. I had a small problem that I contacted HP about and was surprised that the response came the next day in English - from Schleiren, CH! Anyway, the ""US"" warranty was never an issue.   
As for customs, we were traveling as a family and as far as I know, we each had 375.SFr allowance (x4). The laptop was 400.USD. I didn't have a problem there either.   
At the time, that was under 500.SFr, which is even TODAY, not a bad price for an 15.4inch, HP laptop.   
Of course the OS is in English, which you may or may not want, but you may have to pay extra for in CH.   
I've never had a problem with the power supply, except for having to change the cable end plug.   
Not everything or everyplace is a bargin in the states though and you still need to shop around. If you can find a Fry's Superstore, I would highly recommed going there.

			The difference is Voltage.   
US - 110Volts 60 Hz 
Europe - 240Volts 50Hz.   
In the US, you can buy some applicances that use 240Volts.  This is often kitchen appliances.  Someone posted in another thread a place in the US that sells 240Volt appliances at a lower price than you can buy them here.   
Plus many things have power supplies designed for both voltages (auto sensing) like:   
Phone chargers, camera chargers, laptops etc... (but obviously double check first).   
PS3 also has a dual voltage power supply. So pick up a nice new Slim one (at least the Fat PS3 was dual voltage as I have a US one which unfortunately has a duff BD Drive  ).   
If it won't work with 240Volts, then leave it behind.  You can get step-down transformers but unless this is something you can't live without/replace then not worth it.

			Thanks everyone for your replies.  I went to the post office yesterday and found out the flat rate boxes are super small, not large enough for cloths, maybe for a few books etc.   
A normal size packing box (20x20x10) weighing no more than 20lbs will cost about $115 if you want a tracking #.  Can be as low as $80 without a trackking # but personally i think the extra cash is worth it to know where your stuff is.

			Just you know that I finally got one adelivered today from t amazon.fr for 65 with a delivery address in Saint Louis, less than 10kms from where I live in CH! For the identical article in CH, the lowest was 169 S.Fr and the highest was 214 chf. List price at Meccano official site in CH is 199 chf.    
Nevertheless, I can't understand the pricing in CH for this toy and also for kapla toys are unreasonably higher than across the border! Do anyone know why?              "	considered unworthy	Join Date: Apr 2007	Groaned at 8 Times in 7 Posts	Where can I buy Meccano Toys online?	Ashish	Posts: 258

			Thank you so much!    
hearing about the outrageous Swiss prices for clothing I arrived in CH with so many extra clothes for my son (that he will slowly grow into) that I didn't even go to a kids' clothing store in the past year    
now of course I have a little crisis situation because I have no idea where to get even the most basic stuff ...   
but thanks to all of you the grim scenario of my son showing up in a potato sack on the first day of school is less likely!!

			The SBB-themed items are sold in the Reisebüro, if you haven't found them yet. When you go to reserve international tickets, and have to wait for centuries with a little ticket in your hand, you will see all the Tshirts and watches, etc lined up there in glass cases. The Reisebüro is across the great hall from the Migros, direction tracks 1-3.

it comes with a great view.    
regarding accommodation: why don't you suggest the guests to pay themselves? This is what we had done and it was accepted. No one  
expects these days that the wedding couple or their parents pay for everything. Especially not, when you are expecting a little new member of the family.    
It's the occassion not the all-inclusive-concept...

			It doesn't matter where you bought it. Last year, I had a problem with my HP, I called the customer service in Canada since I bought mine there and they gave me the number in switzerland.    
They came to pick up my laptop and send it back to me after.    
This year, I had an other problem with my laptop      
I called them again and because I was going to Canada for one month and I was scared to not get it on time, I had both option to get my laptop fixed here or in Canada.

Anyway, pretty sure Ive just got the basic health insurance, and it was no problem to get it done arthroscopically.  I got a CT scan and MRI scan of it done within a week, where they couldnt really detect much damage. (Amazing since Id buggered quite a few things in there!!!)  It was when I went back for a review and the surgeon asked why I was limping the way I did (huummm because its very sore !!) that he said he would operate on it. In fact he asked me if I would like it done that afternoon !!! I settled for two days later.  See what your orthopaedic doc says, then check with your insurance carrier.

The Zug International Women's Club has two weekly English-speaking ""Stammtische"" (sorry) in Zug and has done so for 40 years.  . (Parkhotel, Wednesday mornings and evenings).   
The Zug International Men's Club has a weekly English-speaking Stammtisch in Zug and has done so for 30 years.  . (Parkhotel, Thursday evenings, 18:00 - 20:00).   
While it's true that it's not free to join these non-profit organizations, it really is cheap on an annual basis.   
The Zug International Business Forum has monthly (primarily) English-language networking events in Zug and has done so since the beginning of the year.  . (Dates/venues vary).

			When I bought a laptop in CH the Vista Buisness setup disc had English as an option. Along with a few other languages. I think only XP has the install disc in only 1 language...   
As for other netbooks that come with Linux, you can download an English version and install it:       
Or any other Linux distro here:       
...the great thing with Linux is that it's not only multi-lingual, but also free

There are lots of reasons Swiss women work part-time. School schedules are a huge contributing factor as are the difficulties of getting child care (at a reasonable price).   
Not making judgements, there are very good reasons for Switzerland being structured as it is, however the set up makes it difficult to have two full time working parents. This may be a good thing or not.   
Question of the day: What percentage of Swiss men are the stay at home care giver?   
 A comparison of this number across countries would give me an idea of sexual equality in society

So at the moment, you're connecting the colours individually via component. Try the Composite input (which is a single photo/RCA socket normally coloured yellow)--your digital camera or DVD player may have a composite out. If you still have the same issue, then I'd say it's something inside...    
Maybe could be a dry joint regarding the circuitry where the colour signals are transmitted. These things do get very hot and something like a dry joint is possible.

			Thanks for the tips!   
FYI, I have ordered the Apple Airport Express.  The SqueezeBox does 
most of what I would like to do... except control via iTunes.  Sure the 
WiFi remote is pretty impressive, my computers are on 24/7 and control 
via iTunes is my preference.     
On top of that, my Bose system (with two speaker locations) is still 
adjustable via the remote, within 150 meters and through walls.  Plus,  
the new iPhone that should arrive soon offers the ""Remote"" app which  
acts as an Airport Express & iTunes remote when connected to the WLAN.

			Hi Daregoat 
I agree with the other posters, you'll mostly likely pay customs duty when you receive it along and also added hassle of fixing your computer when the seller is from another country.   
Buy one here, its much easier, I would rather pay more for peace of mind   Good luck!

			Hi,   
The name of these guys is ""Wandergeselle"" which translates as ""journeyman"".    
Basically it's time-served craftsmen - brickies, carpenters etc - who travel about gaining experience in their trade by doing jobs in exchange for food and accommodation.   
Here is an article about them:       
Cheers,

			Don't forget there's always the Ikea option which isn't too far from you.  We had a few items sent over which were inherited from my father in law - transport was very expensive and we had to pay VAT because the transport company said it was difficult to prove that the furniture was exempt.  Still its nice to have it.   
What about driving back to UK for a little holiday yourself?

The large pain in the hole comes at the check-out when you are randomly picked for a full re-scan then your perfectly packed shopping is then strewn all over the conveyor belt   .

			The last place I worked here had two paid breaks per day. At breaktime, which was 9am and 4pm, someone would start the coffee and the kettle and all 10-15 of us would gather in the kitchen. Shortest time was 15 mins, but if a good discussion got going or the boss started telling stories it could go for an hour at times.   
Outside of that, if you wanted a cup of tea or coffee, or a smoke you did it. I think only once did someone get a talking to for abusing the system.   
Coffee and tea were free, bottle water was 1CHF and you threw your coin in a little basket on the honor system.   
I left there 3 years ago, but was back to see the old boss just recently and they still do the same routine.

I do not know if this is the drive in place where your car is weighed going in and weighed again going out, but the cost of dumping everything is very cheap. Where i live in GR i paid 120 sfr to dump 6 trailer and car loads. the weight was approx one ton. Basically what happens is you drive into the factory and just dump everything into this massive container in the ground where the machinery chews any and everything up. Electricity is generated from the byproduct of this.

So I have to get a manual saw and  saw to release the chainsaw. Not as bad as my friend though. She was trying to lop of a branch up a ladder with the chainsaw. She was cutting leaning onto the branch. They all came down together and landed in a bush- Lucky she didn't cut her head off! Oh well live and learn.  I have an obsession with cutting trees at present. I try to pull the ones I've cut deeper into the wood, but the piles are getting massive. I got the really big ones cut professionally today- 70 years old white pines, which the birds loved, I feel so guilty-all to improve a lawn, that no-one uses. 
At least I learned from a very irate parent bird not to trim hedges during nesting season.

			Hi all,   
Since I have time on my hands at the moment and have had enough of German classes, I've been thinking of auditing some management courses at the ETH or University of Zürich. Has anyone here any feedback on auditing courses at these institutions?   
Or more specifically on the following courses?   
351-0425-00 Transformation: Corporate Development & IT 
351-0301-00 HR Management: Work Process Design 
351-0389-00 Technology & Innovation Management   
Thanks, 
Nick

			Hey Kayser,    
From what I understand from the Swiss academic system the open university qualifications may not be recognised, not like they are in the UK. This information was gleened from a conversation with a Prof at Zurich Uni, so you may want to check it out before signing up for expensive distance learning, which of course you pay a higher premium for because youre not in the UK.    
Also worth noting that the lower degrees Bachelors & Masters tend to be a all part of the process of studying. These are usually taught in German (if coming from German speaking part of Switzerland) and change to English at PhD level. This again my be my field specific so just may be worth finding out about by contacting academics in your area. Find the best prof in your area of study, who works in Switzerland and send him a mail, usually found on his personal webpage. They teach it, so they will be best to advise.    
Just a thought as Im rambling... if you are British, the British Council might have information for you on courses.    
Best of luck with your search

			For events that are strictly limited to numbers (I often have them for max 12 people) I always PM or e-mail and get a confirmation 2 days before (and I always give them my handy number to call on the day if they have to cancel) - for these type of events, I've never had a problem.    
If it's unlimited in numbers I don't worry, those that say they are coming and don't are usually outnumbered by those who don't say they are coming and do!

The Swiss will only deliver it this side as instructed by the UK post and won't have anything to do with your choice of postal service.

6521	05.06.2006, 07:28	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Geneva	   Dear Desiensus,               Pet hate of mine, people who drive SUVs. My eldest son was waiting at traffic-lights last year when he was rear-ended by some stupid woman who just didnt see him; she was looking over the top of the car he was driving, to the one at the front of the queue! Fortunately he was driving his girlfriends Daihatsu at the time and not his precious Mini, hes the perfect English gentleman most of the time, but if shed damaged Myrtle, hed probably have made dog-meat out of the stupid ******.               Seriously though, our roads are quite narrow, the parking spaces mean (in size, its the traffic wardens that are mean-spirited), Hubby says theyre usually 2 metres 50 x 4 metres and the underground car-parks can be pretty tight, often only 2 metres 70 high. A lot of parallel parking too, something Im told some americans find hard to get used to.    It is possible to lease a car for a short while, perhaps that might be worth doing while you decide exactly which region youll be living in and whether you actually need two cars.   I managed for over twenty years without one in Geneva, we lived in Carouge (just outside the city), and the centre of town was only a ten minute tram ride away. The infant and junior schools were just down the road, as were the shops. My husband usually walked to work, so we only really used the car at week-ends.   A tram/bus ticket costs Chf 3 for an hour or Chf 10 for a 24 hour pass (7 if you get it after 9am) and you can use your ticket to cross over the Rade (city harbour) on the little shuttle-boats, which always impresses visitors.   Get a good map, theres a great one out now called Plan Officiel de Genève with the public transport system marked on it, and most of the buildings; including the hospitals, post offices and cop-shops. It costs about CHF26 and has the maps on a CD as well. It pretty well covers the whole of the Canton. You should find it in one of the larger book shops in town, FNAC or Payot. Possibly Naville at the airport.   Most of the doctors can speak some English, especially the younger ones. The same goes for shop assistants and bar staff. It does help if you make a bit of an effort though, some of the older people can be quite xenophobic and youll need some basic french to read the instructions posted everywhere. This is Switzerland after all; there are rules to be obeyed! I have met people that know theyre only in Geneva for a couple of years so theyre content just to live in their expensive ghettos communities and dont make any effort to mix (Im afraid that americans are particularly well know for this), but it does seem a shame not to join in and learn something about where youre living.               About the permit, Mark is right; dont assume youll get a good one just because youre in management, apart from anything else, giving you a lowly one means its easier to get rid of you! Cant help about the pros and cons of L permits though, never heard of them! Been here too long, clearly the systems changed a bit since 1979.               Theres an American International Womens Club and American Citizens Abroad listed in the local phone book and Im sure the Consulate, 7 Rue Versonnex, can supply you with info about other clubs, churches and political thingies if youre interested.               If youre in Geneva on the 17th, then enjoy the music festival thats on all weekend (it can get a bit noisy, be warned) and try to pick up pick up some free immobilier magazines from the distributors along the streets (usually near the bus stops), thatll help you get an idea of whats available and how much youll need to spend!  	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jun 2006	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Can I work in Geneva and live in France?	desiensus	Posts: 4

However, there was already once a 'private' film night on Sundays, but the guy organising it had to be exceptionally careful to make sure it wasn't for, er, profit, as the film companies tend to come down like a ton of bricks on independent cinemas, even if you're showing some old DVD.

			OK, it has been a couple of weeks since we rented a camper van, but I just wanted to give you guys a quick feedback.  I found the fellow to be very uncomplicated, the campervan was super (it had rained most of the weekend) so all in all a good experience.  I can defnitely recommend these guys!  Thanks for all your help!

			A few responses to the posts above:   
*Marine aquariums are as difficult as many people think and not any noisier.  It is more expensive to setup than fresh but it's an entirely different hobby, IMO.  I keep both FW and SW tanks.   
*You can have plants with cichlids, it just depends on what type of cichlids you keep CA/SA/WA/EA.   
Crumbs, 
Those fish are cichlids from West Africa, in particular the Nigeria region.  They go by the common names of Kribensis, Kribs, etc.  Scientific name is Pelvicachromis pulcher, a very prolific fish.  Those fish can be kept with most plants and display very beautiful coloration when in breeding dress.   
Egla, 
Malawian cichlids dig up the substrate quite a bit so having planted plants with them isn't a good idea.  Plus, there are very few plants found in their natural habitat.  They have a very rocky environment with specific water conditions that are very hard with a high pH. BTW, the word for those who keep aquariums is aquarist not aquariumists.    
Owls_79, 
Microgeophagus ramirezi (German Rams) are one of my all-time favorite species and I used to breed them quite regularly.   
If you're interested, I can post some shots of my fish/tanks.  I've kept quite a few species and various setups.  Or if anyone here needs assistance with their current tank setups or wants some advice in setting up a tank feel free to PM me or start a thread that I can reply to.  I can give you some tips on how to save $, or rather CHF when starting out.   
Tip #1: Buy sand or very small pebble mixtures from your local hardware store instead of the pet store.  Here in Halifax I can buy a 20kg bag of playsand (safe for freshwater aquariums) for $4 as opposed to the same amount at a pet store for $60-80.

6553	25.06.2009, 19:30	Senior Member	Thanked 19 Times in 17 Posts	Location: Biel/Bienne	"    Swiss plugs are so simple and cheap (1Fr.) change them yourself.        
The BRAUN cable is positive (it could also be RED or BLACK) 
The BLUE cable is negative. 
The YELLO-GREEN is earth.   
If you are not staying long in Switzerland, I would bring an extention cable with a block of say 5 english sockets on it and change only the ext. cable plug. 
Hope this helps.

			A few questions for this thread:   
1) What are the prices for getting t-shirts printed in the stores mentioned above?  
2) Is there a minimum number of pieces one must order?  
3) Do they also supply the t-shirts or must we bring our own? 
4) Are the T-shirts of good quality? i.e the collar should not loosen after 2 washes!   
I only know of one printer online:       
Happy printing.

			Greetings all,   
When I moved to Zürich 3 months ago, I sent my cargo with DHL from Kenya. It cost only 500 US dollars for 100 kilos. Very worth it and I got it in a couple of days. Since it was personal effects, I didn't pay any fees, duties or taxes.   
I picked it up from the Cargo terminal at the airport myself. If you want it delivered to your doorstep, it costs another 300-500 dollars. Pick it up yourself.   
If you are taking sports equipment with you, I know airlines give you an extra allowance. Check it out with them.   
ciao ciao

			Hi Ovaltine,   
I went to Les Roches, it is an outstanding school in a beautiful location, with an excellent syllabus and brilliant professors. The name is very well known around the world and in my opinion, it offers better practical experience than Cornell, which is important for a Hotel Career.       
Lausanne used to be a sister school to Les Roches, don't know if it is any more, but also an excellent institution.   
For Culinary Arts, I would highly recommend Cordon Bleu in Paris.  
Very Very good and well reputed.     
PM me if you would like more details.

			Dear all,   
I am looking to host an interactive event for around 30-40 people in Berne on the weekend of 15/16 August. However, not living in the city, I have no familiarity with it ... so was wondering if y'all might be able to help with suggestions.   
What I am looking for is a space in which to do group work (no tables needed, chairs yes, and preferably mats or even carpet on the floor as it will involve lying/sitting/working on the floor) ... it would be for two sessions of approximately two hours each in duration (one in the morning, one in the afternoon) each day (that might necessitate a full day rental of the space, which is fine).   
Any suggestions that people have for suitable locations, and contact details, much appreciated!

			Hi-  
well re price- how long is a piece of string? 
Over near Lake Geneva  , in Grandvaux ,a plot  might cost over CHF 1 million, however a little further away from the lake land is still available for around CHF 100/m2. So as they say its all down to location.. Check out   or   for prices and availability. Building well that also depends on location as parts of valais are coming to a standstill I believe, however one of my friends had a beautiful chalet built ( on the land at CHF100/m2) and I think it took about a 8 mths-a year in total. She did have an architect managing it. There are loads of older properties around going relatively cheap if you are into restoring. In the Lac Leman hinterland you can pick up an old farm with a decent bit of land for   CHF500,000- CHF 750,000- would need lots of work done.

			Weasels are very popular in France to be kept as a pet.  
A few weeks ago I met someone in the French part of Switzerland who went for a walk ""avec son furet"", with his weasel.  
I asked him all about what it was like to keep such an animal at home and if it had become popular in Switzerland too. There aren't too many yet apparently.

			Thanks Swisspea for the extendable idea - I need to have a closer look to see if that is the case with the bed frame we bought. Right now we have all three mattresses flat on the base.  
Not convinced ease of washing is the answer....

They were the local partner chosen by the overseas firm we had decided upon. Unfortunately it was not up to us to choose the local partner. It was the worst move I can recall and having moved more times than I can count on both hands, I do have a basis for comparison. We had a better experience with Crown. We had used them once before a few years back and they did a fantastic job packing and shipping a 40 foot high cube leaving Switzerland. Unfortunately things did not go as well on the other side of the world, but that was entirely the fault of the local office. What you want to be certain of, is that regardless of which firm you use,  that both offices are on the same page and when there are problems, they don't disown them locally.

			How about you contact the school and ask the direction? In international schools, teachers (and students) tend to stay for only a few years before moving on to another school (I work in one in Vaud myself at the moment). But the directors would probably stay for a longer time and the 1990s is not a long time ago.

Is there another office store that is cheaper? Like Staples?  
As I am looking at a 2-3 drawer filing cabinet!.. Know where i could find one... I looked at Office World website but it seems expensive. 
Perhaps this is just the Swiss way!!?! 
Thanks so much

Being a rock-star does not concern me, just strumming a few chords, belting out a few well written tunes and playing the occasional gig is what it’s all about. The title ‘singer song writer’ is not the perfect description of what I’m about because what I do is rocky and upbeat with a very slight hint of Ireland.      I’ve been playing on and off with a few Swiss lads but I’d also really like to try something new and to play with another English speaker would be gift!!

The colour of the sofa bed is the lightest cream shade and there were absolutely no marks on it when we got it so we figured it hadn't been a demo model for very long (if it had, it would have been a bit grubby).  My husband is a bit of a scary negotiator and managed to get the extra discount without too much difficulty when perhaps they wouldn't really have given in so easily.   
Having said all that, it is a pretty robust model and is extremely well made so I wasn't expecting it to fall apart too easily.

Technically, any internationally recognized notary could do this, and it would be legally binding.  However, you never know if the authorities requesting it would give you a hard time with anything other than a US notary.  I had to do this once, and decided to avoid potential problems and have it done by the US notary.

			It's perfectly doable! However there are some cheaper and some more expensive venues which depends not only on the location. I'm sorry to say that but in Zurich the pubs where some of the English speaking expats tend to gather are among the more expensive places.   
It's however also possible to burn through 1.5kCHF a month on night-outs alone without buying any food except the anti-hangover kebabs...   
If you want to stay on the safe side, start your first night-outs with mineral water and work your way up to beer and the 12 years old single malt from under the counter as you gain experience...

3) Can keep the clothes there for 1-2 month before picking them up. Even better if they have a large storage room to store the clothes, before pick up. 
4) Is reasonably priced.

			Thanks for your suggestion and your time!  
I also considered this after no one volunteered, but I am happy to have received feedback bec. I lack experience in this. 
I agree that it would be best to do it so.   
That is a good tip. I will look at Ebay and Ricardo to see how the prices range.

			Hi, 
I'm living with a Swiss family that speaks French and Swiss German at home, as well as English with me. I'm taking German classes.   
I'm looking to find/buy some kid's cassettes/cds that are bi-lingual.  Songs etc to help me learn German.  We have some that are French-English but would love to find some German-English ones.  Has anyone anything to recommend? 
Thanks 
Kylie

A friend of mine is keen to come over from England and do the Lausanne triathlon at the end of August. Does anyone know if it is possible to rent a bike anywhere in Lausanne for the day/weekend for this purpose?

			I recently got a delivery quote for GBP 600 for delivery and installation of a dining table & chairs and a dresser from Luker Brothers.  
We too are going to take advantage of the Zimbabwean GBP and buy some great furniture at a good price in the UK. (Alan Cryer furniture to be precise).  
Just to correct an earlier poster, Swiss furniture in my opinion (gained after many fruitless hikes around empty furniture stores persued by desperate managers / salespeople) is over-priced and shiite. Furniture for the home should not look like it might injure you, should contain as little brushed aluminium / zebra striped leather / bright red upholstery as possible, and should not fit in perfectly in your local A&E ward.   
Cheers   
Jim

			I was in a chemist looking for the same recently. Berocca was nearly 30.- for a canister or 70.- for a 100 pack. I almost choked with laughter.    
solution: cross road, go to Aldi, buy no-name cheap fizzy tabs there. They work fine (contain same ingredients as ""name-brands"". I feel great and they cost about 2.- per canister.    
I do my best to shop strategically and eat healthy but the majority of prices in switzerland are ridiculous!                "	slipped a little	Join Date: May 2009	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Effervescent tablets- Berroca, Supradyn > Migros ones?	Swine	Posts: 56

			Hi Sash   
I couldn't tell you what the reputation of the private business schools are like in Switzerland, but the general standard of education here seems to be quite high anyway.    
If you're still looking at Fachhochschulen, I will be attending an English language programme this Fall at the Hochschule Luzern which was introduced last year. Its the only undergraduate programme entirely in English undergrad which I have found at a university or a Fachhochschule in Switzerland. Hope this helps you.

			Hi Folks,   
I'm brand new to the forum, and decided to join after seeing some of the great threads.   
I was in the process of archiving old analog reel to reel tapes to digital when my Revox tape machine decided to conk out!  A full recondition is too expensive at this point, and buying on e-bay is hit or miss, so I wondered if anyone knew a studio that can do this for me, or where I could rent a machine.  I live close to Geneva.   
Any help would be much appreciated.   
By the way, I'm using Audacity which is free software for my PC, and seems to work quite well.  Just in case anyone was thinking of doing something similar.   
Thanks, Baz.

			Thanks guys for the replies.   
Since you guys are recommending having a car, i wanted to find out if anyone has shipped their var from US to Switzerland. I am guessing the car would leave from Sanfran/LA to somewhere in france and then driven to switzerland.    
Questions i have: 
a) is it a good idea to ship, has anyone here done it? 
b) do i have to pay tax/duties in france 
c) do i have to pay tax/duties in switzerland. 
d) how about emissions etc, is there any need to do any modifications to meet swiss standards.   
thnx.

			I replaced the regulator on our Aussie BBQ (Jackaroo brand) last month and it was pretty straightforward. The regulator and hoses are sold seperately so you'll need to buy both, but the connector where the the hose joins the BBQ is identical to the Australian one so no problems there. One thing to note; at our local Coop Bau + Hobby the regulators came in two different flow rates, and we needed to get the larger one. It doesn't let quite as much gas through but it's close enough.

I've never been charged customs entry fee by anyone outside on the EU or within the EU. So this was a first for me...and a last too.   
Oh, I went to Royal Mail's website and it states there that shipping to Europe (Switzerland included in their list) was less than 7 GBP for 1 to 1.5 kg parcel. So here I am wondering why I'm being charged three times more. Customs entry fees? Fine, give me a link that states the rates and stuff. So far, I've got nothing from the HM Customs site or Royal Mail's site...or maybe I wasn't looking hard enough. Eh.

			Hi there, I am hoping that someone out there can help me. We live in a house that has a 6 metre round above ground (one foot above ground the rest is sucken in) swimming pool. It has a cover which doesn't do the job that it is intended to do. When it rains/ snows the weight of the water causes the cover to sink into the pool - hence the pool get very dirty. I am looking for a replacement cover for it but I do not seem to be having any luck with it. Is there anyone out there that has a cover for their pool that can suggest a company for me to use. I have also heard that you can get covers that take the weight of a small child / pets should - maybe these are called safety covers. Looking at getting the pool ready so we can use it in this lovely weather! I look forward to hearing from you.

			I had my bike stolen once in Switz. A nice Cannondale - I was lucky to get it back but only by a million to one chance (long story). I was checking out Ebay France, Germany & Italy in the days before I found it.   
The police will not really look out for it that is for sure, but you can claim back the insurance in some cases. I actually found my bike when I went on the hunt to find out how much they cost over here for insurance purposes.   
I also lost my snowboards and they were stolen from my basement (the cave). Full refund.... I don't know about how it works from being taken in the street, but there are ways to claim back. Anyway, the insurance is the best way forward for you and you wont need to stress anymore if you get some moolah to buy a replacement.   
Hope that works for you and I feel your pain.

			To install a washing mashine you need a water connection, a waste connection and what is missing up to now, electric. Most mashines need 1x380 volt and  that is found almost only in the kitchen, in flats (cooking plates etc.) . 
If I was you, I would mesure the kitchen eliments and if you have one next to the sink which is 60cm wide, take it out and put the wash mashine in its place. (Most wash mashines are 60 wide, 56 deep and 84 high.) 
If your kitchen is not more than 15 years old it should be no problem. 
Take a photo of the kitchen with you and ask "" Fust"" for an offer.

			Hi everybody,       is having a special offer. You can get a free mousepad, free prints, a photoposter and something else that i do not remember now. All that you have to do is go to the website, and clic on the right side by the place that says LA ROUE EXTRAFILM ( in french) or EXTRAFILM GLUCKSRAD ( in german). Everybody has the chance to win.    
A new page will open and you will need to put in your email addres, spin the wheel ( i needed to do it twice) and you will get your price.    
We won a mouse pad for free ( i only have to pay the shipping, like usual) 
and some others friends to whom we told about the offer won the same price and others the free poster or free prints.    
By the way i can recommend the photoprinting service, photos are good quality and service is quick.    
If you need some extra help, just let me know !!

This didn't happen here in Switzerland but I've heard of a guerrisseur here in NE to whom people go, like very early in the morning.

			First, hello to all!  And, thanks to EVERYONE, from the site developers/founders to the posters, for making such an excellent and informative site!   
Basically, I have a few questions about the management programs at ETH Zurich and EPFL.  And, having searched through the previous posts in this forum, it appears that several members are/were affiliated with these programs in one way or another.  However, I was unable to find the specific information that I am looking for.  Therefore, I am hopeful that some of you can help me out.   
----- 
A bit about me (possibly irrelevant): 
I am presently finishing up my PhD in Neuroscience and Interdisciplinary Biomedical Studies from a US medical school (I'm a US citizen, BTW), with a research focus more along the lines of molecular biology or molecular neuroimmunology.  And, I have recently concluded that I would like to conduct my postdoctoral studies in Switzerland.     
At this point, I have not yet fully decided upon a lab or fellowship to which I would like to apply.  However, in my searches of the various universities and research institutes, I became intrigued by the possibility of attending either the ETH Zurich Msc. program in Management, Technology and Economics or the EPFL Msc. program in Management of Technology and Entrepreneurship, while conducting my postdoctoral studies (after the first year).  Both of these programs would fit in well with my long-term career goals: either starting my own biotech company or working my way into the management of an existing one in order to have a greater degree of influence over their research goals (at least to some degree). 
-----   
Along these lines, my questions for individuals who have attended or are attending these programs are:   
What is your typical school week like?  How many classes do you typically have per day, how many hours per day, etc.?  Ultimately, I would like to know if it would even be possible to schedule such school work into my postdoctoral studies... research is generally pretty flexible regarding the hours (i.e. I can probably shift my work to before or after the classes), but that probably wouldn't be the case if the in-class hours are upwards of 40-hours per week.   
And, what is the typical work week like during the internship period?  40-hours per week, 20-hours per week, etc.?  (for the same reason)   
One reason that I would like to find this out now is that, if it would not work out, then that would eliminate the influence of these programs over my current job search location bias.  And, if they could work out, then I would like to make perfectly clear to my potential employers, up front, of my intention to pursue application to/enrollment in these programs while concurrently conducting my postdoctoral research (which may be a different problem altogether, but one that may work with at least one of the potential employers).   
To be clear: I have not yet applied to work anywhere, but am currently biased in my job search locations due to the aforementioned reasons (e.g. I would not want to work in Berne, if there is a possibility that I would eventually have to commute everyday to Lausanne (even more so if I would have to be in Lausanne 6 to 8-hours per day, without regard to the commute); and, likewise, I would not want to eliminate the possibility of working in any particular city with the intention of applying to one of these programs in the future, when attending them would be impossible from the outset).

			I just walked passed the shareholders meeting, never seen so many security guards in one place since I have been here!!   
I was with UBS until recently   speaking to people still there (at the moment) it looks like global wm&bb are going to take a huge hit, and a lot of IT depts are going to be merged.   
Not a good time to work for them, morale was at rock bottom when I left, god knows what its like now!!

			Hi   
On a recent trip to the UK, I noticed that the blessed M&S are offering inclusive 5 year guarantees with their TVs (and their prices are still as good as elsewhere).   
Has anyone noticed in-built guarantees longer than 1 or 2 years in Switzerland (without paying ridiculous yearly 'insurance' premiums)

			Hi everyone,   
Hopefully someone out there has had the same problem...I moved from the UK to Geneva a couple of months ago, and I have only found gas cannisters with a screw connection to the BBQ. However, in the UK, i used to have one which you push down onto the cannister, apparently you cant get them in Switzerland.   
Tried changing the tube from the BBQ, but it is impossible to undo the screw.   
All help appreciated!

			I got a drain cleaner from Coop Bau and Hobby that is a long metal cord that wraps into a handle that you feed into the drain and then twist the handle. Works great. Drain cleaner didn't work.   
As for pond care, my next door neighbour keeps a pond that is full of frogs, algea and fish. Mosquitos breed in it and it stinks in the summer. I have 2 small mill stone ponds that I am forever emptying in the summer when they start to grow things. Cats and birds keep drinking from them and I don't want to kill them.   
You shouln't kill the alge, or you will kill the fish as well, but use alge eating plants to keep it down. Don't let any kind of detergent get to your pond since alge thrives on it.

			Hey Guys and girls. hope this is in the right place now.... 
This is not an advert but have just stayed in a great apartment just 15 minutes on tram from basel.. about halfway betwenn Basel and Lörrach. I was only there for 3 nights but am sure it would be perfect for somebody if they are looking for a room ,not directly in the city but close enough and easy enough to access. Obviously has not been open long as everything looked brand new. Fantastic flat screen television and dvd as well as full kitchen with all mod cons. Even a bath as well as a shower .. which makes a change from the rooms i tend to stay in over here which only have a shower.......Apparently they do long term stays also..i would definately highly recomend it . Was in a nice peaceful location with great country view from living area, For the quality and size of the place was fantastic value for money.... Such a refreshing change from other apartments i have stayed in around this area. Anyway i booked it through booking.com . not sure if they have there own web address but will post the link below.... Just thought might be useful to somebody as i stumbled across it by chance. HAve to say that the pictures really do not do it justice   
Am regularly looking for similar room for short periods of time in zurich if any body can recommend?   
Cheers   
Have a good day people.

			More time to reply properly   
I regularly see these (also in Zürich Affoltern) especially in the weekend evenings between 8.30pm amd 10pm, my wife thinks they are balloons, I have seen them 'take-off' from a forest pretty close to where the ETH is on, is it, Hönggerberg? So I assume it is the science students doing something.

			Hi,Inshan. I always find that the second hand market is really expensive. I was in Le Locle the other day at a cash converter store and was amazed at the price they wanted for some electrical goods. 
The only place that I have been and secured a bargain was at the shop of the American Womans Club, but it was in Geneve. I do not know if you have any such expat sales shop up your way - Possibly in Zurich. The ideal thing is to get a good deal from someone leaving so make sure you check the forum daily.

I think the mums in England (and it wasn't many) were protesting more about the government dictating their daily lives than wanting to feed their kids rubbish.

			I've just remembered another shop where you can get beads. It is located near the tram stop Rennweg. I've bought soapstones and modeling clay that you can put in the oven (""Fimo"") there in the past, but they have many other things. Also beads, I think.

			Hi everybody,   
I am Frederic, French guy living in Switzerland, near Zürich. 
Very fond of photography, being a freelance photographer for many years for big newspapers and magazines, I would like to improve my way of seeing people.    
Basically event photographer, I also did some catalogues for big stores in France. Open for any kind of photography, like fashion, weddings, I will be your next partner and will offer you the full resolution files after shooting. The work can be done indoor, outdoor, at your location (as I don't have any studio at the moment).   
What will it cost you? In a case of a portfolio, nothing, except the right for me to advertise on my website with your pictures. In case of wedding, please contact me: you will be surprised!

Not to spoil the thread but I think the combination of outdoor activity and good cuisine is recommended. I would highly recommend a trip to Girona, Spain, beautiful area for outdoor pursuits and great Spanish cuisine if you like that sort of thing.  There should be plenty of foodie opportunities in the area.    
As far as the 40 theme, 40 km's over 3 days?

			You will usually pay for 2 things   
1. MWST for Switzerland 
2. Service charge 18 CHF for Swisspost   
Sometimes there might be import/custom duty if your shipment contains something requires customs charges. Can not give you more details as I mostly buy things on Ebay for work at University and it is mostly customs free. We just pay tax and service charge.   
If you are buying frequently you might consider opening an account with swiss post. Then you will get a single monthly bill and service charge is 13 CHF instead of 18.       
This page is in English and you will need a copy of your last import bill and payment details to provide as reference.

			The only reason to go to Stauffacher really is that they have bigger selection that Thalia, in Bern at least. I am not that thrilled with their selection, and their prices for paperbacks I wouldn't actually call cheap. But since there isn't anywhere else to go for English books (no, I don't need anyone to recommend Amazon) then Stauffacher it is. I wish they had less ""to be read at the beach"" or ""will be left behind on the plane"" style of books... 
That's my gripe for the day.  
But the staff are very nice and the Reading Circle is interesting.

6774	19.02.2009, 17:26	Forum Legend	Thanked 2,550 Times in 1,236 Posts	Location: Zug canton (calmly in Cham)	"    In the price range discussed here are not many fakes. As you said: Rolex - better be careful, but a fake Oris or Tissot? Hardly...   
And to be honest, the manufacturers warn you not only because they worry that you might get cheated: Their prices vary from country to country in order to keep the end customer price relatively similar while the taxes are differently. As Switzerland has a very low VAT compared to most parts of the EU, you could deduct the 19% in Germany and pay 7.6% here. So instead of bringing the forecasted revenue to the Swiss shops... well you get the point. So better keep people scared... you will find some reseller on ebay that are in the business for quite some time with thousands of transactions and positive feedback. they are very unlikely to cheat you...   
but I second the Manor special offer area. I bought two Tissots there this year as presents for my parents in law for half the regular price...

			Noobee,   
Even though you had an existing structure (which I'm assuming is listed as a Nebenbau on the Katasterplan?), you should first check with your Gemeinde Bauamt to see if you need any kind of permission to rebuild. The question is, are you repairing an existing structure, or building something new? Generally, assuming you build exactly the same thing, on the same spot, covering exactly the same footprint and dimensions, you shouldn't need another permit - but do check first!   
You still might need to chat with your neighbors; if only to appologize in advance for any disruption caused by construction.    
Anyone you hire to should be able to organize dismantling and disposal of the damaged shed. But, you might find it far cheaper to do so yourself.   
And - check with your insurer - you might be covered for the loss or some of the rebuilding costs.   
Afraid I can't help with a builder, but search for hings like 'Gartenhaus' or 'Gerätehaus'. Or even 'Blockhaus'. Both Coop Bau and Hobby and Era carry a line of garden sheds to build yourself (or they can help you find a builder) - you might check their catalog.     
(Just noticed I replied to the original question 2 years ago... I long ago gave up on my dream of a Wintergarten - and I still don't have a permit to build a simple garden shed!   )

I know there are courses by SIZ for Web publishing.   
Maybe this could be an opportunity for what you are looking for.

Hello,   
Are you still looking for the seeds? 
I was also searching for them here myself, but could not find any either  
Now I am having them sent to me from Sweden.  
I am happy to share, just let me know.

I am soon to be leaving Switzerland, and have had trouble tracking down a company that I can ship/post all my crap back to New Zealand with, anyone have any ideas. Basically I am aiming for cheap, and it doesn't matter how long it takes.

			It came to my attention, that the only stuff which self-expires are internet banking standing orders and one has to redefine them every year. I only realised it few days ago as the payment for the flat rent didnt go thru at the end of last month (subject to irritation on the landlord side). As far as the rest is concerned, I heard that one has to give a prior notice, otherwise it will be automatically renewed.

I was returning one of the luggage carts to the stand with my suitcase and travelling bag literally my the side of my leg.One came up to me and asked if I had change but continue walking , so naturally I turned around. In the time that it took to turn back which could not have been more than a few seconds my travelling bag had disappeared.

			I'm in general agreement with the posters answering the OP. Bed prices are absurd in Switzerland. Don't waste your time looking. I bought a top-notch pocket sprung mattress with bum-gripping foam on top from the Atlas furniture warehouse in the big commercial centre north-east of Mulhouse and saved a fortune.

			We had similar problems, a lot of UK companies do not want the hassle of exporting to a non-EU country. We now get all our goods delivered to a UK depot and sent over here on pallets and we arrange the import. We can get the pallets delivered to our door, or to a depot just over the border from us in Austria where we can collect from (it's much cheaper this way).   
Prices vary, but the more pallets you order, the cheaper it is. About SFr. 150 per pallet based on 5 I think, from about 300 for one. One point, the goods have to be put on Euro Pallets (not standard UK ones), the size is 1200x800mm and you can go to about 1800mm tall and up to 600 or 700 Kg I think.   
PM me if you want a contact, they are very professional and helpful.

			As someone else already suggested, talk to your HR contact for a gross-net calculation with every deduction they make directly from the salary as well check with them if the salary is paid in 12, 13 or 14 installments throughout the year. That might affect how you wanna spend the monthly pay.    
For groceries, go the online shops of migro and coop and pick together a ""basket"" of your usual shopping and you get the best idea of the costs. Of course it doesn't provide you with any bargains of late Saturday shopping or super cheap campaignes, but the ordinary prices are usually about the same in the normal shop and the online shop.

re lawsuits? its people like you wanting to sue people that is getting the world into the mess it is

			Just a further update to this posting on this very useful forum.   
Though the ""Do It + Garden""  Migros at Brunaupark was good for wooden shelves and lengths of wood and timber in general it was NOT good for shelving supports/systems.    
You know the kind of thing. Metal supports which you screw onto a wall and then clip on shelf supports. The upright metal supports have lots of slots so you can place the shelf supports at different heights.   
The Coop Bau and Hobby (as MarieZug mentioned) is by far better for shelving systems and shelving supports.   
I went to the Coop Bau and Hobby in Pfäffikon and it is brilliant for all kinds of building and Hobby/Arty stuff! Lots of Hobby and Arty stuff for your children and you to buy!   
On the building side of things; it had the largest section of screws/nuts and bolts that I have ever seen. More importantly it had the metal shelving supports and system that I needed.

			Hi, 
I've been searching for stackable plastic drawers in Zurich but have only seen plastic boxes or small units of drawers. 
Tried all the usual shops such as Coop, Migros, Ikea etc 
Does anyone know where to get them in Zurich? They need to be large and I used get them from MUJI in London.     http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?V=1&amp;Sec=3&amp;Sub=16&amp;PID=156

Placed an order from them via the website. I got everything in duplicate, to two different names (spellings were different). They blamed me and said that the operator must have had trouble with my bad german (too bad I ordered online and do know how to spell my own name - which in both versions they never got right), said they never received returns sent, and to make a long story short, I had to pay for a lot of stuff that was returned to them. In the end, I just started to call them Happy Thieves.

			The purpose is to support specific Russian orphanages (care homes) by   
1. Providing workshops, crafts and games for the children during the vacations (i.e. when they don't have school)   
2. Funding the costs of the workers during these times.     
3. Allowing sponsorship of individual children within the orphanages 
I've started doing such trips, and people I work with, and socialise are interested in making donations.  Rather than just taking their money, perhaps putting it into a seperate account, it seems better to me to have a formal structure, for transparency ( and to make it harder for me to syphon the money into NotAllThere holdings   )   
Donations to a Swiss based charity are also tax deductable, so that makes the donations more efficient, and attractive to corporate donations.  It also allows applications to be made to other funds.

			Okay good news.  
Today I happened to talk to someone over the phone from Interio who asked me about the number on the card. He said that if left it inactive the card is invalid after 2 years (from the last day of inactivity).  
Not very happily but yes, on requesting over the phone, he agreed to reset the validity till today.   
So I went to the Interio store on Bahnhofstrs. Zurich and bought something for 10CHF, so that my card is valid again for another two years. 
Hope someone else is not unfortunate (or lazy enough ) like me to fall in such a situation at the first place. If they do, well, there is silver lining to the cloud!

			Whoa...   
Plenty of food for thought, for sure. 
I guess my initial constraints are: 
1) study language: english, definitely not german (I manage the language but will need all my resources as it is to combine work + study, so I might make *that* part easier for me). So it looks like the UK institutions are the quickest and most effective route for now.   
2) Would need the degrees to be compliant to EU + swiss standards, to begin with - but here I note that apparently only the Open University seems to be compliant with Switzerland. Should I want to attend courses at SUPSI in Lugano, would the credits be transferable from the University of London?   
3) Definitely a point worth noting is that I will need a postgrad course which is palatable to asian culture & values. I'll leave this factor on the side for the moment.   
Thank you all - your perspectives in this matter are really appreciated!   
Ciao

Whilst there will be energy savings from the newer types, the environmental and health matters do not appear to have been properly addressed, as mentioned in the article. Another point is that many of the newer bulbs are not suitable for use with dimmer switches or outdoor lighting.   
The ban will only apply to the EEC.  I guess that it will eventually affect Switzerland as well.    
This shouldn't affect the availability of bulbs with bayonet or screw fittings. They are available in both types and I don't see any reason for this to change.

			No, that's not what I meant at all. There are a number of possibilities here: 
- You intend to travel to a certain country - checking out what they stock beforehand allows you to, for instance, make calls to make sure they have something in stock when you turn up or to generally see what you want to buy   
- You intend to travel to a certain country and have relatives there, meaning you can send things to their house and take them back to with you   
- You can't travel but have friends or relatives in a certain country, who would be prepared to send things to you. If you don't want things to get held up in customs, it might be useful to just mark them as gifts. Since your relatives are not selling them to you and all the tags can be removed, usually you are fine. I guess it's not by the book but every time I've done it the ""right way"", I ended up paying extortionate fees AND waiting weeks to get my stuff. Not impressed. Obviously, if whatever you are sending is worth less than CHF 150 (including the shipping!),they are usually not so pissy about it.   
I was merely describing what I do, I'm surprised you took it so literally...

			Re the master at ETHZ/UZH. I once found a couple of posts about the programme on the  ; you might want to have a look at them. University tuition fees in Switzerland are low compared to many other countries (especially US and UK), e.g. tuition fees at ETHZ for a year amount to about CHF 1250 for Swiss citizens, if I remember correctly. Regarding internships and jobs, I would advise inquiring with the secretary or the professors and ask where the alumni of the programme are now working. Some people say that it's best to do your finance master in the place where you're planning to work, in order to be able to use the network of the professors and alumni, and because the companies will be used to hiring graduates from the master and will know what to expect in terms of quality.

But if the pins were to be replaced by a new one, then you've nothing to lose by trying to fix it yourself.    
I wonder what would happen if the repair shop broke the pin? Would they carry the cost? I guess if you fix the price beforehand you're OK as otherwise, it could well end up cheaper to buy a new camera!

			Hey y'all   
It's that time of year when economically sensitive (err... ok, fine, cheap) people can typically get pretty good deals.   
Anyone who feels like sharing is invited to post stores with particularly good post-Christmas deals here for my (and presumably other people's) benefit.   
Although I have to admit, I'm not expecting too much; seems like we saw some really good before-Christmas sales already, prices aren't likely to go much beyond 50% off...

			As I have noticed over the past few years, the ""big sales"" are starting  
earlier and earlier.  Here in the East part of Switzerland, the Winter-Sale  
in some stores has already begun.     
Sure, more people are spending less money this year.  However, the  
sales will still be there, all over!  Normally, shortly after Christmas.     
FYI, I am friends with a number of shop owners locally.  They are working  
either on the 26th to redecorate and reprice, or they are starting very  
early (5:am) on the 27th... When the big sales start.   
My sister-in-law in ZH has invited her entire family to a shopping  
blow-out.  They are on the road all day throughout Zürich.   
So, to sum it up, there are plenty of sales.  If they have not yet started,  
then they will start very soon.

6881	07.03.2007, 23:16	Forum Veteran	Thanked 2,398 Times in 730 Posts	Location: Dietikon ZH	"    Actually there's two issues here. The first issue is with the artwork of the Euro notes. Yes this was a big compromise and I agree with you that it's very boring. I remember there was also endless arguments about whether the islands belonging to a certain nation beginning with ""S"" would be included in the map or not. If you take a look the current euro notes you'll see a lot of care has been taken to include islands, even when they fall way outside of the map area! The second (and separate issue) is the printing process itself (hence your comment about counterfeiters). Again this was a compromise but for a different reason - the existing central banks of the euro zone would be left with useless printing presses, as well as a loss of jobs, so they divided up the work and each nation printed a note. The result was that security was as effective as the lowest common denominator...      I tend to agree with you here, except for the fact that the Australian government (or rather the CSIRO) owns the patent on that technology. Other nations have been happy to licence it for their own banknotes, but I seriously doubt that Switzerland would be happy to do so. Hardly good for national pride is it?   
One important point to note - it does LOOK as though the colours in use on these notes are too bright for paper. But we are viewing these on our monitors which are capable of displaying colours not possible on paper. It might be that the artist wanted them to look like this, but these colours haven't been adjusted to the ones which will be possible on paper. (sorry, I just double checked and the colours do look darker than I first thought - they may be possible on paper. If your monitor is not colour-calibrated it may be displaying the colours brighter than they actually are)   
That said - there is one thing that supports the idea that these designs may be realised on polymer - notice that each note has a circular design that looks like a moon? This type of design, allowing a transparent section, is commonly found on polymer notes.

			Hi 
Not sure it'll help you but you mentiioned the cost of T shirt is $100. You  generally pay customs if an item you paid is more than Sfr60 which is why you got charged. So for example you paid less than this amount for the T-shirt and you can prove it, you can ask for a refund back.   
For example, I bought some jeans on ebay once and the person put a worth of £35 and I ended getting charged import though I paid a lot less for them. So I sent the proof to Swiss customs and they refunded me the $.

			You have requirements concerning safety announcements depending on what rules the airline flies by (FAA or JAR-OPS for example), but that is all in terms of announcements (that I am aware of).   
Most airlines do the annoucements in the language of the carrier, English and the foreign destination (when pre-recorded audio is available and working).   
Once I did a flight to Pristina, whereas in the whole boat ( ) we only found one person that spoke a language that any of us did (out of a choice of DE/E/FR/I/SP), with his help the flight went fairly well.

			Just a quick update for future grooms and groomsmen...   
It is NOT possible to rent a half decent suit here!!!    
We searched EVERYWHERE (Zurich, Winterthur, Chur, bridal stores, Schaffhausen.. etc).   
There are one or two places that have about 3 suits for hire and they are all tuxedos with 3/4 length jackets and cost about CHF 350 to hire.   
So, for all those who are planning to get married - save yourself the (lengthy) rounds and buy the suits from the outset!

			Hi,   
I am looking to dress up in 80's gear for a party, so i would like a white or blue suit for a Miami vice theme.   
I have been to a few fasnacht stores in the area but not seen anything suitable.   
Anyone any ideas ?   
Also, if anyone knows where i could get some plastic bling jewellery that would be great   "	made some interesting contributions	Join Date: Mar 2008	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Fancy Dress - Luzern	grimmus	Posts: 162

my english has adapted to so many different places it doesn't really have a distinct accent.  even still...my husband likes to remind me that i am the inferior english speaker (he's british).

But when the blind is raised, the cords become longer and these little O rings just dangle along with the rest of the excess cord, and that is a hazard. There is no mechanism to lock the cords, unlike most other blinds sold at Ikea.    
I see in your profile you are from Sweden, maybe you work for Ikea?  
My post was not an attack on Ikea, it was just to let others who have this blind know that they can return it. The risk of a child being strangled by this blind, which happened in the US, is just a great in the rest of the world. In my opinion, the recall should be worldwide. The basis of their recall is their concern for safety. If the O ring was a solution, why didn't they offer this in the US?  "	null	null	null	Ikea Recalls Iris and Alvine Roman Blinds	guest	null

			Hi Rachel 
I'm not sure if you can get ticket vouchers which are valid for   theaters in Zurich, but I know that the Schauspielhaus (which has the main location at the Pfauen, the other in the Schiffbau) offers vouchers:       
They do have a pretty good and varied programme, so that might be an idea.

Just thought I'd let you all know I saw CHRISTMAS CRACKERS for sale TODAY at the  .

			It really depends on what YOU & HE want together. You should know, if you want friendly people, ability to read everything you get in the post or shop and 7 day-a-week shopping, Canada is the spot to be.  
If you want to make good money and know (more or less) you are not going to get mugged walking around the city at night (or day in some places around TO), Switzerland has that. 
Tough call; salary, taxes, health care, people, diversity, travel. These are my questions which have very different replies depending on which country and city. 
If you have both passports and can afford the move, try them both. 
Places in Canada - Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto, maybe Halifax would be similar to Zurich.

			Update....   
We drove to Heiden today to see what we could find, the were starting to set up for the market tomorrow, so no luck. We reckon it will be great if anyone decides to go and the drive is very pretty. We assume it will be more of a ""sidewalk sale"" versus an actual hut type market.   
We ended up going to Konstanz and hit a few shops and the Christmas market there, it was quite crowded but very festive. If you plan visiting on a Saturday in December, make sure to get there early because parking was hard to find!!

I am trying to find out if anybody knows of any centers for children or less fortunate people around Lausanne/Geneva to do some charity work over the Christmas holidays?

			Hi alanmack,   
We're not in Geneva, however we have searched high and low in the German speaking part (including Zurich) for suit rental for our wedding and found absolutely nothing! It is really not done here (well over our side anyway!). We did find one or two at bridal stores and they wanted CHF400 just to rent!   
However for a work function we picked up a black suit for approx CHF270 from Charles Vogele and a black bow tie from C & A for CHF12. C & A also had cheap suits however didn't have Mr Kadie's size.   
Good luck and please let us know if you find any suits for rent!

			This is normal, however what often happens is the reverse situation, which is equally annoying.   
1. You order something, and ask how long it will take. 
2. Vendor sucks teeth, shakes head and says, ""This is going to be a problem, it's going to take at least 9 weeks."" 
3. A week and a half later, the vendor rings up and proudly announces, ""Your goods are here and ready to pick up!""   
Has happened to me with ordering new bank cards, and particularly annoyingly, with the nursery furniture for our new baby. The goods had to wait in the shop (something the vendor was not happy about), as the baby's room was not ready, and we simply had not had time to save up for them.   
Cheers

That is to say, legally speaking it should be declared, and you will have to pay the Swiss import duty (which is 7.6% I think), but enforcement tends to be a bit... ""lax"".   
A word of advice, however.  If the UK is anything like Australia, then the prices charged inside the airport will be so inflated that - even  the VAT removed - they will still be more expensive than in regular (or mail order) stores.  Certain exceptions to this principle might apply to particular brands that are pretty much never discounted (eg: anything Apple).  My few looks in the LHR T5 shops while transitting would suggest this is true.   
Also, computer equipment does not appear to be ""expensive"" in Switzerland, compared to the UK (at least based on component prices, I'm afraid I don't often buy whole machines).   
Basically, I'm not sure that you'd really save much, if anything, over buying it locally, and you'd likely be faced with problems making any warranty claims, or similar if anything went wrong.  Do your sums carefully...

			if you want budget ink, try    
I had troubles with the ones I bought since they are NOT GOOD QUALITY. 
I feared the ink would fade over time, clog print heads, etc, which they did, but the person wanted CHEAP so that is what they got. 
The owner was great though, came to me and collected the used and sealed ones and offered a refund. Ended up buying proper name brands in the end. My advice, don't waste your tiem or money on cheap brands or refills. His English was good as well.  
good luck

			Hi there psychodelicate, 
good for you that you are having such a great time in Basel that you have (almost) forgotten your computer, great to read you are having such a positive experience and took the time to share your enthusiasm with us     take a look on here  . there are many English Forum (not only) events,some in Basel itself and if you are feeling adventurous,why not sign up for any one of the organised events, elsewhere in the country.  
These may help you shed the feeling of ""lonely"", should it become   okay.   
Keep enjoying yourself,   
Ros

			No worries. 
I was being stressed by my son while writing before, and reading it again I've realised I forgot a few things: 
Photocopies cost 20Rp/copy, so remember to take change with you. You have to feed the machine with 20Rp or 1 Franc pieces - might other change as well - I'm afraid I haven't used one for a while... 
Printer paper might only be available in the larger Coop and Migros - depending in which area of Basel you live in your local Coop might be too small. Places like Migros in Claraplatz, Coop Bachletten should stock it. Manor will have paper too - it's quite possibly upstairs in the computer department though (sorry - I lived in Basel for 10 years, but moved to the country 4 years ago and don't get back much any more!) 
Happy hunting :-)

			So, after reading all the responses, it looks like Wii is the way to go. My son gets excercise, it's more sociable, and everyone seems to have fun. I also noticed that there are less PS3 fans, and once you factor in that the PS2 games won't work on the new PS3 consoles, I may as well keep the PS2 and get the Wii.

			Hi rowlandh   
We recently moved to Switzerland from the UK and drove over with our cats. We had to get them pet passports which showed that they'd had a rabies injection and were microchipped and that the vaccination had worked, which required a blood test and a month's wait (this may have been due to UK re-entry requirements though - as I recall they just had to have proof of having had the jab to enter Switzerland).   
When we arrived at the Swiss border I had all my paperwork ready, but the guard just checked our passports, not the cats, and waved us through!    
The cats hated the journey though because we haven't ever really taken them anywhere in the car except to the vets. I guess if you're going to do it regularly though they'll get used to it. Lots of treats also helps    
A quick google gave me this website   
which tells you about travelling to France from Switzerland - you can probably find a better link with Germany specific info.   
I hope this of some use rather than me just rambling on about cats! I love them - please post pictures when you get them    
maud

			Oh god, orchards are way beyond me: I'm somehow killing off one of those so-called 'hardy' indoor long-leafed things. The leaves are turning brown and mould is forming on the top of the soil (but not on my other two plants).   
But back to orchards, I recall my mum managed to keep one alive by keeping it out of direct sunlight outside (in Australia), in an area where it got some rain, but not a lot. I think it was some sort of freak orchard determined to live through anything we could throw at it.

			I use the Omega lawyer insurance, is about CHF 100 per year, but I think you can only use them when you are in trouble with the justice and  a lawyer, not only to do some small legal consultation.   
Paulita, if you need just assistance or advice for the taxes declarations or so, the Human Ressources department at your company ( in case you work ) normally help you with this.

The bulbs get very hot, so I would not recommend installing them unless they are well out of reach. They are particularly useful when you have no central light source on the ceiling of the room, and all you have to work with is an electrical outlet. In this case you can buy a ""Beamer"" so you can control the lights with a small remote, even dim them.  I have installed this system in the top floor of houses, usually where there are wood beams.  
Lumimart sells these lighting systems, along with the Beamer.

			Unlike back home, I do know things grow here.  But I can't help but put the same in my flower boxes that I did back home.     
I cover the bottom with a green moss and add evergreen branches and holly branches with berries.  I also accent them with pine cones and white, red, and natural colored twigs that you can find in the florist shop, real or fake.  It's a no fuss, no care arrangement, that lasts all winter, with just the right amount of color.  It's also quite festive for the holidays, but not overly festive for the non holidays.   
I can't find a photo.  But sort of picture just taking a christmas wreath apart and arranging it in your flower box.  Without the tacky factor.  Actually, that is what I did one year and it turned out fab.

			Hi Tiabelle. are you in an apartment house? If you are report them to the agency or caretaker. I should imagine other apartments have them too, have you asked anyone else? If a few of you complain the agency will treat the whole house. Otherwise you can buy stuff in Migros Coop or a drogerie.

			I recall someone mentioning in a thread here that it is rather difficult to find call center staff that speaks English. So my tip would be to check with Swisscom or Sunrise e.g.   
Another tip would be to take on a voluntary function in a Verein. That would give you valuable exposure to German.

			Diggelmann EDV-Zubehoer in Fehraltorf ( ) sell power boards for 5 or 6 international plugs (""Universal-Steckdosenleisten""). When you move again, you only need to change the main cord, which uses a type 113 (C13, G6) plug, and then can continue using Swiss, Australian, UK, .... whatever, plugs at your new place of residence with the same power board. Just got myself some for our Australian plugs - works a treat and we will never change individual plugs again!

			Agarwwals is a good store for Indian food, though there are some Sri Lankan stores which also have a good selection. There is also an Aldi in Bern which can save you a bit on shopping.  
Living in Bern can be as cheap or as expensive as you make it. For transportation you can consider a Libero Abo which costs Sfr 70.- a month and is valid on public transport with the 2 city zones. Or you can get a bicycle, Bern is really easy to ride around. 
Eating out, it really depends what you want. It's possible to eat out for about 75 francs and even less. Expect to pay more for Japanese and Thai food. Movies cost Sfr17.- a person and on Mondays, the tickets cost 12.- 
Accomodation can be quite cheap or ridiculously expensive - again, depends where you want to live. The further away from the centre or old town, cheaper the rents are. It is worth hunting around.  
Hope this helps.

			If you are driving you can go to Kloten then towards Bulach and you will see places where you can park at the side of the road. You can also go from the Glattbrug side. When we lived in Kloten we just cycled there and then just cycled all around the perimeter. You soon get to know it.

			Also depends where you will be!  On the plateau (Zurich, Bern etc) spring should be starting.  Spring bulbs etc flowering.  In the mountains people will still be skiing...in the Tessin (Ticino, Italian part of CH) it will be warmer and usually (not a great word!) in Montreux it will be warmer too. 
You won't need winter clothes, but summer clothes wont work either.  You need layers!

			my friend found her wedding dress dress at this little shop in Enge called Traumbraut, it has new and secondhand wedding dresses - she also has loads of evenning dresses  - I picked up a stunning dress for the wedding for 250CHF and it was new. My friend picked up her 3000CHF wedding dress for half the price - it was once worn, didnt bother her as she saved 1,500CHF    
It was by appointment only, so we went in on a sunday and the shop owner let us take pictures in the dresses, whilst in Zoro/ Marys they were so unhelpful! She spoke English and was very nice!   
Most of the dresses are on the site, I think it was   or its .com 076 529 0899 was the number.

			A tip, not sure if you need it, but if you have double glazing, you can still get one of those cat doors installed. I imagine it is expensive but they work fine. If you rent though, you would have to ask permission, and probably replace the window the hole was drilled into when you leave. But this might be worth it....

			I knew a girl from Berkeley California who moved to Zurich with her boyfriend. After a couples years they broke up, but she decided to stay here (his mother had a big house just outside of Zurich and lived there alone, so offered to rent her a bedroom cheap).   
She spent 7 years here giving private English lessons, meeting people in Cafe's for 1 hour conversational English for 50 CHF an hour (that was some time ago). She managed to survive for a long time doing that, taking language courses, travelling etc. She pulled this off without every having a permit. Eventually the law caught up with here when she tried to apply for a permit, and she was chucked out of the country, and had to return back to California. She now runs her own company specializing in American-accent training for foreigners who have moved to the US.

So much that it only makes sense for a couple or a family to do the VAT thing.   
I agree with you.  I'll often pick up a couple bottles of wine.  And the selection is pretty cool.  I like the low-fat Brie and Bleu cheeses.  They also have these big containers of really nice dried herbs.   
The grape juice at Geant is good and cheap though.  Way cheaper than here in CH.  But you're only allowed to bring 3 litres per person across the border.

			Hi again,   
Just out of my own experience... if something ends up with higher charges I have to inform my client and see if we can find a solution together.    
However   I have quoted, I have to stick to it.. unless it is something that I have no control over (storage, delays or customs etc.). 
In your case they even came to visit and have a look at it - it is definitely not your fault that they calculated VERY sharpish! Ask to speak to the supervisor and point that out.  
I have heard of this 10% clause as well, though I cannot say for sure if this is a law or just a rule of thumb - I would go with that after you explained the situation. Maybe Richard knows more?? 
If they're not inclined to agree, I would only pay the quoted amount and wait for them to come back to you. Before they can take legal action you will end again at the Friedensrichter (not sure if arbitrary is the right word).   
Alternatively you could try to contact Konsumentenschutz (consumers protection agency?), that should fall under their responsibility.   
Good luck and all...

			That's a tough one. But, I do know of some BIO egg farms, when the hens stop laying they are sent off, 3000 or more at a time, to pet food factories.    
I would suggest looking for a small BIO egg farm in your area and offering to buy the non-laying hens. Only problem is you would probably have to dispatch them your self - and if you haven't done this before, I can tell you from experience, it is NOT easy!

Nellen & Quack (based in Germany) was the company i used to get my things from UK to here.   
But there are several others e.g Wilgo Freight, Expeditors etc... (sorry dont know any swiss ones, but should not matter as all theses companies have their own agents in countries all over the world)   
They will ship anything as long as its on a pallet by air or sea to and from anywhere on the planet (within reason)   
These 'freight forwarders' or 'transport agents' (not 100% sure how to describe these companies) normally only transport goods for companies, but are always more than willing to take the odd extra pallet here or there to fill up a lorry that is already heading in that direction.   
If you do use a company like this make sure that you state that you want your items to be on a 'non-stackable pallet' otherwise you goods will arrive looking like a pancake............also using shrink wrap is highly recommended to ensure they dont fall off.   
Hope that helps.

			We had our reception up on Ulto Kulm.  It's quite smart now and there are cool rooms.   
We rented an extra train to take the guests down after the normal trains had stopped running for the night. This took all the guests who weren't staying straight back down into the middle of Zurich which was great as none of them had cars.

			Muze7,   
There are essentially 2 things here. The first is your relocation allowance, which was a once-off thing that was taxed. This is annoying and you may have no recourse (apart from asking the EU to pay the extra), but the thing that concerns me the most is the fact that *you* are paying the employer deductions as well as your own. This is most definitely not correct. I've checked with a friend who runs her own business and who researched this. She says that there is no way for the employer to get out of this, and even if they have the employee accept it via the work contract the employee could take them to court and they would lose. I strongly suggest you contact this guy:

He's a tax lawyer and deals with a lot of international and expat clients. His English is absolutely fine. He's not the cheapest in town, but hopefully you won't need long. I had a session with him last week.

			I too have no grave to visit but I put pictures up and light a candle. However, for some reason I've never liked those red candles... I just don't think they're pretty but then I'm not catholic... I have my own strange rituals but from what I remember burning is the symbolic crossing from this world to the next. I prefer the thought that my love and thoughts are burning still for that person...

in case anyone else stumbles on this thread in a search I have also found a really nice fabric/linens shop in Pratteln, just around the corner from the Ikea and opposite Luminart and the erotic shop .  It's called Stoff and Vorhang Fachmarkt and they have a huge range of fabrics for dresses, curtains, upholstery, carnival as well as bed linen, knitting wools and craft items (oh, and all the hardware for surtains as well(.   
thanks again,

A phone with caller id is not enough if you miss a call. For this you would need a phone that stores the calls too. An answering machine may also be a solution though often people hang up.   
There are many phones now available with these features. Not all are available with English display, or English instructions.    
Someone was selling phone systems here in case you are looking to upgrade.       
I know the Siemens systems have an English display and instructions and store missed calls.

			The company I pre-ordered the Wii Fit from allowed backing out. They just didn't know what the final price was going to be at the time they listed it for pre-order - the prices aret dictated by Nintendo and there's not much room for undercutting - I think ExLibris gets away with 0.20 CHF cheaper, but that's it.   
BTW I can thoroughly recommend the company I ordered from - I've used them a few times now:   - speedy delivery, efficient and good service.

			I think its a simple matter of calling the 'Altersheim' s in your area. Look em up in the phone book call em and ask them if they need help. They usually do.    
I had to work in one once as penance (community service) for a major traffic violation. 
And there were volunteers there who came in just to keep the tenants company. To accompany them on walks or outings, hang out chit chat , basically hang around be friendly and helpful ( Even to be entertaining, There was a clown guy who used to come in occasionally and act silly at meal times.)   
They said theres no shortage of things to do, and the value added to the lives of the retirees having a young friend around is quite precious. 
so volunteers were always welcome. (this was in Baden so way out of the way for you)    
But I suspect your phone calls would be met with sincere welcome where ever the Altersheims are.   
Give it a shot.

			I also hired a van in Cambridge to move over to Geneva this summer. These guys were fantastic:       
Cheapest place I could find, no problems with driving to Switzerland, no problems at all with the usual damage checks (the van was very new, but he wrote down at the start that it was basically scratched all over so that we know unless we totalled it that it wasn't going to be a problem!!).   
We got a Luton van with a tail lift, which made loading and unloading sofas etc a lot easier.

1. What is 'Polyfill' referred to as? Is there is french name or do I just look for polyfill?   
2. Also, 'Dowels' would be called what? and found in which section at MParc exacty?

			Very much so. I have no intention on entertaining patronising , smart arse shop assistants who feel that because they are serving the public, they have the right to preach their brand of green politics while taking their money.   
The right and wrongs of reuseable carrier bags are irrelevant in this case. Some people of blinded by the need to (and to be seen to be) right-on and environmental evangelists.   
Be under no illusion. The shop was endeavouring to increase its profits from sales of overpriced shopping bags by adopting this stance.

			I saw one metre high plants at Ikea on special last week 20chf down to 5chf. I also went through the plant section and picked myself out a nice little peace lily.   
My main criticism of the Ikea plants is that most of them are pot-bound - they have out-grown the pots, and after that the roots go round and round in the pot and then stick out the bottom - so re-potting would be recommended.   
If I was at home I'd buy about 10 x $2 Ikea pot plants, take 'em to my dad's place, re-pot them using his potting mix and pots and leave them in his greenhouse until he says one day 'Oh, did you forget about your plants ?' - then I know they are ready to come to my place...   
Usually over-watering rather than under-watering is the problem for indoor plants. I put my little Ikea purchase into a container of water and soaked it when I got home, but I won't water it again until it looks droopy...  that's the good thing about peace-lillies - easy to know when they need a water.   
I saw some great big cocos palms at coop today - across the bridge from Central - left hand side facing Hauptbahnhof - they were in the window along the little side-street as we were walking past - looked great but huge plants in tiny pots... was thinking 'why do they do that' - then I realised, probably less weight for importation or transport - little pots take up a lot less room - and of course they keep them looking great in the greenhouse and then sell them at their peak...

			Genuine Art Deco kit is hard to come by. There's a huge industry selling on auction sites such as eBay etc. I'd hazard a guess online would be the best place to seek items.   
There's a decent - although pricey - store next door to Paddy Reilly's. The woman there is friendly enough though I wonder how much she shifts; some things have been in that store for years.   
Surprisingly the Flea markets are worth a look but be an early riser; most of the fresh stuff is gone by 9am, or they're asking ridiculous prices. Bürkliplatz in Zurich is often 300% more expensive than Helvetiaplatz, so cut your cloth etc.   
Reproduction stuff should be easier to find; again, try eBay

			You could always compromise - check out the Schindellegi / Feusisberg area, and even the upper bits of Wollerau.   
We're at 780 meters, and are often above the fog line while the lakeside folks sit in the Nebelsuppe. And we still have a beautiful view of the lake (assuming there is no fog on the lake, and thus something to see), as well as into the mountains.   
There are days, however, when we are smack dab in the middle of a cloud. I rather enjoy it then -  cozy, in an eerie sort of way. If I feel the need for sun, a walk up the Etzel or Rossberg (ca 1100 meters) usually does it.   
Both Schindellegi and Feusisberg are small villages - you have to like that kind of life. I do, very much.   
(It also helps if you find the sound of cowbells soothing...   )   
But if sun is really important, perhaps the Pfannenstiel area would be better for you.

As Monolta and Oly only really produce(d) consumer cameras there is little collectibility value unfortunately. You might be able to get maximum 100-150Fr for each. Better to give them to a 10 years old with a handfull of kodak 400 film, manual photography is a great way to learn!

			The usual term for them is 'Wochenmarkt'   
Sat.  7-12 in the 'Graben' in Aarau (the bigger market, more stands) 
Wed. 8-11:30 in Aarau (smaller one)   
 both are advertized as vegetable and flower markets - though these 
 markets typically also have cheese, meat, sometimes fish, as well as 
 occasional crafts or other specialized stands   
Saturday morning is also the day for the big market in Baden   
Friday 7-11 at the Rathausplatz is the Wettingen market.   
These are the three largest communities in your vicinity; for smaller  
markets, the local paper will probably list them somewhere.  Or  
go ask at the Gemeinde you live in.

			Hi all,   
Recently I noticed that I have been missed monthly coupon from Migros since I moved to new house. 
I think I could change the my address on the web site. 
I tried to log-in on their web site with my M-CUMULUS number, but I have no idea about the initial password. 
Is there any convention here in Switzerland? like 0000, 1234, ... (this didn't work for me) 
It seems like I didn't register my e-mail address when I joined the membership, so I couldn't get fogotten password through the internet.  
Otherwise I need to go to information desk in Migros, right?

			Another point I just thought of.    
If you are experienced and confident it is possible to go for direct assessment for level 2. The assessment should take about a half day.    
You will need to be confident in boat handling in close quarters, coming alongside, picking up a mooring. Launching and recovering a boat off a trailer, man overboard drills and high and low speed handling.    
You will also need to be aware of the theory behind boat handling, have an idea of basic maintenance of an outboard motor, the rules of the road and safety equipment that should be carried onboard.    
If you want your coastal endorsement you will have to do the practical in tidal waters and have a sound knowledge of tides and a little bit of coastal navigation skills.    
The advantage to going this route if you are up for it, is that you could then go back to the UK and do the advanced certificate. This course is really a hoot. It takes all the theory and handling skills a step further, and includes rough weather handling, and night time navigation. Not much use in Switzerland but damn its fun!

			We tried to enrol our daughter in the music school in Zug, unfortunately applications need to be in by the end of May to start in September. We eventually found a lovely chap who started his own school with two other teachers. His prices are very reasonable and he is the epitome of patience. I don't know if he teaches violin certainly he does piano, sax, trumpet, flute, clarinet and oboe as well as double bass. If you want his number, PM me. 
You could also ask in the music shop near Kolin cod piece platz, yet another helpful man.

			Hello there,   
Well...... I could add some insights why I believe that Teleshopping is one of the most stupid things to do with your money, but I shall abstain from that.... (unless you want to give your hard earned cash to Mike Shiva??)   
As for consumer protection, there are a couple of companies or foundations that   provide help (never used them myself), they should all be in German only though:     - Magazine and TV show   
or of course      
I don't have closer information, nor could I provide you with more insight (sure somebody else here can), but I wish you good luck with your quest...   
PS: If you want to get the best price possible for something you have seen/taken a fancy to, try   and you shall find the best deal, mostly... - the crap they try to sell on Teleshopping is usually not worth the postage (in my opinion!).

			Lots of good advice in the previous posts.   
I think that it's easier to adapt to life in a new country if one makes it a point of going out and not spending one's days at home. Since you have small children, I wouldn't be surprised if you actually   spending most of your time at home and, in my opinion, that could explain why you're finding it more difficult than your husband to adjust to life in Switzerland (I'm making the added assumption that your husband has got a job to go to every day).   
Anyway, I thought I'd post a link to the following leaflet from website of the UK Council for International Student Affairs on culture shock and adjusting to life in a new country. Most of the sections are not relevant to you, but the section ""A model of culture shock"" might help you by giving you an understanding of the phases you're going through.    
All the best.

			Wow, i'm really shocked that the Swiss would dump hazardous waste in such a populated area   ...it seems so ""un-Swiss"" (note to self: roll up the windows next time driving by Kölliken) About 70% of the population lives in the Northern part of Switzerland, I don't understand why they didn't they dump it in the less populated southern area?       Mike Shiva was spawned from that. If you dump it at his house, it will only make him stronger....

I am so sorry for the loss of your friend.  I know you must have loved her very much and while her background must have caused tremendous stress and emotional pain to her, know and be assured that she was here for a purpose and served her role in the universe.   
One of the things that helped me when I lost someone very close to me was to sit at the computer and write and write and write.  I also cried a lot.  You have got to find ways to release and channel the grief.   
Another thing that helped me in releasing it, was to try and intellectualize the grieving process.  It helped me to handle the overwhelming grief I was feeling and get through the day.   
Grief has 5 stages and there is a book written about it.  Here is a wiki link that explains a bit about it        
I'm so sorry, 
Fraueli

SG is fairly cheap, so you definitely can live on it. If you want to go skiing in winter you should consider buying a car - otherwise, there shouldn't be any unexpected huge expenses. If you don't like the shared flat, you can even find an apartment in the SG area for around 1000.   
Otherwise, you need to decide whether you like the city. I lived there for some time - its generally nice, beautiful nature, etc. - but I didn't enjoy the small town feel.

			I think it's a hairy situation and at the very least you just learned what backups are for    
What I would do would be taking a linux live cd and try making a bytecopy of the disk using dd, and then play around with that to try and recover the data using the usual software.   
You can get yourself a linux livecd and not install anything. You should probably seek help if you're not an expert. You can actually do the same under windows: get yourself the dd utility here:       
and get an image of the disk. You obviously need free space on your hard drive at least as big as the drive you want to image, since you'll make an exact byte-per-byte copy of the dying drive.   
Good luck.

Picture this, since i am swedish im obviously gonna teach my kids swedish, the same goes for portguese with my boyfriend, then since we communicate mostly in english, the kids have to learn english aswell. And of course since we are living in Switzerland ( i hope) the kids at least have to learn french, and if they go to a swiss school maybe even german !!!!   
thats at least 4 languages possibly five , poor kids    
the only other language the kids have to learn is chinese, that would make them all set...lol..

The term lived on after the addition of pedals and riders became known as ""pedal pushers""

			My experience of price match offers (in the UK) is that they can turn out to be an empty promise.   
I once helped (OK, got conned into helping) a colleague shop for a fridge for her new house. We quickly discovered that most of the big electrical chains (Dixons, Comet, Rumbelows, Coop etc) all had price match offers, so set to with this in mind.   
What we found in practice was that each chain had its own model of the same basic fridge, with its own variations on shelving and freezer compartment, sufficiently different to justify different model numbers. All were the same price to within 5 or 10 quid. If I remember correctly, the Coop had a slight edge both on price and the fact that you could get the stamps (read - [i]lots[/] of stamps).   
In the end the best deal we found was from a small family-run electrical shop, where we could deal directly with the owner.   
OK, that story was from the UK, but from your example the same practice may apply here as well.   
I have been told that if you find the right small business here in Switzerland, they can match the prices of the big chains. You need to ask of course, and definitely ask the owner rather than an assistant.

			Hi,   
a buddy of mine is going to get married and so we are preparing a stag night (Junggesellen-Abschied) for him. After lots of humiliation and drinking we'd like to reward him with a visit to a strip club and here is where our problem starts: Does anybody know a good strip club in Basel?  
We asked several cab drivers (usually a reliable source) and it seems that all the strip bars they know are also well known...err lets say establishments for horizontal entertainment. Does anybody know a good old fashioned ""normal"" strip club?!   
(If you feel more comfortable about it, you can send me an answer as a PN  )   
Thanks

			Here's a little more that *might* help.  Buchholterberg is a small community southeast of Oberdiesbach; you have to go around the small hill/mountain called Falkenflue, and through another small community called Bleiken to get there.  It's on the road to Heimenschwand (the other way around the Falkenflue to Heimenschwand is via Linden and Jassbach, but that won't take you through Buchholterberg).     
The community itself, according to its website, belonged to a von Stein family from 1387 to 1525, at which point it was sold to the authorities.  After 1525 it was part of the area controlled by the bailiff (Landvogt) of Signau, and was under the judicial authority of the court at Röthenbach.  The community itself belonged to the district of Konolfingen.  After 1768, the community of Bleiken (see above) was separated from it, meaning the two communities formed a unit before this date.  All this to give you some idea of the complexity of relations around 1631.   
A list of early family names of citizens of the community does not include a Brenneman.  That may or may not mean anything; Switzerland has a system in which the community of which you are a citizen (Bürger) denotes where your ancestors come from - and which has to, by the way, take care of you in old age if you need such care even today.  That is a different category than being a resident (Einwohner), so you may well have residents in communities who are not citizens and hence are not listed in such rolls.     
Best, 
John

 Ref Yanks - that is a term we English use for all Americans. Yes it is inaccurate - the Yanks were the North - ans so yes it is insulting to some Americans. That said, it is SUPPOSED to be insulting. Likewise Poms, Limeys, Krauts, Frogs etc are all insulting terms. 
 Ref Swiss I don't know of any terms for them. Gummihalz is their insulting nick name for the Germans, mind!

			We use two different options for our male Vizsla   
1. Mitzy's Pet Sitting - she is really amazing and I don't worry AT ALL when I leave our dog with her.  She is very trustworthy and reasonably priced.     
2. Our vet recommend the place he works with: Helena Frey-Stiftung (fur Teirschutz).  They let the doggies run around (also do cats), but get full very quick.  We've put our dog in other kennels here, but he always comes back depressed and with weight loss.  He seems to enjoy it there and I can call and get updates from the girls who work there when I'm away.  These guys are great because they are near the airport so it's easy to drop the dog then fly.

I've been to her twice, once very succesfully, once not as good but I know that I am a difficult client as I have curly hair which I keep short and struggle to find anyone who can manage my hair.     
I have subsequently found someone excellent but he doesn't do English.   
Hope this helps

			I had all my belongings transported from the UK by a company called Pickfords and as I expected somethings were damaged.   
One being my 1970's leather sofa. 
Because the item was insured for more than £100, I have to get a quote for the repair before they will pay out.   
It is the fabric underneath the sofa that is damaged but the sofa was insured for £2000 so I have a bit of money to play with.   
Does anyone know of a company that will repair such an item please?   
On site repair would be best

			Have visited a couple of times when travelling across France and found it very good for teenage boys ie quiksilver, billabong etc  Worth looking at the websites to see which shops are there and also which malls they are in as they are spread across a wide geographical area.  Also check opening times as they close on Sundays etc.

			Hello....I'm hoping you can all help me with the following...   
We are a family of 6 - 2 adults, 4 kids (14,11,8,8)....and are possibly moving to Switzerland (I will be working in Zurich).   
Excluding housing costs / schooling, can anyone here give me a rough - and I know it will be rough - guesstimate of what it would cost us to live in Zurich ? Or can you point me in the direction of any websites / reloczation agents etc.etc.   
Any and all advice VERY gratefully received....and huge thanks in advance.

			Welcome to the community!   
Baden would be an EXCELLENT choice. With the IR express train which runs every half hour you can reach Zurich in less than 20 min. The other direction to Basel takes approx. 40 min, also with frequent trains.   
It's a good sized town with many ex-pats, thanks to the largest two employers, ABB and Alstom. We are seeing new arrivals in town almost on a daily basis.   
Baden's close proximity to both Zurich and Basel allows people here to take advantage of the great offerings in both cities, but the town itself also offers many (surprisingly) cultural and artistic entertainments and is great for family life.   
We are in a somehow similar situation... my husband works in Baden and I am currently exploring job opportunities both in Zurich and Basel... as I know either way it won't be a bad commute at all.

			On a related note, in many cases if you are visiting your country of origin you can buy stuff tax-free there and claim the money back at the airport on the way back to Switzlerland.  Obviously you'll need to provide proof of residence in Switzerland.   
Technically, you're supposed to pay the required taxes on it when you bring it into CH ....  In the case of small, expensive consumer gadgets you could very well 'forget' about them once they're in your pocket, though.   
   However, you should make sure about the laws in the specific country you are visiting.  In the UK your chosen shop has to be signed up for tax-free trading.  They'll give you a form when you buy the goods.

			Hey all,   
I know some people have been talking about this already on other threads but most of it has come to no avail.    
My phone is locked and i have searched the web for how to unlock it but no luck!   
It is a blackberry pearl and is locked to Etisalat (the UAE provider).   
I was told to take it to 'SOS mobile' at Square du Mont-Blanc, but they had closed down. The swiss com store next door then told me to go to a place on Rue de Berne... but again did not see any place after having looked for hours!   
Please any help will really be appreciated!!   
Thanks loads!

7257	01.07.2008, 01:19	Forum Veteran	Thanked 548 Times in 348 Posts	Location: Thurgau	"    It depends on how harsh the winter is and whether you have a sheltered or exposed spot. All things being equal I find you can grow almost anything here, especially as the weather in VD can be mild and warmish (in a gardening sense Ticino, in a gardening sense)  all the way through to the end of October. After that the soil gets too cold to grow much. So up to the start of winter, if you can grow it in the UK you can grow it here. Down here in VD the winters of 2006 and 2007 were very mild and all in all the soil was workable right through to Xmas. But in winters like 2005 when it was hard as a rock for weeks on end and bitterly cold you might as well give up until the soil warms up again in Spring. So you need to keep an eye on the weather forecast or your parsnips might be frozen in the ground for the duration. You could always use a polytunnel to extend the season. Cheap and easy to knock up yourself and makes a big difference. I don't do spuds. Leeks are fine. Brassicas should be no problem but one word on sprouts. They grow well but can turn out a bit bitter if we go from mild to freezing overnight. They need the in between frosty spell to sweeten them off.

But health insurance and deposit fees, renting end of the year bill = huge additional expenses. figure a good 1,000 chf per person per year for basic health insurance.

			i was a big comic fan in the 90's, and read mostly DC comics (sandman, hellblazer, shade, preacher, dark knight), some marvel (X-men, spiderman, daredevil) and some manga (akira, crying freeman), but mostly to pass the time until the next issue of sandman came out. after that series ended in 97, i only check in now and then to see if there's anything interesting. in recent years, i've become quite a fan of Moore's America's Best Comics (ABC) label. really looking forward catching up ...   
i read Lost Girls once, but was rather confused by many of the dreamlike sequences accompanied by asides, so i cant really comment :P. it contained many references to Alice in Wonderland, Wizard of Oz and Peter Pan (I've only read Alice  ) i gotta go read the other 2 novels, and then read Lost Girls again heh...

I have a full police report of the theft and would duly identify myself so that the angel that helps me is sure he is not smuggling radioactive materials or drugs.

			If you haven't done so already, you need to sit down with him and ask him to explain his fees & tell you how many hours & what his expenses have been incurred up to now and what the total he thinks will be.    
Is the process over & you are now just waiting for payment from the offending party or will the lawyer have a lot more work to do?   
He must have some obligation to show you a detailed bill before he takes the money.    
Then ask him, why he said A if he was going to do B. You are both adults. Talk to him.

			This all depends on what sort of gas you used before and what you propsed to use here. Butane works well in the summer but is crap for use outdoors in colder weather. Propane works better in cold weather (we even have BBQs in the snow and just move the unit to the kitchen door  ).  This is because butane turns liquid at a higher temperature than propane but propane also burns hotter so  check that your BBQ is capable of using it.   
If you had a bottle in the UK that had a snap fitting (usually used with the 7 and 15Kg Calor gas bottles) you may have to buy a new regulator with a screw fitting. If you change between propane and butane or vise versa - you will have to get another regulator.   
As said before the people who supply the gas will advise you - but in my experience, it usually means that you will end up spending more money.

			A big fat thanks to all your rad people. 
I am the poor aupair with the stupid broken camera.    
It is only a G7 and it was bought from Australia in March 07 so it is sadly out of warranty.   
I contacted Canon directly and they forwarded me to IT Services as that is the canon repair company in der Schweiz.  And so that is where my camera is at the moment - being held for a 75chf ransom - so taking it to another place might also be in vain.   
If this means anythng to anyone the quote was for parts  
PCB ASS'Y DC/DC & MAIN totalling  294chf and labour 122 chf (taxes not included)  They still haven't answered my query as to whether this was a manufacturer/electircal fault or my negligence - aka often waiting for transport in rain (although I always make sure it is in its waterproof case etc)      My thoughts too kinda - except for the i have no money situation.  That and the whole I can't believe I have a camera I paid 900+ ausssie bucks for that now does diddly squat.  Am intrigued though as to where you found the price for 577.75.  I haven't been able to find anything under 700chf for the G9.  Maybe I could sell some photos taken with the old one to cover the cost of a new camera.  Any suggestions for galleries who support up and coming talent......  
Just kidding

			Hi Ros, 
I seem to have lost my permission to thank you - so I'll have to do it this way: Thank you, that looks lovely!   
Edit: strange, I got a message that I don't have permission to thank you, but the thanks still appears...

			Yes, aphids can be white and soap is a good idea. Best thing is old fashioned soap. Cut off bits with a knife, put it in a sprayer, shake well, then add a bit of oil, like sunflower, olive oil. The combination kills aphids by making them too sticky to move. Wait half an hour, then wash your plants with water, as the soap will damage the leaves if you let it dry and the plant is in the sun the next day. (They will burn). Then wait a few days, if the soil stays clean you can reuse it. To avoid soap dripping into the soil, put the pots onto their side first.

Anyway we did a sammelbestellung with our neighbours for the new dryer from Germany saving a couple of thou in the process  The Germans believe Liebknecht is one of the better companies for refrigeration products.

7323	31.05.2008, 17:20	Member	Thanked 29 Times in 19 Posts	Location: Aeugst am Albis (Zurich)	"    A few weeks back at a kiosk in the hauptbahnhof I went to purchase one of my regular gossip mags ( I know a filthy habit but I am unrepentant!) and I noticed that the price was 9chf. Now I am normally horrified at how much cash I part with to read the same old recycled drivel but this was an all time high. I checked the cover price for  a chf price and it was the usual 4chf 50 so I presumed it was a pricing error on their part.   
As I came to pay, I was amazed to be asked to pay the 9chf and that the till showed this as the scanned price. I queried the cover price with the assistant and she was going to stick to her guns. I pointed out that I never usually paid this much so she deigned to check with a colleage who then actually sided with me. Apparently (this was in Swiss German so I only got the gist of the conversation) as I had actually queried the price and there was a swiss price given on the cover then I was entitled to pay that price.... just as well I chanced my luck I guess  .

In a quick summary Fallanden is      Good things:    1) Next to a lake. Excellent place for doing sports like cycling, roller skating, etc.     2) This is the place where countryside starts but still close to Zurich      3) Big shopping centers in Dietlikon (carrefour), fresh fish market, etc (10 min drive)      4) School has a good reputation     My negatives:     1) Airplane noise: from 6 a.m. until 9 a.m. and from 6 p.m. until 9 p.m. If you work and have to get up at 6 then it is ok.      2) If you work in Zurich, rent a parking in Zurich (might find for 200chf per month) if you do not have one at work. Bus is the only connection. It is not far but takes twice as much to commute.

I arrived on time to find a locked shop, I waited 10 minutes and then I called him (though he had my number on his display he told me when I made the appt last week). He said he was on his way, and when I asked how long, he said 30 minutes. I was not prepared to wait for him, particularly as he didn't even have the courtesy to call me to tell me he was running late. I had client commitments and I wasn't about to re-arrange my schedule on account of him.

			I dont think that it would be a good buy. Even though Koga is a decent brand, the bike is ancient and the parts are really outdated.   
It also depends on what you want to do with the bike. If you want to cruise to the shops and back go out and get something plain and simple. 
If you want to cycle around and get addicted to the sport (here's me holding thumbs!) then I would advise shopping around a bit more and getting something newer than that. 
It will make a HUGE difference to your cycling pleasure.   
As for buying second hand carbon bikes, I really dont think that it is that scary. If you dont know anything about bicycles then just take it into a local bike shop and ask for their opinion.

7343	07.01.2008, 12:27	Forum Veteran	Thanked 339 Times in 199 Posts	Location: Zurich	   Expiration dates are set by pharmaceutical companies, based on their internal tests of the longest period of time that a medication is known to be effective. Basically, it is a good indication of when a product should be discarded...     The key question is to know how has the product been stored? Have you kept it at all times at the conditions stated at the label? Was it under direct sunlight, exposed to humidity, frozen, overheated......??? Are the waranty seals open? Although the product may still be within its expiry date, this does not guarantee the effectiveness of a product that has not been stored properly... In certain exceptions, you can use some products for a short time after their expiry date has lapsed, but I would not recommend it without checking with the pharmacist before.     About giving the product away - normally institutions/charities don't accept it because they cannot guarantee the storage conditions nor the quality of the product. In case they do it, they have to re-test it to make sure it is OK for consumption.

To be an 'offical' babysittter the Swiss even offer an 'official' baby-sitting course.    
Otherwise, ask around in the various English-speaking institutions, like the English bookshops, English cafés, tourist centres, etc   
But if you live here then even just a smattering of German will help you get positions in various places, and you'll have the opportunity to improve your English   
You could even advertise in your local Migros for conversational English lessons, where you simply meet and chat with Swiss people who want to practise and improve their English with a local native English speaker.

Lob's right - this is the stuff that works. We just had our window wells (Lichtschachten) painted and first the painter sprayed the Mellerud which I think must be diluted, and the green just disappeared in a day, no scrubbing needed.    
If you do not have a drain on your balcony, using a power washer or steamer will present a drainage problem. So if you prefer not to use Mellerud, I would first check to see how you are going to rinse off the other products that have been suggested. They could cause damage if not rinsed.

			To the people who live in fribourgh.  I visited your town yesterday and absolutely fell in love with it.  I found the people extremely kind.   
Also, the international guitar performance was world class.   
For those who have time tonight here is some info:   
International Guitar Festival Fribourg, May 2-3,  Salle Fribourg - Église St-Jean 
This festival proves once again that small is beautiful with its final two concerts, not to missed by guitar aficionados. On Friday night, Cuban-born and internationally-renowned Eduardo Martín performs his own compositions, as well as those of fellow countryman, Leo Brouwer. Flamenco guitar great, El Niño de Pura from Seville, who has won every major flamenco award in Spain, stars in the festival finale on Saturday. His reputation for innovation within the long tradition of Andalucian gypsy music has brought him international acclaim.    
Tickets last night were only 30 CHF, a real steal.      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Dec 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Fribourgh & Guitar Performance	bluefish	Posts: 163

			The search function is your friend.    
There is a good watch maker on Todistrasse whose watches use the same movement as that found in many Omegas (Tags, etc). He works with several watch makers and will provide you with a better price and a more personal level of service that you will find on Bahnhofstrasse or directly with Omega.    
His details can be found here   .    
His watches are also very nice, excellent quality and reasonably priced...      "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2007	Groaned at 28 Times in 21 Posts	wrist-watch repair	cricketer	Posts: 1,193

			Javelwasser works really well on mildew. It's nothing more than bleach but removes the stains. It's also cheaper than the stuff in the fancy bottles. Try and open your window after every shower, and if you don't have a window in the bathroom, leaving the door open while you shower helps too. If things get really bad, insist that the landlord (or building owner) repaint your bathroom. This is what I finally did, and the problem disappeared.

			So you're tending to the professional side. The prints that we made were all scouting club projects. Hand-cut templates and single-colored prints.   I can't help directly in purchasing a screen printing machine but will ask for the company name anyway, maybe a friendly scouting-supporting company is willing to help you too. In the meantime you could search the web, especially Ebay and   for ""Siebdruck Rahmen"" and ""Siebdruck Maschine"". Good luck!

			hi there 
ex VDBP as off march 08 with 4 year old son   
clothes and toys are extra expensive, leave the bed linnen and buy Smile toys and other books. as well as basic clothes for YOU. kids clothes you will always buy and the choice here is AMAZING but adult underwear and generally all other clothes are expensive. 
i don't miss chutney or any of the normal brit stuff but the following i know you can't buy here... so that's what i packed...will be unpacking next weekend, will be able to tell you what survived the trip.   
the weather is like in cape town, 4 seasons in a day so you dress in layers. fest, shirt, light jacket, rain coat. the summers can get really warm and remember it's humid because of all the water, so it feels a bit like a cool Durban, i'm told...remember your swim stuff, under cover pools are great!!! so bring the sandals and the sunscreen... 
o ja, bring your umbrellas, you'll use them. 
there's nothing like listening to ...op 'n berg in die nag... as you're driving through the green swiss country side, i feel almost guilty about how happy i am...   
happy landings, spent 2 weekends ago in lausanne, all the magnolias are blooming, it's not called the swiss riviera for nothing.   
last thing...remember your sunny SA smile and bring all the oemf, you need it for all the day when you're really not up to trying to descipher the local legalise, setup your rss feeds to download madam & eve daily and remember you come from strong stuff. o ja, go for a nice facial and the works, that's the other thing i miss most...   
PM me for more kid things when you're here if you're interested...

If you care about scenery, Ulster has superb scenery, especially the coast which is magnificent and pretty uncrowded. But if you are sensitive to  climate you need to think carefully about N. Ireland vs Switzerland. There seems to be an awful lot of sky in Ulster. When the sun shines it's breathtaking over there. But when it rains there's a lot of grey. It's also quite windy. The other thing that get get you down are the short daylight hours in winter - 7 hours only which means a lot of dark. In Summer though it's light for 17 hours so that's a definite plus. Overseas travel is also a consideration if you plan to do a lot of it. N. Ireland can be expensive to fly to and from depending on your destination since you might have to route through Manchester or London, especially in Summer. For example Easyjet flies to Geneva in Winter but not Summer. If you've never been to Belfast I would recommend you spend a weekend there before you make your choice.

			Yes Rotel is also not bad.  Rotel is part of same 'group' that owns B&W I think.  A company I am associated with was trying to get direct access to the Swiss Distributer, but I need to chase the guy up on the status of this.   
Guess I also need to put an advert together and stick it in the classified section.  Mainly dealing with Home Automation, but also do Audio/Video stuff, including whole house audio and cinema solutions.

I have applied for studies in Geneva and Lausanne (particularly for the conducting Master course) and I am hoping to find here people who are studying (or have studied) in one of these two Conservatoires and could write about their experience of being students there.    
I will be glad if you could also tell me about opinions you have heard about them, without actually having studied there.   
Thanks!!

			Geneva has a free bike map which also happens to be the best walking map of the city.  It's got all of the bike shops marked on it:       
You can get a copy at the train station (luggage claim) or any of the bike shops.  Of the shops my favorites at the moment are BOSS in rue de Lyon, Hors Piste in rue du stand, and Hot Point in place de la Navigation.  For a used bike see Prêcot 13.

			The union in the Kleinbasel is very spacious and light and they have a few rooms one can rent (though it's quite expensive). Here's a list of their rooms:  .    
For something really classical, you should try one of the ""Zünfte"" (guildhalls). The main two would be the Safranzunft (Falknerstrasse,  ), which has several really beautiful old rooms and a huge hall, and the Schlüsselzunft (on Freie Strasse), which was recently renovated. I'm not sure if they have rooms to rent, but there is a restaurant.    
If you need something slightly cheaper, the Volkshaus at Claraplatz has several extremely reasonably priced rooms...but they're not particularly attractive.   
There's also a great space above the ""bar mitte"" in Gerbergasse, but I'm afraid I can't remember the name. You just go into the Mitte and up the stairs to your left and you're there.

Hopefully you don't need an expensive treatment - if so, a lot of people go abroad.

			Ok, so I went to 'Toni & Guy' in Geneva and .... well, I am really disappointed! One of the worst hair cuts I have   had! I will not name names, but whatever you do, do not go to a 'stylist' (as I sadly did, and regret it). If you go, do spend the extra 20 CHF and see a 'senior stylist', or the 'art director'. Better yet, go somewhere else. I will not go back! Overpriced and under-trained stylists!! Blah!    
Thankfully hair does grow!

			Just spoke to a sales rep about the service. They have 5000 customers now and they will not do anything with your mail unless instructed by you so you can have ""sensitive"" mail held and then shipped to you in bulk when you are ready, pretty cool. Their cost is $20 per month for up to 100 articles and that is less than forwarding mail, hands down.

			Yes, you need to find the local pharmacist that is most focussed on herbs and plants. I tend to find each city has one that has a lot, and most other pharmacists do not at all (they would only have mainstream teas). In Bern, there are two though, one is Dr Noyer Apotheke (they have raspberry leaf) and the other is Krauterhaus at the street called Bollwerk.   
So Zurich must have some too. If you really cannot find any, I am sure Dr Noyer would ship to you. I ordered lots of things, including more obscure thing like witchhazel bark from them and I like the quality of herbs so far.

			I recently had a card stolen and 1000 CHF drawn using Pin # which was remotely not kept along with the card. I reported immediately to the bank on card stolen and I was not asked any question or given a receipt # of this call. Later I was told that I am responsible for this transaction as pin was used. Interestingly I had other Australian cards and none were touched.   
I also filed police report, police has no way to do criminal investigation because interestingly this particular bank is saving money and has not installed cameras on their ATM's where thousands of CHF are kept. Throughout this process I found Bank here extremely arrogant and least of a help. I have now suspended this card and don't want to use any of the local cards in Switzerland.

			Hi,   
being a fan of good and long road trips, I decided to move our stuff myself from Zug to Finland through Germany, Denmark and Sweden.   
At the Singen borden (that is from Schaffhausen) I went to the toll building to do the paperwork (Zollamt). At the Swiss side everything went smoothly, I had my list of goods and they made me fill a form and stamped it. No worries. Next stop the German officials. They looked at my list and asked about the summer tires I had listed. They were for my car which was still in CH. The nice official said because of this I need a T1 form from a forwarding agent and should go around and ask for one in the next building. Of course the agents did not write anything to me, since they cannot guarantee what I am carrying. Back to the Germans I go. Since I was still returning to CH to pick up my car, I cannot be moving and I must go back they say. Since we had 3 drivers, I suggested that we go back and pick up the car as well and come back. At that moment he asked his manager if we could go. He gave us the green light right away and off we went.   
In my opinion this was unlawfull since I was moving to EU and carrying the goods myself. The car staying in Switzerland should have nothing to do with it. I guess the fellow had a bad day or just wanted to have some fun.    
Any experiences? Has anyone been asked for a German T1 form when they just drive through Germany to another country?

			It was the Auberge Paysanne which is in Lutter which is apparently not even in Switzerland but France.   
Just got to find out now whether the same people own it.   
It was a mother, father and daughter with her sons before.

			We ordered a large bed from Concord, which happens to be almost next door to our new home. Then we discovered the elevator is small, and the stairways are tight. The bed is the typical 2-parter, mattresses are 100x220.   
Concord simply said delivery was 130F. We're concerned whether they can even get it up the stairs (to the 6th floor!), and if they would turn around and charge us a fortune to bring in a hoist, like the movers will likely do. It doesn't help that the delivery charge is not in writing, of course.   
Anyone with any experience in this sort of thing? We tried to get Concord to change it to be the typical 200cm length, but they said it was too late (in spite of the fact it takes 4 weeks to get the bed). We'd prefer the extra length anyway.    
Also, we are wondering if Switzerland has a legal cancellation period for consumer contracts, as many places do (often called a ""cooling off"" period).    
Thanks!

			Not sure where in Zurich you live. My husband and I live in Baden and we often go to Famila in Walshut in Germany (about 20 min north from Baden). There you can find a huge selection of grocery and family-sized packages.    
Even with the appreciating Euro, we've still found pricing in general to be much better than those at Migro or Co-Op.  In addition, depending on the items you buy, you can get a VAT rebate of apprx. 15% of your total purchase.

The stuff in our place (in Gva) is entering old age and it seemed like such a shame/waste to leave all the new stuff behind ..... so plan was hatched to buy appropriately so it all fits in 'the spaces' when we're back in Gva ...  hence me being so cautious about F & P..

			Hi Richard,   
While I won't argue with you on your choice of sites for jewelry I tried to check your site but they wanted too much information before they will give you a price. It appears they want your data to diluge you with advertisement emails as many site do. Not my idea of a user friendly site.   
Check out these sites. Althought they are not in Suisse you may find they and other of this type sell watches at very attractive prices. I don't know what duties or other obligations a Swiss might have upon entry into the country but they, if any, would have to be factored into the price.         
Overstock sells approximately 100 brands of watches.    
Classy and conservative, this handsome IWC Portofino Ultra Thin Men's Silver Watch is the perfect addition to a sophisticated wardrobe.        $7100.00 $3150.01 (44%)           Similar discounts are available from   .   
They are certainly worth a look for the saving you may get. And best of all you can view the sites and all their contents without filling out a single form.

			Hello,   
I am the 5th year medical student in the Czech Rep. It has been few months when I started to seeking for a hospital training available for me in any of Switzerland´s hospital (of the french part cause I speak French and English, am available from mid May to Sept). Because it seems almost impossible, I was wondering to ask you guys for any useful advice.  
Till now I have received these types of reponses: 
- they have no place for summer training any more 
- they don´t provide it 
- they suggest me to contact IFMSA (I have already done it-but from the swiss as well as czech part I got negative answers) 
- two of them agreed to accpet me, but the problem appeared when they asked me for  le carnet ou des 4 formulaires pour  l'année d'études à option pour votre stage..that I could get at the Lausanne/Geneva university. But from there I was told to contact IFMSA again...
Is there any possibility how to manage it, cause I really don´t want than to have such a great experience even if not paid..It has been my dream to work in Switzerland after my studies, so this seems to me as a good note to my CV as well as a personal experience.. Btw. my boyfriend will be during the summer in Switzerland and very probably also after his studies, so another motivation to do anything possible..
Please, if any of u could give me an advice, I would me endlessly grateful cause at this moment am feeling kind of exhausted by such an afforce that I have alreday done..

			Hi,   
In Basel, a  is a kind of club whose purpose is to participate in Fasnacht - the festival that takes place each year in Basel starting the Monday after Shrove Tuesday and finishing on Thursday morning. Their instruments of choice are the piccolo and the drum and they play marching music.   
My clique - the   - is looking for new members to become piccolo players. If you don't play the piccolo already, perhaps you play a similar instrument like the flute.   
We are an all-male clique; the ""Runzle"" part is Baseldeutsch meaning ""wrinkles"" - i.e. most of our members are somewhat advanced in years and they like to take Fasnacht at a slightly more relaxed pace. As well as preparing for and participating in Fasnacht, the clique is also a social entity and we organise regular social events throughout the year.   
Getting involved in Fasnacht is the ideal way to integrate and socialise with the locals in Basel; and of course Fasnacht from behind a mask takes on a wholly different perspective. And it's a good way to learn a bit of Baseldeutsch.   
Now that Fasnacht 2008 is over, we will resume our regular Wednesday (the clue is in the name...) practice sessions in the autumn. These consist of meeting the other members at the cliquencäller (cellar) for a few beers and to practice some of the marches.   
If you're interested, drop me a private message or email our chairman - address on  .   
Cheers, 
Nick

			Going to check out the Swiss Lack shop recommended. If it's the same chain as the   site then they can mix NCS (Natural Color System) colors. A little google digging found me a site that can convert a RGB value to actual paint colors, and does so in a quite amazing way. Figured I'd post about it for the next person that comes along.    
Basically, I picked the colors I liked off   (US color brands) and then color-picked the little swatch to get the RGB color. Then I found   which is a completely insane page but quite a color resource. It linked to   where you can enter an RGB value, pick a color system (such as NCS or RAL (seems common in these parts)) and it will give you 4 best matches for that RGB value, and most of them were within 90% of the original color - or, close enough. Some were spot on.      : Swiss Lack can indeed do NCS. They're mixing the colors as I write this, ready for pickup later today. Seems like a great shop! I was in and out in 5 minutes as I already had all the color codes written down.

I've had a look at the Crumplers, and none of them really fit my need, which is to carry a laptop and some camera equipment. The bag needs to have a main inner compartment of at least 4 inches in depth after inserting a laptop into its compartment. It needs to fit one of these:     
On the other hand I don't want a bag that's too deep which sticks out from my body too much (my body is wide enough as it is).   
This one from Crumpler would have been great, except it's a bit too big in all dimensions - my laptop is a 13.3"" screen model.

			Make sure the power is off. Is it stuck ""on"" or ""off""? 
Unscrew the nut a few turns where it meets the fixture, try tugging on the chain again. If it does not retract, chances are the switch is broken and unless you can repair it yourself (electrician), it will cost more to have it repaired than a new fan.  
(Makes sure you tighten the screw again) 
Most electrical companies charge Fr.80/hr for repairs.

			You must be careful where the bathing suites are manufactured.  I am normally a size 34 to 36.  I bought a French bikini last year in a size 38.  French clothes are made French women, which I can only assume tend to be very small.   
Make sure you check the labels, sometimes there might be a table showing the differences in sizes and where it was manufactured.   
I have made the mistake several times of taking things that were way to small for me because I looked at the wrong size (for the french. . .again )

			When I moved here I couldn't fit everything in my suitcases so I had my sister ship my bed sheets, pillow cases and motorcycle helmet in a box. It cost her about $75 usd to ship it to me. She declared them as personal goods but had them insured for some odd $300. The Swiss tried to charge me 33.-  I refused to pay at the local post office and had it sent back to the main Post hub in Zürich for re-inspection. I had to call the Zürich hub to let them know it was coming back and that I wasn't going to pay for personal previously owned items.    
So with that said, if the same happens to you don't pay the charge unless you absolutely need said package immediately.

On the other hand, I can't fit into a lot of the stuff I bought at the beginning anyway, so I guess I'm not your best source of advice after all!!     
Good luck with everything!

			Hi!   
My husband and I are moving very soon in Basel. I'm a new mom-to-be and I'm excited to live my first pregnancy in Switzerland.    
I would like to meet pregnant woman or woman with kids. Our life style is changing, and I want to meet people who may have a similar life style. (Since we will not be seen going clubbing and partying.)    
I will be at home, and since I worked the last 15 years, it's quite a big change for me to not work. So to meet someone in a similar situation will be an easy way to get used to it. And it's always good to have someone with who you can share your experience in the motherhood area.

			if you've got a photo or a design to use, try Moo -   - based in the UK, ship internationally very quickly (turnaround should be less than a week) and make really funky printed things like invitations, cards, business cards etc.     
They've got some designs as well.  it's super easy to use their website.

			Ouch what a mess.   
It really sounds very fishy, and not exactly an auspicious start to what will need to be an ongoing relationship with the seller.  It doesnt sound like a fair deal anyway (high price, ongoing use etc), so once you add legal fees and aggro....   
I fully understand you have sunk money in the whole thing and have commitments, so this might not be possible, but tactically you might be better off threatening to (and being prepared really to) walk away from the deal.  It might work out cheaper and less emotionally draining in the end.   
Austria and France are nice places with mountains too!

			I have had a few problems with courier companies since I have been in Europe where they have given up on delivery far too easily and returned the item.  I had this worse when I was in Austria as the entrance to the flats I lived in was not the main entrance to the building (a shopping centre) but around the side.  I had to make sure I always gave detailed instructions and then hope that these instructions reach the driver.   
There is probably not much you can do with this order except accept the refund.  But for future reference it is important that you always get a tracking number on confirmation of the purchase.  Then with all the major courier companies you can track the package online.  The tracking info can be up to 24 hours out of date.  But at least you then know when they have attempted delivery so that you can contact them and make alternative arrangements.

			I second (or third) the comments already made. We have lived in both Geneva and Zurich with small kids and can honestly say we experienced no difference kid-friendly wise. I can't comment on Lugano as we have never lived there. Don't pay attention to sweeping generalisations like ""people in Geneva get bored"". Of course that's not true. That's just a reflection on the people saying those things. A friend of mine says only boring people get bored. It's also true that what is fun to some is torture to others but there aren't any significant leisure activities you can do in one and not the other.  However, because of size, culture and business mix the two cities have a completely different feel and naturally some folks will feel more in tune with one than the other.

			Another thing which (surprisingly) will make you stand out is to find out about the company.    . It amazing the number of people that don't do this.   
Is the company making money ? How much ? 
Where is it expanding ? 
How many people does it employ ? 
Who are the key clients ? 
Who are the competition ?   
Use the internet to search for accounts, company reports and references to this company. Make a scrap book -   Work it into the conversation:    
This for me sorts out the real candidates from the also-rans.

Or you could take the pic to somewhere like Pfister here and see if they can get it for you - I've done that with some rugs I saw - they were the same price both here and the UK

			The forum has been busy during my absence! A late happy new year to you all.   
This time I celebrated in Amsterdam where the fireworks at New Year's Eve are much more... accoustic and dangerous than here   People spontaneously transform side streets into no go-areas and light up ten minutes worth of bangers. Drunkards who can't throw farther than their toe-caps don't percieve this as a reason to stop the fun and I've even observed a cyclist who lighted and threw a banger while driving freehanded!   
Then we went to the party of a friend-of-a-friend where much beer and prosecco was served but no water or cola sighted, and got some ideas for new year's resolutions.

			Lou did the right thing by acting swiftly. I am a moderator on two other e-forums and we were forced to brush up on case law regarding e-libel following a complaint - we had one poster whose sole purpose in life appeared to be getting himself sued by posting libellous stuff. Our complaint came right after the Mumsnet / Gina Ford case, where Mumsnet   for a GBP five figure sum.   
Our research suggested we would not be held automatically responsible for comments on the forum if:   
We acted swiftly on any complaint 
We had a fair-use policy that posters read before they could post 
We had an effective moderation policy (which does not necessarily mean a moderator reads every post)   
This was enough to satisfy our insurers anyway!   EF is an excellent forum, it would be a shame to see it endangered because of something someone wrote, but you moderators do such a good job I doubt that will ever happen.

			Many proverbs that are common in the German speaking part of Switzerland are known in Germany and Austria, too. These two are limited to Switzerland:   
Swiss German: Me chan nöd de Föifer und s Weggli ha. 
High German: Man kann nicht den Fünfer und das Brötchen haben. 
English: One can't have the fiver and the bun (fiver meaning the 5 Rp. coin) 
Equivalent proverb: You can't have your cake and eat it too.   
Swiss German: De Gschider git na, de Esel blibt sta. 
High German: Der Klügere gibt nach, der Esel bleibt stehen. 
English: The wiser concedes, the donkey doesn't move. 
Equivalent proverb: The wiser head gives in.        They are called Feuersteine (fire stones) in German and to my knowledge contain sayings in both German and French.

			Banks don't tend to accept coins for foreign exchange. The big reason is that coins are heavy and expensive to store and transport for their intrinsic value, compared to notes. Their margins would have to change if they started accepting foreign coins.   
The banks also must centralise and repatriate the coins to the originating country so that they can get ""real"" money for it. eg let's say you've got a pocket full of Jordanian JOD coins from a trip. If you sell it to the bank, they then have to somehow securely transport them back to Jordan in order to onsell it and convert it back to CHF, and the price for doing this would have to be built into their exchange rate somehow. It is extremely unlikely that someone else here will come along wanting to buy the same pocket full of shrapnel. It's a very one-way function.   
Arguably, with a major ""nearby"" currency such as EUR the rules could be slightly different.   
Another option is, how about popping along to a big bank money exchange at eg Zurich airport? The branches there would be used to seeing lots of odd currencies, and as there's regular US flights they probably a) get asked the question frequently and b) could probably re-sell the coins?

			PS: Part time versus executive. They are graded on diferent scales . Normally an executive MBA has more years of work experience than a full time MBA ( which is around 2 years) . that means MBAs apply for starter jobs whereas executives go for experienced hire . Everthing else being equal, I heard from a headhunter that full time MBA is more preferred as you obviously take more classes or spend more time at school so better networking opportunities. But honestly it is the schooll that counts, not  the program.

			I am not sure about red, but there is a dance clothing shop in Zug. PM me if you would like me to go and check out if they stock that colour. Alternatively try ebay. I got our daughter's dress for her school play in there. Also, look in H&M, they do some ballet type gear.

Ending contracts/leases: To terminate any type of contract you need to write a letter saying so. When sending these letters make sure you get the ""track and trace"" service that requires the receiver to sign. This enables you to PROVE that you sent the letter. general end of contract letter format      
Things that require a terminating letter:  Not completely sure about when the proper time to terminate the following:  Of course I'm probably forgetting some things but at this point...I still need to do a lot of the stuff on the list soooooo....Any help is appreciated!!

			Hi,   
public transport is rarely a problem in Switzerland but as there are so many resorts of varying size it's difficult to know which would suit you best.   
This website will tell you a bit more about some of the larger (and well renowned) resorts in Switzerland and the rest of the world, and should give you a greater clue which will cater best to your expectations and requirements      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Nov 2007	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Skiing in Switzerland help (oYo)	chicagowaxy	Posts: 39

			Read the threads on apartments and look at the websites to get an idea of what is on the market in the area you will want to live. How long will largely depend on how demanding your requirements, how restrictive your budget and how lucky you are in finding someone who choses you if places are in demand.   
I'd also recommend getting 3 or 4 moving quotations so you know those exact costs end to end and point to point, including custom clearing, insurance, packing/unpacking, etc.   
I've never heard of a company giving an ""allowance"" - I always had them cover my moving costs, temporary accomodation, a trip to look for a place and airfares for all of it.

However, beware--they do not cover the mark, but rather remove it, along with whatever is beneath it.  It re-surfaces whatever you use it on, so you have to be really careful and not rub too hard.   It also will only work on a smooth wall, not one of the highly-textured-knucke-and-knee-busting walls that I have encountered in some apartments here.

			Actually, I disagree with most of these posts.  The people at good universities in the US know what schools are good abroad, and will judge you accordingly.  I followed my advisor from Caltech to ETH/Eawag (Swiss federal water research institute), and all of the top U.S. researchers in the field (1) know where I am and (2) are jealous.  This could be field-specific, but if ETH has any sort of reputation for computer science like it does for most sciences, you're so much better off there than Dallas or Minnesota...I have to admit that I haven't heard of Dallas University, and I always heard of Minnesota as being a party school.   
As far as a job goes, my impression after 4 months in Switzerland is that there are way more jobs available in the U.S. than Europe, especially if you want to go into academia.   
Good luck deciding where to go!

			You can also come to the embassy in Bern if you're up for a day trip. No appointment needed, but you do have to go in the morning - like 9 to 11:30       
(There's also more info on the consular offices in Zuerich and Geneva)     
We were just there last month when we sold our house. All you need is your passport, money and the docs (unless you represent a business). There's hardly any wait either. It's $30 for the first notary signature and $20 for each subsequent one for the same event. You can pay cash or credit, US$ or CHF. I can't remember if they take amex though.    
My guess is that if you're dealing with something in the states, and especially the great state of NC, they're going to want a ""regular"" notary (I'm being sarcastic here), none of ""that foreign stuff.""    
Probably this week is a bit of a mess with Thanksgiving though.

The past few years, I saw Tommy rarely on the US East Coast and thought it was passé. The stuff here does look more conservative though. The Tommy clothes I saw in California in late 90s looked like walking advertising with 10-inch-high 'Tommy' letters or logos.

			I am looking for lactose free milk that is Bio as well. I cannot find it anywhere (neither in shops nor Google), and even though Coop and Migros have lactose free milk, none of them are bio produced. I do not want to switch to non-dairy milk like rice, almond, soy or oat milk so if anyone knows whether you can get this bio lactose free milk anywhere, thanks  "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: May 2006	Groaned at 3 Times in 3 Posts	Lactose free Bio milk?	muze7	Posts: 1,205

I didn't really know where to post this, pardon if this is the wrong place.    
I'm a broker in zurich, and have met a lot of frustrated people looking for apartments etc... so I made a blog to try to help fill the gap of swiss real-estate information on the internet.  
Here it is:

			I think the main difference between watches is: quartz or mechanical. All the Wenger watches are quartz watches, that means their time keeping mechanism is based on a quartz crystal. The more expensive watches (IWC, Omega, Rolex) are based on mechanical movement to keep time, that's exactly why they are more expensive. Mechanical watches need to be serviced now and then. Quartz watches, in theory, should run forever without service.

			We have a Zug Adornia (or something). I didn't realize it didn't have an exhaust till I read this forum, but I went downstairs and looked and there was no exhaust!  D'oh. I think there is a hose that empties out the tank into a drain - I just empty the lint screen. There is a light that comes on if the tank is full, but it's not come on in 2 months.    
At any rate, it takes about 1-1.5 hours to dry a big load. Towels are the worst. The washer gets our stuff really clean, but I'm just not used to the small capacity  - where I used to put 6-8 towels in my machine in the US, I can fit 3 here, and it can take up to 1.5 hours to dry them. I have found that if I centrifuge (spin) them at a higer rate before I dry them, they dry faster.

I don't think they do specially-themed candy though, with candy corn and that sort of thing like you'd see in the US (and thank god for that). You'd have to go for a few bags of mini-chocolate bars or whatever that are available year-round.

			Hi there,   
I have a DS Lite and have it set up for Wifi, but only using my wifi router at home. You need an unsecured connection, or details of the WEP key or whatever in order to configure. Most wifi connections around here are secured - ie you need to buy a subscription to use them. I am not sure this type would be any use to you on the DS.   
Feel free to PM me if you want to get heads together to troubleshoot further.

			I've gone to a few events that were in front of my doormat (Cana Bar and Talacker Bar). Out of curiousity and because it's a welcome change to my spare time routine. It was a bit overwhelming at the beginning but now it's nice to know a few faces of users here. But the real reason why I come to the bar evenings is to impress everybody with my accent free English   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Mar 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Have you ever attended English Forum events?	kfcfriend	Posts: 143

			Zug station has them one day late - except for the inevitable European edition of the Financial Times - itself a farce since the 'news' it contains is only added to around midday the previous day......There is some serious money to be made in supplying Zug with up to date English newspapers.

			Hello - first posting.  Love what I've seen so far of the Forum.  Ran through all the postings related to shipping things from the US to Geneva but I'm interested in learning more about mailing using the US Mail service or an alternative courier (UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc.)   
We have a temp move to Geneva coming up (one year) and will be staying in a furnished apartment.  So the biggest issue is clothing and personal belongings.  A decent amount of heavy luggage will help but I still foresee needing to ship seasonal items over a few months after we're in Geneva.  I can leave boxes with family in the States to mail/ship but having perused the shipping posts, it's clear the costs are exorbitant if we consider an international mover.   
Has anyone had experience simply using a standard shipper from the US and if so, any details would be great.   
Thanks.

			Yes Ikea does have one for 10chf white in colour the range of length is from 110cm to 200 cm.  Instead of twisting out you have to pull it out (it has springs.. I spent quiet some time twisting it and realized you just have to pull out ....there are directions in the packet.) .   
You will find it in the area where there are shower curtains .. against the wall ( I bought mine last week from Dietlikon Ikea.)

			We are currently in Zürich, and my husband grew up in the Bern area. I was recently researching the Bern area as we are planning to move there (eventually). Based on my research I would say that there is probably slightly more available in Zürich than Bern in terms of the expat mom meet-up thing, but I was surprised at the number of options I found in Bern. I found play groups, music classes, Gymboree, etc.    
In Zürich there are probably more things overall, but maybe spread out over a larger area, so depending on where you are, and whether you have a car, it can take up to an hour to reach them. But you could definitely be meeting up for coffee or a playgroup every day of the week if you wanted to here. If you are really looking for a lot of expat based kid opportunities in one place, lots of people like the   in Uster.    
Zürich is of course the bigger city and has a different feel when you walk around downtown. Rent is higher here, but depending on your field, so are salaries. It really comes down to personal preference I guess.    
Best of luck with your decision. Check out the   section of the forum. There are a lot of threads there discussing opportunities with kids.

			Hi Bravesocks - last year I spent less than 80 chf (8.90 chf for one) at Landi in Brugg and bought 8 WindHager DIY fly screens. Best investment I have made for ages. 
It is a little messy cutting the tape and sticking it to the insides of the window which you then press the net onto - little like Velocro. 
The end result was that the insect population (including those annoying mossies) dwindles dramatically. Most insects now come in the front door or through the cellar door when it is opened. 
There are much more VERY expensive methods available - permenant screens etc, but my method involves only an occasional inspection to see if the ""seals"" are intact.    
I bought a couple of replacement black nets over the internet from the UK - these were stronger, but a little more expensive with the postal charges. 
It you need - I can fish out this firm also. 
Hope it helps - the sleep quality for our family was much improved after this small project

			Hubby just picked up a pair of last year's model of skis for less than half the retail (retail > 1000 CHF, bought them for 500) at Ochsner Sport in Zug.  Apparently they are planning on bringing in the new models next week.  Of course, he was sucked into waiting to buy a new model for me--""No, really, there have been a lot of new developments in women's beginner skis this year....""     
Probably a good time to pick up a pair, if you ski enough to make it worth buying rather than renting.

			If your GF wants to work in her field, she may find it difficult, depending on her level of German fluency, and what certifications she does or doesn't hold. My hubs' best friend (Swiss) has a German girlfriend who moved here last year. She works in the same field. She is a native German speaker and still found it challenging to find a place (she did eventually and loves her job). I do know that all the Swiss employers she contacted were very insistent on a certain certification - I don't know the name/acronym. But there is some exam you can take and obtain this certification, and that was pretty much a must, in addition to fluency in German.   
Best of luck as you consider your options.

			I have recently moved to Switzerland and am staying in Walchwil in the Kanton of Zug. I have a kiln which I use for glazing ceramics and fusing and slumping glass. I am keen to find a supplier of unglazed bisqueware which I can use to paint with underglazes and later fire with a transparent glaze. Does anyone know where I could buy this from and perhaps other supplies e.g. underglazes, glazes etc.   
Thanks

They'll collect old electronic goods from companies for free. You just have to fill in a form and they'll drop off a pallet which they'll pick up again after the time you defined.        
Private customers can simply take their old electronics to any store where similar products are sold. Mediamarkt in Basel, for example, has a two large containers where you can just go by and throw in your stuff.

Effectively they are charged enormous surcharges for paying into a Swiss bank account and they are charged 19% VAT on clothes. Books is only 7% VAT I recall. What you might find very useful is a ""Kinderkleiderbörse"" where you can also sell books or toys even prams. They occur about every 3 to 6 months and there will be one near you soon...

			The big question is do u get reloaction allowance or shipping costs from the comapny?? Furniture here is very expensive unless u want IKEA kinds. We shipped our entire furniture ( comapny paid for the shipping, the shipping cost was more than the furniture's ). I am sure I couldn't afford good furniture over here. If u have good stuff with you which u love and it is not too expensive to ship, bring it over is my suggestion.   
PS u may need to know roughly the size of accomodation u will land up getting, if ur furniture is bulky.    "	slipped a little	Join Date: Mar 2007	Groaned at 2 Times in 2 Posts	To buy or not to buy[Furniture]	Tanya	Posts: 178

Of course, there is no mention of the massive amounts of oil money funding Hamas, supplying rockets to bombard Israel, etc.

The article said that it simple enough to *buy* somewhere for the Palestinians to live and set them up - but where then would the martyrs come from.

			Hi all,   
I am looking to find some yodelling lessons somewhere around the Zurich area. Does anyone have any recommendation for good schools? And what sort of rates are generally charged. I have some experience with singing hip hop and reggae and I guess yodelling will be the next big challenge for me. I'm also interested in hearing any experiences people have had trying to learn yodelling.   
Thanks for any comments and feedback.

			You won't find many (if any at all) furniture shops in town. If you have a car, then venture out to Ikea, Dietlikon etc.   
Clothes for expecting mums - your best bet is H&M just off Bahnhofstrasse (behind BIG, opposite C&A, Jelmoli, Manor -depending where you're standing). There are some other special shops with nicer clothes, but they'll be expensive - I don't know names, so google for ""Schwangerschaftsmode"" or ""Umstandsmode""   
If you want to splash out on some really nice baby clothes at a reasonable price, then go to Du Pareil au Meme on Rennweg - they've just renovated and have got some lovely things in at the moment. Although, there's one in Basle too, as far as I know.

			Hi Phil, 
I spent 3.5 years living in Schaffhausen having just left in December of last year. I can give you my experiences if you want.   
I am English, married to an English guy with 2 kids who were 4 and 3 when we arrrived there. (We have since been relocated since the company closed but are now living in Ontario Canada.)   
We lived in the Klettgau area to the west of schaffhausen in a small village. It was lovely and the countryside was beautiful. Our neighbours were lovely and spoke high german to us. (We learned german for 4 years). They knew we were trying to learn German so they were very patient with us. Schaffhuuse german is somewhat different, but seems easier enough to pick up for german people. Even I could pick up some of it. I spoke high german.   
Our kids went to the International school since we weren't sure how long we would be there. There are lots of Swiss kids in the school there. The international school has regular hours from 8 to 3.30 daily (I know it has or is changing, but regular schools can have different hours on different days). 
The school is great but obviously does not give you local friends.  
Our son played at the local football club and was making friends that way.   
Being apart from your extended family - well that can happen in the same country. Would you miss them too much?    
Schaffhausen is a very small city. You soon get to know people and recognize people. It is also very beautiful with fantastic facilties for kids. The swimming complex is wonderful (KSS at Breite) and the ice rinks are good. It's very safe for kids as another poster said.   
We were very happy there and were sad to leave.   
Personally (I'm not wanting to start any arguments!), in comparision I do not like Singen. It is quite industrial. SChaffhausen is very pretty. If your wife would feel more comfortable in Germany though, it is a good option. There are direct SBB and DB trains from schaffhausen station and of course the swiss transpoprt system is wonderful. ( We never had 2 cars - just a bus pass). 
And for shopping we always went to Lidl/Aldi with the border guards asking if we had been shopping every time! They soon got to know faces.   
There are always downsides though - yes we had to start from scratch again and build up new friendships but there are some lovely people in Schaffhausen.  Unilever have also decided to make a large HQ there and so there are loads of international people there. (Cilag/unilever etc are all in the area).  It is very cosmopolitan.   
Anyway, if you want to know anything else, lmk.   
Heidi

I've broken my degree(s) and continuing ed classes into hours (not counting the 'yoga' course etc., I took in my 4th year to round out elective requirements) to grease the skids a bit.  Hopefully I won't need to spend 'hours' on the phone with them at 3 CHF per minute (haha).   
Is faxing them a letter a reasonable way to go?  I notice there is a fax number there.  Any additional insight you have would be appreciated.

			I'm not sure of the accuracy, but this site has some pretty useful tools.         
You can force it to follow roads, or just point to point from where you click.  It will also show the altitude along your route.   
Hope this helps, and good luck!

Once they start going to school and spending time away from home you have no supervision. Indicating to a kid that there is something they shouldnt see automatically increases their desire to see it and with todays technology you just cant control it.   	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	public perceptions...	nyair24	Posts: 1

			Yeah, I'll definitely look for something with a common washing machine or an apartment which has one of its own. Thanks for the good tip about the mini-machine - will look in to that.   
I figured out there is one machine in the house where I live - but with one program/temperature only...well, I guess it'll do until I find my permanent place... definitely a ""push""-factor, though.

			As Polarise says,   should certainly be on the list.    
My wife had a major operation and a long stay in hospital 6 years ago and still has to attend every month for medication. The standard of treatment has been excellent and all the medial staff so friendly and efficient. The bills, which are fully itemised, are paid without question and now exceed everything we have both paid in the last 17 years, so weve not complaining about our premiums !   They say that premiums are lower in other European countries but when you look further you find they have large deficits being carried forward which, one day, they will have to address.

			Hi, This exact issue was shown in Desparate housewives recently where the guy got most of his money back even though there was an engraving. The store said they'd refund less a fee to remove the engraving.   
I would have taken the 30% deduction as unfortunately it was completely in your discretion to get something else for your niece. The shop has in fact given you two options at its discretion: credit note to full amount or refund less a percentage, probably reflecting their margin.    
The previous posts reflect the law (versus practice) that goods can only be refunded if faulty, otherwise if brought back within a reasonable time against a credit note/exchange. But take heart, Switzerland is slowly becoming a consumer society with practices aligning to the boom economy reality in UK and Ireland.

The machines read up from the bottom line and left to right so it produces a logical sequence: town, road, number.

			o.k. i did a very big search 
so here are my findings from the summer i too was looking for a dog 
1) what kind of dog do you want? 
you can contact breeders, you can even go to Germany where the prices are lower 
do you want a pure bred or mixed? 
I chose mixed because i thought they tend to be healthier  
and smarter..i always had a mixed. 
if a breed , which kind?  
do you have a lot of time ? do you need a quiet dog? 
I have a mixed jack russel and dackel 
i think jack russels would have been too active for me.. 
dackel or dacheshund are in my opinion the sweetest and smartest small dogs 
i love the long haired dackel version, the ones i have met have great personality though i think personally they are not so cute as the short hair. 
female or male? 
i was afraid of fights so chose a female 
i got mine through the internet i searched under   and got a list of shelters that have dogs. 
i originally wanted an older dog  but  they tend to have  a history and i have children so i got a  4 month old puppy who was the quietest dog there..i wanted quiet 
 still i have had to move because the stupid neighbors (with a cat) complained about the dog, she tended to cry when left alone for an hour  
so then the landlady lied  and said she never gave me permission  
so GET A WRITTEN PERMISSION TO HAVE A DOG before you get one! 
if you rent get a dog that does not bark a lot, dacheshund do not bark a lot, i wanted to get a labrador but they need a lot of exercise and training 
so i got a small dog. 
I would say that you could play it safe and go to a breeder but first  
read about dogs and  figure out WHAT YOU WANT, google  for dog info.  in English  and  once you know what you want then search even online for  the various breeds 
talk to people that have dogs 
ask about breeds 
I recommend taking a dog from an animal shelter because it feels good to give a dog a home, there is nothing sadder than a homeless dog

			PCDesigns, tomcat, christian macek and MAR25: THANK YOU! I didn't even think about hiring someone from Switzerland!   
swissbob: David and I were planning on moving to Switzerland next year to be near his parents...plus we're kind of bummed 'bout the US health care system, political situation and all that stuff. We are both peaceful open minded artists and my trip to Switzerland brought only warm, kind, open and loving people my way (a lot of them did ask 'bout Bush and when I rolled my eyes and said talk to the hand they all laughed). David's father passed away in June and knowing we were gonna move in 2008, he decided to leave us his chalet. 
David's mom is still there so are many friends, the quality of living is higher and I really loved it....oh and on a side note, the comic book stores in both St. Gallen and Zuerich want us to do a book signings...we have six books coming out! FUN!

Start with the   - I guess you've been the site already but if you call you should get an English speaker.      Not quite - you need to send your breed club certificate to the Swiss kennel club for your breed and they will issue a Swiss cert. Then you can enter competitions.   
What do they mean by shown? Could you just enter a Mutts show? No certificate required?

			Did you find your band yet? I play with a new band (Nightshift) based in Zug that may be what you want (new band, but experienced players). Ask anyone who was at International Day at ISOZ this year to get an idea of what we've done so far.   
We play a lot of blues-based stuff like Van Morrison, Joe Cocker, Rolling Stones etc., but range out to Reggae, early Rock n' Roll (yes, danceable), RnB, Rock n' Soul, etc. With keyboard and sax, we could even do a quiet first set. The only style I haven't played in a long time at a wedding is classical - not since I played the Mozart Clarinet concerto at my own wedding. And, I haven't played in a Polka band since college in Michigan.   
If this isn't what you want, but you're still looking, I'll put you in contact with someone who knows the local English music scene intimately. Drop me a note...

			Hello ScientistMel - the ones I have been describing are the brown night variety. 
Don't get me wrong - I do not want to decimate every insect in sight - just do a bit of thinning out. Part of my garden is a ""wild reserve"" - so they are more than welcome to eek out their life cycle there. Once my hedge begins to mature a little more then I will leave them alone.   
I wish I could do a job like yours - it sounds much more full-filling than sitting behind my computer looking after other peoples endless database problems.  
Insect control must be a subject where you can actually see quantify-able results and your customers really appreciate your efforts. It is just the Latin which would cause me a problem. 
The investigation and experimental elements of your work would really appeal to me. 
Since I have had my garden, my whole perspective on (pond) life has altered. 
I think there will be many more insect/garden related posts in the future. I have already written something about cockroaches

If there is licensing issues with SQL Server what about SQL Server Express (or MSDE) - how many users will you have?  If you are finding Access slow (which is highly likely) maybe you should consider FoxPro.  It's free to distribute (you only need to pay for the development licence) and is incredibly fast on index queries, plus is really easy to program and loads of really usefuly functions (far more than SQL Server) for data manipulation.  	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	IT Books	zuriguy	Posts: 91

			In all fairness, I believe you should be able to go into somewhere like Christ and show them what the problem is. The can ensure that it will be repaired correctly and charge a lot for the repair since it was not sold by them!!! 
Seriously though, most jewelers can help you, just make sure you get a proper receipt before you leave the store! (Maybe take a photo of it incase of loss or theft!)

A good book I have read (and reread) is Target Switzerland - Swiss Armed Neutrality in World War II by Stephen P. Halbrook     
Another good resource is a DVD in French called La Suisse pendant la guerre - I have part 1 1940-1942 so there must be a part two. Its a collection ofshort newsreels that were shown weekly in Swiss cinemas from 1940 through to 1975.

 there are doctors who specialise in rehab, however so far I`ve only met those who have specialised in specific fields such as stroke/neurology/cardiac who are based at private clinics such as Valmont or Genolier. The Orthopaedic Hospital at CHUV may well be able to point yoi in the right direction.

			I can concur on the ""Engerling / Maikaefer"" thingies - our garden (also Flumserberg) was reduced to a mass of what looked like mole hills and my husband was getting very excited about the prospect of doing a bit of mole hunting, when a neighbour confirmed if was actually local foxes digging for the grubs.   
Apparently they are somewhat of a fox delicacy.... have to say having dug one up by accident the other weekend I was inclined to scream and run very quickly for the old man to rehouse it!  in my defence it was quite large and very wriggly

			Hi Magdalena,    
St. Gallen is a nice place - quiet, small, scenic, quaint little city centre and plenty of cafes and restaurants etc. - basically a normal swiss town!    
Trains are pretty regular to Zurich, but it does take 90mins to the centre of Zurich. I know a few people who commute in either direction and although it is certainly possible, I personally wouldn't do it. Adding on any extra time for buses or walking could make it a slightly long commute.    
Maybe living in Gossau, Wil, Winterthur etc. might be a better option with a shorter commute and still close to SG?

			In Bern, the only two shops where one can buy diode, cable, resistors and such. One is situated directly opposite the backery in Märziili and the other is in Bümpliz.   
The one in Märzilli is small but the guy who runs it is very helpful whereas the one Bümpliz is huge but one of the guy who stands behind the counter has a ""Mr. Know-It-All"" attitude.

			I agree with your friend, money does talk. I go to a private range just to put a few rounds thru my Kel Tec (it's not a range pistol), but I usually end up pumping out a few hundred rounds on someone's 6 shooter or 9mmer. The problem for me with the private range is that there's limited space so you have to make a reservation a few weeks inadvance.

			If this was for personal use, I doubt this would present any problems at all. Normally they are concerned that you might be bringing in more than 500g of meat (think of all those poor, starving Swiss farmers), but I doubt they'd make a problem about a box of spices.   
Of course there also another possibility - you could try asking them?

I've noticed, that if it isn't much and you can pack it in packages up to 20 kilo, the normal post  ( ) isn't a bad option. it is 178 for 20 kilo's + some extra costs for insurance.   
also with the flight you are taking, which airline are you going with? and in case you are flying business, with BA, you can take for example 3x 23 kilo pp. klm gives you 30% discount on bying extra bagage space when you do this beforehand.

			The Obi link was handy.  The term I should have been looking for was ""Meitgeräte"" for machine hire.  I'm always wary of buying domestic tools as they are usually vastly inferior to the professional tools.  As I'm no DIY god (nor interested in becoming one), owning the stuff doesn't seem a good use of money nor storage space.   
There's an Obi in Bülach which is near me and something to checkout in the near future.

			Hi all,   
Apologies if this is taken as hijacking the thread; if so mods, please feel free to let me know and I'll start a new one.   
I've been browsing these forums extensively and have seen numerous references to people having trouble with laundry timetables etc. My wife and I are considering a move to Geneva/Lausanne and she was horrified to learn that we might have to live in a place where we don't have all our own appliances, incl a washing machine/dryer.   
My question is: it seems from all the posts here that it is the norm in CH not to have your own washing machine in your flat. However, it's my understanding that most EF users are living in the German-speaking part of CH, so is it the norm in Romande to not have private washing facilities/a washing machine in your own flat? Do you have to own your own house/flat to have this ""luxury""?   
Thanks in advance

			Hi,   
I had a recent expeirience of this buying a place.   
The previous owners wanted more than we were prepared to offer, and what the bank (UBS in this base) suggested was a good price.  However, the bank would still lend us the money.  The risk to them is almost neglible when you put down a 20% deposit.   
We did not buy the place in the end, but accept the bank's suggested price as no more than a guideline.  Recently, buying prices have gone up, there is no escaping this.  You must make the decision of what you are prepared to pay, and if the owner will not accept that offer then walk away.  AbFab is 100% correct in this respect - it's worth what someone will pay.  On another place I looked at, I got outbid by other people as the owner put up the place for two low a value.....   
I don't know if you have a saleman in the picture here or not.  In our case we did, and the saleman kept us absolutely in the picture and ended up selling us anohter place in the same road that better suited us in any case.   
Good luck!!!

			Sorry, can't help with a location of a hose. However, do make sure that you use the hose sparingly and try to get the bike as dry as possible after hosing it down. Also, don't spray anything high pressure anywhere near where your bearing seals are located.   
Instead of a hose, I prefer to wait until the bike is dry, then use a set of bike brushes ( , you can get them from any good bike shop) to brush the mud away - the proper brushes are especially good at getting to the hard to reach places. After that, I use some spray-on bike cleaner (which you can get at the Migros Sport XX or a real bike store); leave it on the frame for 2 minutes, then wipe clean with a cloth. Then make sure the chain still has some oil on it. This method works pretty well and doesn't leave any water where it shouldn't be.

			Check out this guy: ""Maglia rosa"" Reto Maissen Mittlere strasse 24 4056 Basel. Tel: 061-261-4355. I've been going to him for about 10 now and he does a good job with good prices and he speaks english very well. It's a small shop and he works alone. Plus he rides road and mountain.

The visa waiver is valid for 3 months IIRC.

Those prices are DOMESTIC btw.

			hi there   
Does anyone know of a good site for buying tickets to the Rugby World Cup?    
Euroteam.info has all the games, but their prices seem incredibly expensive. Their music ticket prices are also out of kilter - for example Gwen Stefani in Hallenstadion they have for EUR 240, whereas ticketcorner.ch has the same seats for CHF 84...   
cheers

			Hi there.  I'm going to be in Zurich for 6 weeks and will have some time on my hands.  I will be going to Physician Assistant school as soon as I get back to the States.  I am interested in volunteering at a clinic or hospital.  The thing is I really don't speak German (which I am going to try to learn - anybody recommend a good school or other method?).

			Hello, I am doing some research for my German A-level, and i would be very grateful if you could answer some questions of mine. Although my research is primarily within Germany itself, it's extended to German speaking countries, so I have been looking at this for Austria and Switzerland too.   
1) In schools in Switzerland, do you study the Brothers Grimm in either history or Literature, at any age? 
2) Are the Brothers Grimm well known?

			Ive been to both of them, in fact we still go to the baby music, so I can def recommend that! And the babys lounge as well, is very handy as its a cafe thats totally geared up for children but also actually does quite nice food for adults as well while the little ones play!   
Anyway, good luck with your househunting, I know its a bit of a nightmare but hopefully ypou will get lucky! and geneva is a very nice place to live with litle ones, its so easy to get around and has great parks etc, especially in summer as there are loads of nice outdoor pools and the lake etc.   
let us know if youve got any other geneva qs (not that Im an expert of course!) but have done lots of child related stuff here!!!

			If you do a simple bbc search you can find many news stories to confirm what I have said. also the AIMS site is also un-impressed with the actions of many HV's and social workers. I know there are some well meaning people in the system, but the way it's set up is wrong.   
I'm not too bothered with washing stuff as I will make sure I have my son, flushing after 10pm, well I've read if it's needed then it's not a problem. Also I assume if your in a new bldg you won't hear as much as an older one. I know I lived in a brand new bldg. in a very rich part of LA, I heard EVERYTHING my upstairs neighbors did! So rules can be a good thing

			hello - wasn't too sure where to post this!   
we are having a familiarisation trip to geneva next week prior to moving out there in july. does anyone have any tips/ideas for what to see/do to get an impression of real life in geneva?   
we're having a tour of some of the local areas as we don't know where we will be living yet. will be looking at some examples of accomodation.   
we think we'll go grocery shopping (not your average city break activity!) but not sure what else to do (apart from touristy things).   
as background: we have a 6month old baby girl and i'll be a stay at home mother while we're in geneva.   
many thanks

			I may be moving to the UK over the next couple of months and I was wondering if anybody could give me some advise about the tax situation there... i.e. is there any way/set up to be able to avoid being hummered by the tax autorities? I will most probably not get an expat deal - will be hired by the london branch permanently...    
Though I heard that for a period of time, if you travel a lot (which is the case) you can avoid being taxed on the days you spend out side the country...?    
Any help/advise on this matter is very much appreciated.

			I went drill crazy in the flat. There were holes left from previous tenants that had been filled. There was never any mention of these.   
I plan to do just that when I leave, plug all the holes with polyfiller (white paste) or whatever the local equivalent is.   
I think it also depends on how rigorous the agency's inspections are.

			The tv I would forget about. The tv signal is different here than in the us and you would need a big transformer just to run it. The bikes are worth looking at. If they are nice bikes it could cost you quite a bit to replace them here. I've noticed on the site that alot of people have ordered bikes from the us or other places and paid shipping on it and it cost less than it would to buy it here.   
I just moved here recently and shipped most of a household, minus most of the electronic stuff. I kept a few things and bought transformers because it would have cost much more to replace them.   
Alot of things are more expensive here than in the us.

			If your friend wants to be a CELTA-qualified English teacher, then they need to complete a CELTA teacher-training course.    
They can do this one month full time, or part-time split over a few months.    
The website   has more information on the course and where it can be completed in Switzerland.    
Note: the course seems to be a lot more expensive in Switzerland compared to other countries.   
There are some other threads in this forum on CELTA - maybe they would have some usefull information for your friend also.

			If you break it into pieces it will end up costing you much more since you have to pay for that garbage anyway. I see that you have two options, depending on where you live:   
1. Take it to your recycling center. You will have to pay by weight, but probably a little cheaper than you were quoted. 
2. If you use stickers for the rubbish you may be able to place the appropriate number of stickers on it and put it out for collection. Instructions can be found usually on the sheet of stickers itself, or with the instructions on garbage collection provided by your local community (either in the form of a yearly calendar sent to you or on their website).   
In any case if in doubt as at your local community office for the best way to do it in your area.

However part of it was obtained from France in a land swap. One condition of the swap was that the airport would have a ""French sector"" allowing flights departing from Geneva to French destinations to be operated as internal flights, with the dedicated access road that connects right after the border.

			Thanks to everyone for the advice. I am now concentrating my search mainly around the Breite and Birs river areas (CH-4052). I really like the thought of living close to the river and the prospect of being able to walk into town along the Rhine is very appealing. Lehenmattstrasse near Birs appears to have lots of suitable accommodation. I'm a bit concerned about not being on a direct tram route although busses stop nearby (and I'm guessing they're far more reliable than their UK conterparts  ). Kannenfeld also looks really nice and would probably be my next (riverless) choice.   
As a side note I've noticed the Breite rheinbad being mentioned elsewhere. Is this a swimming area in the rhine? It looks like a big piece of scaffolding to me  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Dec 2006	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Basel Cantons advice	owls_79	Posts: 104

			Hi, I am one of those people living in the 'awful' blue and green facade apartments! Yeah I know what you mean about the look, but the apartments are lovely. When we arrived in Zurich we had all of one day to find somewhere to live and this seemed a nice enough area (not knowing the city at all).   
In it's defence, I must say that we are very happy here, it seems a relatively peaceful and relaxed place and the 'parks' have day beds, tennis tables, play areas etc to keep everyone occupied, so I'd say it was pretty much a 'hit'!

			In my opinion, the Yamaha DGX series are the best for home performances,as the sounds within them are far superior to the casio range. The Casio's are good entyry level machines, but beware, you will soon tire of the sounds!! Personally, I have used a DGX 500 , and you can even download files from the internet,and play these via the inbuilt disc drive.

			The finished compost is not going to be in the containers you deposit it in. As you likely realise it turns to soil as the worms eat it and it comes out again - or something like that - it's sort of magic anyway. It is doubtless handled by the Kompost police. Your local town hall will know what's what and who's who in local compost...

			You should re-register at the place where your permit has been issued.  You will then get papers which you can take with your now-cancelled permit to the new permit office.  I'm assuming that your permit allows you to change cantons.   
Registering the cars in the new canton is also easy.  Take the car registration form and a cover note from your insurance provider and walk in.  They will give you new plates and you can usually drop the old ones off there too.   
Cost for the new plates varies from canton to canton; I paid 40 francs I believe.   
When your plates arrive back at the old vehicle licence office, you will get a refund on the road tax you've paid.  Naturally, you'll get a bill from the new place too.   
The post office redirect/move service has an option where they notify the sender where possible; this is quite useful.   
Also don't forget to inform: Billag, your electric company (which might know already), insurances, etc.

			ETH Zurich and EPFL Lausanne would both have it, not sure what Chemical Engineering tranfers into for the swiss system though.  Better to search for the proper research group (eg. Polymer Structures) rather than broad subject (Chem Eng) - for example the computational mineral physics group is not in the computer science, earth science or physics department, but material science....Both 'Technical Universities' will have a list of all Institutes on their website, start there.   
Also remember that just because your undergrad is in one field a lot of people change departments for their PhD although they still work in the same field, like when a Chemist BSc deos a PhD in medicine or protein structure (physics department)   
Not sure what of the non-ETH/EPFL domain schools would have a program.   
As is general everywhere with PhD positions, don't approach the university, but find a potential supervisor (you should have a reasonable idea of the type of work you want to do) and contact him/her with your interests and if there is an open position in their group for something similar...

			Hey  
ephedrine is just a vasodilator so it's good for people with allergies and so forth. Of course, some misuse it as it prompts Fight/flight but it is not that hardcore of a substance. Ephedra is herbal and pseudoephedrine is not and I think either can be used as a precursor to some nastier compounds.

Welcome to Lausanne, I have been here 2.5 years now and am very happy to be here.  I don't really know the area around EPFL much, although I work down by the Theatre du Vidy so can't be far away.   
We normally shop in town at one of the migro's or COOP's, try to get veg from the saturday morning market on Rue de Bourg, or if it's a big shop, drive to Crissier to the Leman centre which is big.   
There is a new late opening migros/coop in Ouchy which is ok, but not huge.  Good for emergencies.   
For the best selection of large shops and ""centres commercials"" you really need to go to Crissier, but it's not so easy without a car.   
good luck

			Hi there  . I didn't manage to get there last saturday because the weather was awful. Today however, I took a drive in my car and think that I found the garage you are looking for. It was located about a kilometre from the wooden bridge and has petrol pumps. It was the only one I saw in that area. I only had my mobile phone camera with me and took a few pics for you. Unfortunately, I coudln't stand far enough back (because of an extremely busy road behind me with no pavement) to get the whole premises in but I think you'll recognise it if it's the one.    
Hope this helps.

			Hi jojo,   
I cannot advice on a lawyer, but I am also looking at buying a building with several apartments but around the zurich region and would be interested to have a chat with you about what your doing. We have now purchasing 2 houses with B permits and have had no problems. My Accountant has also explained there are no problems with purchasing further properties and it would possible be better done under a company structure. If you can register a company here you can buy the property.   
How old is the building? Have you checked out the building structure, boilers, cracks, general aging to make sure it's not in need of a lot of money in the short term. I have heard a few bad stories. Also ensuring finance and cash flows are good.   
Also there is little need for a lawyer as the notar looks after the transfers, even with a building.    
Cheers, 
JPH

Feel free to bring too much alcohol back, especially beer - declare it as they're often loathed to do the paperwork for ""small"" amounts.

			Let me provide some real down to earth facts and not the bull you can read on the websites telling you how much you should earn.   
1. When we are talking IT two companies employ a very healthy minority (big double digit percents) of the workforce. 
2. The companies are UBS and CS. 
3. They determine more or less what the market rate is. 
4. Since the end of 1999 they have been reducing the importance of IT functions ie reducing the remuneration. 
5. In order to get over ca 140K you will need to be UBS Direktor/CS VP. 
6. This level is not available to techies unless you have some exceptional and rare skill - but then they are likely to employ you as a freelancer in order not to disturb their internal world order. 
7. Neither UBS or CS has any problem with having a freelancer working for many years.   
So the top and bottom of the above is that the starting salary for a computer person non-management is not going to be above 120K in these banks and therefore it is not likely to be elsewhere either. It is possible to get more from some of the smaller banks or private banks and from industry, just the competition is going to be stiff...   
Project Management, Programme Management and technical management roles can and often do pay more but the days of the highly paid techies are  now restricted to niche markets or niche products  "	null	null	null	Moving from Australia to Switzerland, Cost of living, etc	guest	null

			My way to eat bratwuscht mit bürli is:   
slice (ususally with your fingers) the bürli in two halfs, but not totally, just that the slices still are together in a little part. then put the mustard on the bürli-halfs (usually with help of the sausage). now you can dip your sausage in the mustard on the bürli. After you've eaten the sausage you have wonderful bread with mustard on it.    
best thing of this way: after you have have put the mustard on the bürli, you don't need any plate or table anymore. two hads are enough.   
have fun with eatin it.

			Hi AGA,     1.) Salary ranges for IT jobs like: IT Test Manager/IT Project Manager, IT Consultant in Geneva/Zurich.     Unlike in other countries, it's notoriously hard to get at the salary information - it's not legal (? or at least not done) to publish salaries in the want-ads, but it's allowed to discriminate against you on the base of gender, age, etc. (""Female Software Engineers wanted""... I'm not making this up). I have a set of books at my office which outline salary for various job types in various parts of the country - maybe e-mail me so that I remember to dredge them out.  2.) Where and how to calculate taxes for the various cities. 
Most Cantons have tax informations on their web sites. Here's a link to part of the Zürich site which might get you started. In the German part of Switzerland, maybe google up ""Steuern"" (Taxes). http://www.steueramt.zh.ch/html/steu...euerfuesse.htm      3.) Insurances, what to get and the cost associated with them (family of 3).     An additional note to the last post: Health insurance is mandatory here, but all of the companies are consequently obligated to provide you a base set of health insurance at controlled rates. Beyond that, each company has varied offerings. For family rates (especially for larger families), I've been very happy with CSS. They have discounts past the second child, if I remember correctly.     4.) 3-4 room flats, approx. 100m~2, Prices, general legal terms.     There are several online sites to help you look. Check out http://www.immostreet.ch, http://www.immoscout.ch, http://www.homegate.ch, etc.     5.) Cars, prices for an e.g. VW Golf/BMW (low end).     Similarly: http://www.autoscout.ch, etc.     6.) Any other hard/soft lessons learned which could reduce the risk of relocating.     One little tip: be careful what you write down on any official forms as your religion. If you say you're ""Protestant"" or ""Catholic"", you'll often find yourself liable for church taxes, which you then can't get out from under until you apply to ""leave"" the church. Found out about this one the hard way...     Hope this helps...     D.

			I always go to the place off langstrasse and find it perfect and relatively cheap.  Its called Pusterla ( )   
It is right off Langstrasse, but as I live nearby I would say it certainly not a dangerous area - especially during the day - In fact it's right across the street from a elementary school...so during opening hours you definitely dont have to worry about the area...   
anyways - They have tonnes of stuff in the 'format' you expect from an old-school electronics store - an organized mess, but it's good fun to walk the rows and choose anything (If you want something you dont see (eg ICs) ask at the desk, they are have them in the rows behind the counter and will get them for you...

			Thanks guys. I talked to the pharmacist assistant who said the medicinal alcohol contains camphor to make it unsuitable for ingestion. This would be relevant for my tinctures, as they are not homeopathic but full strength, so you would ingest the camphor which is not good.    
At uni we have clean alcohol but you cannot use that for private use, and I think lay people cannot obtain it by themselves.   
However, in Germany they sell Bacardi 151 which is 75% alchohol, so I figured that would work (although I'd prefer a cleaner alcohol like a wodka). So I will check out Marktkauf   .   
The higher strength tinctures are for Vitex and Silymarin, although I have also been brewing up some bird flu cocktails but they only require regular wodka   "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: May 2006	Groaned at 3 Times in 3 Posts	Looking for bottle shop at Basel-Germany border (with strong stuff)	muze7	Posts: 1,205

			Hey Lynn,      
I just posted a reply to swisscate who asked the same question.   
check out all the links i listed there. (Mods: how do i make a link?)   
400-800 will get you a room in a share-house. the further you're prepared to travel the cheaper this will get.    
If you are a student you should be able to contact your uni/institute. I know ETH has a service providing subsidised places and if you're a post-grad they can (maybe) find you a cheap apartment. I would definitely start with your uni/supervisor/group secretary first.   
also try        
this site was really useful and i'm not even a student (anymore), check out the links on cost of living etc. so you have an idea what you'll be spending.   
good luck   
Nic

			Hi there, I was looking for advice from people with experience of living in Lausanne (sorry if this is in the wrong place....)   
I'm a single guy, and have been living in Zurich for about 18 months now. For a variety of reasons a move to Lausanne might be on the cards, but I don't know anything about the place....   
I speak fluent French so that side of things should be OK, and have a little experience of the Swiss admin ""challenges"" that can come up, having already moved over here a year and a half ago.   
What I'd be really interested in are the pros and cons of life in Lausanne - what are the best / worst things about it, how's the social life, what's the culture like (I was reading some horror stories on another thread about aggressive behaviour for example).   
Has anyone got any experience on this?

			Just wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction for the clothes sizing sytem used here for business trousers and other more formal wear.   
I'm used to waist measuremnts in cm's or sometimes ye olde inches. I would try pants in a size around 86cm or 34 inches. Here, I seem to be a ""50"". From what I have deduced, a 50 is slightly smaller than an 86cm waist, with average length legs. Then a ""100"" is the same trousers with longer legs, and I guess a 25 would have shorter legs. A ""52"" is the next size waist up....   
Anyone know of a guide to this system? Is it a Swiss/Euro etc thing?

			According to my dentist, you have the right to ask for your copies (or to have them sent somewhere). He said that they normally will charge, at most, 10 CHF for copies, but usually it is free. I'm assuming this applies to all medical fields, not just dentists.

			I don't know any acupuncture practitioner in Luzern, but I do know a Basler friend (a Chinese lady) opening an acupuncture clinin in Basel. Why not have a try by starting with a trainee period at a clinic?   
For acupuncture, practical experience is much more important than schooling. In Beijing University of Chinese Medical Science, there are students who can't even get the needles in the right meridian hole after five years of study. So in China, the original nation of Acupuncture, the best practitioners are always senior-age doctors.

			What about region Wädenswil / Richterswil?   
Zürich's about 30 mins away by motorway or train. 
Flat prices are around the price you mentioned. 
Nice location on the Zürisee 
There are plenty English / German play schools / creches around 
For kids Brunni (with special kids ski school) is 25 mins away 
There's even a snow creche at Einsiedeln about 30 mins away 
Adults - Flumserberg & Hoch-Y-Brig are not so extensive - but ok and they are about 30-35 mins away.

Been there, done it, got several t-shirts (and lost lots of cash). Best bet, forget ricardo. They won't raise a finger unless it is against them directly. Visit your city hall and talk directly to the Betreibungsamt. They are the specialists and will have the accurate answers your questions.   
Follow through, don't wait too long. If you are in the right, then they will help you. If you wait too long, then... sorry Charley!    
Remember though, it will cost you.   To file at the city hall that the person lives, you will have to pay anything from CHF 30..- to 105.- depending on that city. Then, once you pay and they other party is presented with the bill (to get your money back), and they don't pay (or can't pay), you will be billed again for the debenture (Schuldschein).   
Basically, if the other party has nothing to pay you back with, then you are out... your loss. Again, got a couple of those Schuldscheine myself. That is why I am much more careful these days.....   
That is also why I have an Collection Agency that also offers Credit Check on businesses and individuals. I have spent a couple hundred on this service, but have saved thousands already. If the credit check shows that this person has payment problems already, then I as for prepayment... no questions asked.    
The same agency is currently working on two non-paying individuals at the moment, one of which in CH. He quit making his payments to me, ignored my attempts to contact him.  Then when the agency contacted him, he struck a deal to pay monthly with the agency... and never made the first payment, ignored the agency's attempt to contact him, now the agency is following through with the Betreibung. Cheaper for me! Poor guy, when they are finished with him, he will wish he had paid me directly   At the moment he is paying alone over CHF 1000.- in late fees, administrative costs and interest... and it's not over yet. tsk, tsk.   
Sorry, got a little sidetracked.  Oh... the war stories I could tell    
Good luck muze7, if you need any assistance, don't hesitate to contact me direct.

			The document that matthewnorth linked to is pretty interesting, I think that I will suggest that a similar thing is produced for PhD students at the university where I work. The most surprising part was when discussing the status of a PhD student with a B-permit on page 60: 
""You have no right to bring your family with you. ... If you have a child during the course of your Ph.D. you might have difficulties getting a residence permit for the baby."" 
Maybe the government should supply these students with condoms!

d) I have seen how many new apartments they are building in Opfikon, and wonder what the future holds for the value of my similar property.   
e) capital gains here is low and I'd rather keep my house in London which is doing very nicely.   
f) I have my own business which is doing very well but the ""salary"" I have   to pay myself is low therefore I can borrow only little.   
g) I am on a yearly contract and would love to stay here long term, but the client renews year on year so I can't commit.   
h) I want to remain in Langstrasse and spend all my money on fast women and booze.   
i) the same as (h) but insert pet obsession (boats, aeroplanes)   
j) ownership is more hassle than its worth (recent experience of haus-dispute here!)   
k) you can't choose you neighbours. Bad neighbours   cost thousands.   
l) I prefer to keep a balanced tax efficient liquid portfolio of diversified risk.   
m) I want to punt all my cash on the Chicago Mercantile.

I can't see the whole text of your permit, so I can't comment on any vagueness that may exist in the definition (though I would say that when it comes to saying what you can't do, these things are often very clear). I can only repeat what I said earlier though - take your permit to your local community office and ask them your question. If any permission has to be granted it will have to start with them, so you'll have to talk to them anyway.

They didnt tell anyone and didnt mention it on the site. Rather sneaky I reckon. Seems to be about 15% increase or so.. So i think we can deduce from that it is no longer free shipping if you are outside of the UK!

It is a full roof house with spinning water wheel, beer drinker and dancing couples. Fully manual (means you wind it every day, a chore). 
It cost about 500euros i think.   
Titisee has full range of cuckoo clocks. Believe it or not, Switzerland is not more famous for cc clocks than Black Forest. Take a drive there and find the clock of your budget.   
300chf will also get you a nice wooden one.

			Yes good point - I always check the ratings, especially when the prices are low. Don't just check the total rating, but click on the store profile and look at the individual rating. Those that score well for low price often score really badly for after sales service or timely delivery. I've sometimes ignored these ratings at my peril!   
And I always fill in feedback afterwards to rate the store.

			the new stadium - good question.  It should have a shopping centre in it and add value to the area so surely the only thing you can say is that rents might go up as demand perhaps increases.

			I could care less about checks. I just need some way to pay student loans, which I must start paying again in December, and my credit card. Whenever I send a giro payment they get it 20 days late or don't get it at all and then I have to go through the hassle of requesting a copy of the check to send my credit card company to prove it was paid. Last time I did that it took 5 monthes to finally get paid! It is ridiculous. If anyone knows of another way without a U.S. bank account or Giro payment then please by all means let me in on the secret.

			My husband is 50 and has the full contributions in the UK, I am 39 and have nothing very much. We were transfered here by our company in October 04. We have one daughter in full time education aged 16 years, my other daughter is 19 but will be leaving for uni in UK shortly so she does not count..........the main reason the company want to get us onto the Swiss system is because its cheaper for them.......also if they do not do this my husband could chose to go back to England and they would then be in serious trouble here as there is no one qualified to do this job apart from him apparently..........(could be his bullshit but its what he tells me)   
At the moment I have no other questions I am just trying to get as much information together as possible so we are better informed when it comes to signing the contract etc........

			Hi there,   
I just joined this page, and am glad to jump right in :-) The weather in Switzerland is something most Swiss (and others) spend quite a bit of time chatting about, and I am about to do the same thing. I guess because as the old cliché represents, it is the one thing everyone has in common.    
In my experience the weather varies a great deal here. It can change temperature by 15 degrees within one day. Especially if there rain in the forecast. I have seen days where it goes from 20 degrees to 5 degrees in a matter of 24 hours. I think the one thing I can say about the weather here is if you like diversity, this is the place for you.    
Because it is such a small country, if you don't like the weather you can usually mange to drive for a couple of hours and find something new. Especially if you cross the Alps. I have been on the south side of the Gotthard (tunnel which separates the German speaking side from the Italian speaking side) where on one side it was clear skies with about 10 degrees and on the other it was snowing like crazy. Also, in the winter, parts of Switzerland ""suffers"" what is called ""hoch Nebel"" or high fog. This is a fog that sits at about 500 meters, give or take, for weeks, making things rather dreary. The good news is that you can escape to the mountains and find the most beautiful sunshine, even in the deepest winter.    
As I said, Switzerland covers the spectrum of weather possibilities. Here you can never be quite sure what will happen in the next couple of days. I guess it is just one of the ""problems"" or ""benefits"" of living so close to one of the most amazing mountain range is the world.   
Hope this helps.   
Cheers,   
Leysin

			well, around 1800 basel was one canton. then they split up. basel-stadt is canton and basel-land too. basel stadt is about 37 km2, so just the city plus riehen and bettingen. basel-land is more countrysite, but the agglomeration of basel too. so in baselland you can live almost in the city or pretty much in the cornfield. depends on the village you coose.  
in my oppinion in baselstadt everything is more expensive than in baselland. the taxes, the rents, the health insurance, shopping and and and. so working in baselstadt and living in baselland can save you loads of money.

			Hi Music Mole   
If your husband is with the Big Bank with the ""B"" in the middle, they USED TO HAVE short-term cheap reasonable acommodation (I can never spell that) especially for contractors, who often only had six month contracts and work permits (in the old days) and no landlord would touch them (as it was too short). I stayed in a place called Eibenstrasse, a mate of mine stayed there up to a few years back, I don't know if it is still going. My agency sorted it all out for me. Rent was CHF600 a month and no bills - but it was a single one-room apartment with a two-ring stove and mini-bar (sorry fridge)   
HTH

If you're in Horgen, you're not far from Sattel (in Schwyz). Check    
I'm no skier (though the Piste runs right past my house...), but it's rarely all too crowed, the runs are of average difficulty and it's not far at all from Horgen. They have a new cable-car from the valley (allegedly the first rotating cable car in the world) and from the end of that line, it's chair-lifts and tow-lines.

			The new Google (Earth Beta) installs locally on your computer and does all that neat stuff the old versions did.  What has impressed me has been some of the tools (path distance mapping, personal points of interest) but also the tie in with Google Earth Community Forums which allows people to place categorized points of interest on the map.  Lots of important things are in there, but the quality is a bit low (duplicate points, errors, etc.) and I suspect a more wikipedia-like approach will help it out...but...   
It is really nifty and may help some of us learn more about our neighborhoods, etc.  And if you have waaaaaaaaaaay too much time on your hands, you can contribute

			Hi Margie,   
Firstly please understand that this is most definitely NOT an IT support forum. There are millions of such forums out there on the net, so if you freely admit that your IT skills are lacking - and you'd like to address that separately, you have plenty of scope to do it - but not here please.   
I've included the wikipedia links to   (which may be a bit complicated for you, but they can make you appear like you are from somewhere else) and   (see applications like Emule in the list of applications).

P.S. Surely something like ""Downloading US programmes from outside the US"" might have been a better subject line than ""Computer Question""?

			Anyone know where to get a nice wooden framed swing for kids in Zurich area. Have tried Toys R Us - pretty useless and a couple of DIY stores (OBI and Coop) - anyone any other suggestions.   
Thanks

			For whatever reason, our UK issued Maestro cards never work at the till at Coop, even though they are supposed to take them. We always get cash at the ATM in the store before we start shopping and pay cash.   
As for Amex, we've used ours successfully at a lot of other shops in Bern, but never a grocery store.

			You can use mobility if you provide a translation of your licence in German, English, Italian or French. Just call them and tell them what country you are from.   
You definitely do not need a swiss licence the first year.   
Oh, if you have a halb tax train card you can hire a reasonably large van from Europcar for 79 a day, which is cheap I think. You get a 20% discount with this card, that is why.   
Lastly, I have seen help advertised for 60 CHF to 120 CHF per hour for two people.

			hello folks,   
So, its been couple of weeks and started looking for apartments thro homegate, comparis etc etc.   
I havent looked much outside of the city yet.. but I kinda got a feeling that theres a big difference in your chances of getting the one you visit.   
For eg., I looked at 2 apartments yesterday.. One near Stauffacheur (gimme a brk on the spelling ), and the other a bit south in zip 8002 in branua.... Wow wat a difference... The first one probably had 50-75 applicants coming in and out in 10 mins I was there.... The second one from wat I heard from the current tenant had only a handful of applicants..   
Ok... ok... I will come to the question... Did you guys feel the same?  If so, what would be a good place which is easy to get but still close to the city and nite life...   
Any help would be greatly appreciated...

			Try comparis.ch, it has homegate and lots of others all in one. Best of all, it has other comparisons, including car and health insurance. Check it out.    
You can also select English as the main language! (Set up a profile, and save email search subscriptions for your area where you want a flat).

			general tip,check out   and type in the name of the place. 
You can zoom out to see how close other cities are, and best of all, click on the train symbols, and fill in where you want to go, and it quickly gives you a schedule and how long it takes. Same for bus and trams (other symbols).   
Also, when looking for flats, type in the address with street number and the detail is such you will likely see the house; great to check out whether it is an awful concrete block or not, and whether there is greenery nearby, transport etc.   
""You can also select restaurants, shops, schools, post, pharmacies, etc. These will be shown by symbols too.

Try the Swiss Diamond Hotel at Vico Morcote; a little away from Lugano but they have a shuttle, it's absolute top-class and has a lakeside pool.   
It's absolutely not a budget place; I had my wedding reception there and some well-travelled guests said that it was the best hotel they've ever been to.

			Hi!   
I agree with Jack about Gemeindeschaftzentrums being the most reasonably priced party room in town. Link given below if you want to explore this option:       
Choose a location first, then click on 'räume miete'. Few things worth mentioning are:   Another option worth exploring (one that a close friend is using for her wedding Apero) is the American Women's Club in Zurich. I think they are well equipped for parties for up to 100 people. They are not that expensive compared to other places where you often get charged per square metre of space rented!! Link given below:       
Click on 'Contact Us' followed by 'Rent the Clubhouse'. You might need someone, who is an existing member, to sign the contract for you as it's a member-only policy.   
Hope this helps. Good luck with the wedding!     
Regards.

			Update on this situation. My girlfriend called the manager of the restaurant. He was supposed to call us, but surprise surprise, he didn't. So she called him and he gave..... wait for it.... you aren't going to believe this...   
an apology   
Yes, you read that correctly. But I'll repeat it again because you might not have believed your eyes:   
an apology   
Anyway, that surprised my girlfriend so much she could really say anything else. His excuse was that the terminal was setup like that, and the staff didn't know how to change it (which begs the question - why not? Have they not been trained, is there no relevant documentation on this operation). His line was that most of their foreign customers were hotel guests and they preferred to be billed in euros. This part I find a bit hard to believe - why would everyone willingly want to be ripped off? But anyway, he did apologise, so I know it's not a big conspiricy by telekurs.
