0	Employment	How to legally employ a cleaning lady	cinzia_t	14657	19	Basel	29.09.2009, 22:50	" 
			
			Just to reiterate on the original post, with   ( only written in German and French at this stage, if you telephone, English is of course available), you will get all the help, information and support you need, to engage an employee, of any kind, for any length of time.    
They are excellent, they truly know thier stuff and are extremely friendly and relaxed with it.  
They take the big stress out of all the beurocratic shite, which is necessary for both sides (even those that don't think they need/want to go that way).   
All sides are protected and for the employer, it makes it so much easier, as they will deal with all the paperwork, apart from the initial contact and details of course.   
The only thing I find a little odd is, they send the end of the taxation year statement, to the employer, not the employee, which is not a big deal in itself and probably has a reason ( I just don't see it yet), you have only to forward it to the employee.   
They truly do a good job.

I'm still working on it, but some functionality is already there..perhaps you'll be lucky and find something.

6	Employment	Findind a job after 50, a real challenge...	Candy-BOS-MA	329	15	Zürich	19.1.2017, 11:43	"    Chortling.  The content of the OKP course happens to mirror much of the training materials that were commonly dished out back in 1983. I know - I still have my old training manuals!  The format for the CV as you've noted in your post is not too bad, but you should know that in the global arena, Switzerland is one of several countries that are notorious for an old fashioned style of CV and if you follow any OKP advice regarding full ""date stamping"" on your CV I suspect you'll be in for an interesting time.....    
My suggestions come from tried and tested career counselling techniques that are absolutely of the current time, and too many years of direct experience.  I happen to be an exec search specialist/headhunter, hiring people in a niche area who are typically 45-65 years of age.  I get to waste a lot of time correcting the CV's and interview techniques of people who've been through courses with the content dished out by the likes of the RAV!     
I think that OKP course is great if you're needing some confidence having been  long term unemployed or are new into the workforce or changing careers radically.  But it's cookie cutter stuff and you'll need to give thought to how you ""stand out from the pack""?  And I can assure you that a CV that clearly gives away your age when you're 50 plus, won't do you favours in those too many instances where ageism is rife and employers have the luxury of choice of many equally qualified candidates.

My wife was unemployed for a few months and didn't have to go on any of the ""touchy feely help you find a job"" courses. Her German is quite advanced so she got the RAV to pay for a ""Rechtsschreiben"" course (proper written German) at the Gewerbeschule - which she never finished as she found a job in-between times.   
Wrt finding new work, in CH a lot depends on knowing people working at places where there are likely to be vacancies (i.e. networking) - so make use of that if you can.

12	Employment	IT senior network administrator salary	kucciolo24	11999	60	Zurich	09.11.2011, 11:49	"    my 2 cents worth: From my experience, there are a lot of ""hidden"" costs in Switzerland which people normally don't calculate with. Pending on your lifestyle your savings could largely differ. You could certainly live comfortably on 5'900pm, and have a life, but don't expect luxury and certainly don't expect to save 2K from it. Of course, you could put away more, but you would need to make some sacrifices.   
90K is OK, but I'd say it's a minimum to get by here.

			As for the job itself see FMF above. But the question is if only Swiss law applies.    
The start of your membership here indicates to me that you may have come over from the US due to this position, which of course means lots of additional stuff needs be done and costs incurred. If that's the case, they happened pre-contract and probably in the US, so US law may apply, which may well give you a better position, dunno.

He's been here for less than 4 months, applies for roughly 4-6 jobs a week (all that comes available). Has had 5 face to face interviews int hat time.  He has a good relationship with recruiters such as Coopers and Stamford which put him forward regularly for jobs with big company's such as Roche, Credit Suisse amongst others.  With all of those interviews, he's received 2nd round callbacks and frustratingly don't give much feedback as to why he missed out.

BUT asking if your spouse is really Swiss is just unacceptable. If it makes you feel any better the employer could still discriminate against you (regardless of nationality) if you are female, have a child, are the 'wrong' colour, age etc etc etc

22	Employment	Seeking employment from the US?	HookTheBrotherUp	1890	48	United States	28.12.2016, 07:38	"    Without getting into too many details, if you search, you will find stories of people who thought that a visit for a few weeks every 6 months would be enough, and found out differently. It is unambiguously against the intent of the Green Card rules, and I'd be suspicious of anybody who claims otherwise. Especially if they are selling something.   
Don't get me wrong, I'm sure plenty of people successfully avoid getting caught by blind luck and/or by being prepared with misleading documents, (e.g. a mortgage on a house you've no intention to return to) but there are no guarantees. So don't fall into the trap of thinking there is no risk, and consider being as circumspect about it as you would be for any other not-100%-legal endeavour.   
Regarding medical, in case it isn't clear, if you are permanent resident of Switzerland you'll be required to have Swiss health insurance. It doesn't sound like you qualify for any of the exceptions that I've heard of. The basic insurance is reasonable in what it covers, but will cost more than 150 per month per person.

First and foremost, a reference has to be truthful, then it has to be benevolent. But it is absolutely allowed to write a bad reference if it is justified and balanced (i.e. for example, individual minor incidents should not be blown out of proportion and result in an overall bad reference)   
Granted, many people abuse this ""rule"" in exactly the above sense, i.e. insist they get a terrific reference even if they were the crappiest employee around. But in theory, that is not what it's about.     
Exit interviews are pointless. Go or don't go, it makes no difference. It's not HR's latest fad, but a few years back, some senior line management thought it was important to know why people were leaving (there was probably a clever study on the subject in HBR). So everybody started doing it, though often only for a certain population and not across the board. In reality, it's either well-known already why someone is leaving and/or no one gives a damn anyway. Don't sign anything.

43	Employment	unemployment office counting 12 months outr of 24?	NoWorries	595	5	Zurich	09.12.2016, 20:45	"    Once you OPEN a rahemnfrist, nothing happens for 24 months. At that point you can re apply going back 24 months. I intentionally did not open a Rahmenfrist as I thought I would probably earn a lot of money over the next 3-4 months & would rather go without 1 months unemployment pay. The effect was my payout doubled.    I had contracts from 4 hours to a couple of days with the odd week. Still managed to get multiple rahmenfrists. The thing is try to never have a month where you earn ZERO   
What you have to do is get ANY job for a month, I really mean ANY job.

			Hi there,   
I'm a UK citizen just completing my masters in applied quantitative methods in the UK and I really want to move to Switzerland.   
The areas my masters takes me to is statistics and research methods in the social sciences (psychology - which I have a degree in -, education - which I also have a masters in -, sociology and other governmental type research - crime data, employment data and so on).   
I am learning French but it's a slow process. Does anyone know how I'd look for, or even if I should bother looking for, jobs in social research.   
Thanks

			No Im a PM/Engineer working in Pharma.  
Normally contracting over here is on a Ltd company basis. You have to  sort your own tax etc.. Client signs your timesheet and you invoice against the hours and an agreed rate. Agency makes money by charging the client at a higher rate than they pay you. A few times I've accidentally been sent the wrong invoice and its usually a 12-15% mark up, 35% seems excessive unless it's a once off fee.

You won't get anything else after that unless you're on a B or C permit I think, in which case currently you qualify for social aid.  But that may change in future.  Parliament are debating a lot of changes for all permits and that's one of them - if you are on social aid a C may be downgraded to a B or even completely annulled.  B might also be annulled if on social aid.  So no permit and no right to live here anymore.   
And unless you're an older person the maximum unemployment days are 400, not 500.

			Hi Guys, I am been doing my research on google and mainly on the english forum about contract rates and i thought i would ask you guys for your advice. I have been offered a contract with a start up company in the printing industry. I would be freelancing and the agency which they are working with sent me a basic contract today. I will be working as a technical consultant in engineering, so process improvement, building up assemblies, going overseas for installations etc. I have been working in engineering now for over 15 years and i spent the last year in italy doing a similar job contracting. I have been living in switzerland for 10 years and i have a c permit. What the agency are offering me based on a 40 hour week for an unlimited time :   
Studenlohn CHF 41.28 
Ferienentschadigung 
Feiertagsentschadigung 
13 monatslohn   
totall AHV-Pflichtiger Bruttolohn Pro Studen CHF 50.00   
I think this is too low and i would like to increase the amount. I would like to ask for a little more and ask for a complete breakdown of deductions from the agency.   
Any advice? thanks in advance

			I agree with you regards salary compensation and the dark-connections that helps to get in. In my case, I also used such option... strong connections... but even that I am not sure if this really may increase my chance to be admitted.     
Despite WB and BIS are international companies, both differs a lot in total workers. BIS hires about 600 pl, so is extremely small. Given that I think 1 month to receive an email or a call to confirm you are in the shortlist is likely.     
The website informs that only shortlisted candidates will be notified. After that an interview is arranged [no matter where you come from.. they pay all expenses] and after that.. 1 month at the most to final answer. In sum... is you don't receive a reply before a month.. cry  .

  as u can see from my title subject myself (from Slovakia) and my fiance (from France) will be moving to Lausanne in March 2017.I have many questions to ask, but let me tell you what is our plan. So my fiance parents live in Switzerland for almost 2 years and have Work Permit B. Our plan is to stay with her parents (French citizens) for the time we will find jobs and obtain work permit. I just looking for some answears to make sure we have everything we need. I know its not a easy to find a job. I have basic french and im still on my course of Level 1 here in London. My questions are can we stay with her parents and looking for a job? if we find a job how long does it take to get work permit, get our apartment, open bank account and etc, How easy is to find a job in hospitality/bars/restaurant will they hire forgein workers and not swiss, i know a couple who came to Geneva and after 3 days find a job and sign contract, is this being lucky? I am not worried about french language i wanna learn for sure. Many thanks for your help   
Many thanks

			And how many of the EF job hunters are even counted in the Swiss jobless rate? I'm not yet have been hunting for over a year.   page today states ""Figures don't include those not entitled to unemployment benefit."" This is news?!   
 This discussion has actually reminded me of a conversation a few months ago. 30ish bloke brought in to “streamline” shops of a certain brand. Proudly saying he fired 5 50+ managers & only rehired one to do the jobs of the others, so he had managed to cut costs for the shops drastically. I was horrified thinking of the poor b*rs who have lost their jobs knowing their chances of finding new jobs will not be good. I tried to say so but was told by the OH to shut up & not start an argument.     
  I imagine there are regional differences though to the rehiring probabilities.

			Hi hopeinajar,   
I have been living here for a little over a year as a trailing spouse and can relate pretty much to everything you just said. In fact that was me last year. No kids. Newly married. Left behind an exciting career, a large group of friends and a busy city life to move here. I tried meetups, immersing myself in hiking, e-volunteering, maintaining a blog, writing for local English publications (for free mind you), just about anything I could to distract myself from getting sucked into those depressing dull days. Unfortunately for me, I could not make any real connections even with all of these activities. I have no idea why people resist friendship here.   
What finally worked for me was finding a job - being employed somehow gave me purpose and to some extent made up for the lack of friends. Incidentally I have an advertising & marcom background as well, and finding such a job here in English was a struggle, as you already are aware. But I did manage to find one in an MNC earlier this year. So there is hope! Today I feel more integrated. I cant say my life here is exciting - it really is not! Nope, no circle of close friends either. But I am hopeful and things are finally looking up.    
What I find surprising though is that there are so many of us in this boat but cant seem to make connections with each other either.

			As you probably know, there are two parts to BVG: savings for old-age pension and insurance against death and invalidity. This is the way the BVG insurance part worked at a former employer:   
1) Life insurance up to the employee's insured salary. 
2) Invalidity/ disability insurance, after two years, up to 80% of the insured salary. 
- For the first two years, a separate short-term disability insurance policy covered up to 80% of the insured salary (this policy was under the KVG law, i.e., not BVG).   
As I recall, the BVG insurances and KVG short-disability insurance at this company did not require a physical examination and no or possibly limited questions about a person's health.   
There was also a management pension/ insurance scheme for salary amounts that exceeded the insured salary under the above BVG plan. Entry into this policy, which had a small number of members, required a physical examination and a health questionnaire.   
That is the way it worked at one company.

			To register as ANOBAG you'll need a Swiss employment contract with your UK employer (vacation time and notice period conforming to Swiss rules, etc). Since they're (still) in EU you'll also have to sign a form ( Agreement in accordance with Article 109 of the Ordinance (EWG) Nr. 574/72  ) where they transfer all their obligations for social security contributions to you (and you agree to it). AHV does not contact the employer as they can only go after you if contributions remain unpaid, not the UK entity.  
You will just  need the annual statement of salary paid from your UK employer to fianalize your AHV bill. 
Apart from AHV you'll need to contract Accident Insurance (offers can vary greatly so shop around). 
You will get screwed in one aspect - with EU-based employer you'll also need to make Pillar2 contributions and finding a plan that will accept a sole person can be a problem and will have higher premiums than a group policy. 
Regarding the taxes, since nothing can be collected at source you just file the ordinary return.   
EDIT: just noticed the ""agreement in which they clearly state that I am not paid any contributions"" part - if that's what you agreed with the employer then you'll pay some 16.5% of the gross for AHV(state pension, disability, unemployment insurance, family allocations fund, etc), plus Accident Insurance (I believe it's called UVG in German) and then whatever Pillar2 you can contract. Some cantons don't audit ANOGAB for accident ins. and pillar2 conformance so you may get away without actually taking any of those but if they do send you a letter then you have 3 months to find something.

			Virginia,    
It would really help us help you if you would clarify your citizenship(s) and current permit status.   
If you are non EU, you either need a sponsored work permit, which you cannot get for the kinds of jobs you are asking about, or you need to be on a dependent permit that allows work. The latter is generally, but not always, marriage based. If you don't have a valid permit, any work you would do would be illegal.   
If on the other hand you are an Irish citizen, you have an easier path as the FMOP gives you the right to work here if you find an appropriate job.   
So again, help us help you by please clarifying your status.

			I can chime in with what MusicChick said, although if you have an EU teaching degree there is some assumption that you will get recognition in Switzerland.   
As for the EDK process. My husband's approval took two years and in the meantime he was allowed to teach. That is with an Australian primary school teaching degree, working as an English speaking primary school teacher in a Swiss-approved bilingual school. He works alongside a German-speaking approved teacher.   
With those subject areas, and not being able to teach in one of the national languages, you really are limited to international 'English' secondary schools or re-developing your career teaching adults.    
The IB (International Baccalaureate) is a system all of its own, and you'd definitely be well-advised to get specialised training to deliver the IB. This would not only serve you better as a teacher in an IB school, it would set you apart from others who lack the specialist IB knowledge or training.

			The maternity leave benefit is separate from RAV/ALV. If you are expecting and currently receiving RAV/ALV unemployment compensation, you would normally be transferred to the Mutterschaftsurlaub benefit for 14 weeks and then return to RAV/ALV, assuming you don't find a job in the meantime. The 14 weeks of maternity leave benefit should not normally count against the 400 work-days (18.4 calendar months) of RAV/ALV. For more information, see this link:       
If your RAV/ALV is higher than the maximum maternity leave benefit of CHF 196 per day, then you should receive 80% of the higher RAV/ALV amount. See p.18 of this brochure:

Hi and thanks for your input!   My first interview here was for the bank position which I was offered. Considering I made it through to the 3rd, 4th and also 'probe tag' rounds for some positions, I am fairly confident in my interview skills. However, I agree with you that job interviews in Switzerland are much more formal than in Australia, and I always prepared for that.     
I agree with some of the commenters here that my age could be an issue but also I've had a few strange reactions from some interviewers when they found out my parents' Slavic heritage. I had one interviewer at a reputable business school in Eastern Switzerland ask me whether I think like an Australian or like a Slav...      
In some interviews, I have also felt like it was a 'quota' interview, and I was just there to fill a number in their hiring protocol list.

They told me to make it for better NETWORKING with senior doctors or consultants etc already working here. It is just to locate/find and make a good rapport with future prospective employers, if any possible.   
It is FULLY your CHOICE (n under COMPUSION). So, they will not penalise you, if you don't want to do so. I didn't made it too.

Yes, it was a shock to learn that I am pregnant and when the doctor said I will have twins I just had to laugh      
I find it quite tricky that the employer can state basically any type of cover for those cases...     
I still didn't announce it in my company as I will have a big ultrasound in a week and want to wait till then, I am almost 14weeks now.  
My doctor told me that I have a high-risk pregnancy (identical twins) and will probably be able to work only until 20weeks..  
As you said, I really feel like I would like to work till the end but my body will probably disagree in few months..

			Polish work permit is useless here. Switzerland is not in the EU and all that counts here is your nationality.   
Best to wait after you get citizenship before even considering a move.      Possibly, but why the rush? If you're eligible for any type of EU citizenship and plan to stay in Europe for an extended period of time, why would you not take that chance? It would allow you to freely move within EU whereas if you move to CH, you'll be waiting a loooong time again before you're eligible for citizenship. You'll face tax issues as an American citizen (Americans will be better qualified to comment on the details here). And it's unlikely you'll find a job within a few weeks or even months anyway unless you're highly specialized and, ideally, are fluent in a local language. Granted I don't know what you do for a living (would be helpful to know), but don't expect this to be as easy as you seem to think right now

			Most if not all of the Chinese tour groups that come here bring their tour guide with them.  I can see the advantage of having someone such as yourself already here, someone who can do research before-hand and who lives in Switzerland so has a better grip of the culture (and who can learn Swiss German!) but the tour groups tend to want people to accompany them throughout their trip.  That means from the airport in China, on the flights, and the entire journey back too.  Plus they pick German or French speaking ones depending on where the tour is.  It'll be a hard market to crack, especially as the Chinese guide will be on a RMB salary and a free holiday whereas you'd want a CHF salary/rate.   
Maybe you could research and create the tours and ""sell"" them to tour companies in China who then run them.  In other words, you explain and sort out train tickets, tickets to get up e.g. Pilatus, arrange meals in restaurants etc but not actually accompany them.   Not sure if there's a market there.  Dunno.   
A Mandarin/Cantonese tutor could be useful but others have tried this here and there just isn't the volume of people to make a living from it.   
Depending on your permit and your cooking skills it could be possible to own and run a food stand at Markthalle.  You'd need to differentiate yourself from the other stalls there, as they've become strict about having too much of the same thing. They're currently swamped with Thai stalls who all got their places before the rules toughened up.  A friend of mine runs the ""Dragon Girl Dumplings"" stall but wow it's hard work and doesn't make much.   
From a quick read of your post, it does look like most of your background won't help you find a job here, which is unfortunate.  Basel's not a hub of manufacturing / production.  However, Syngenta is in the process of being bought out by a Chinese company, so if you can match your background to their business your Mandarin skills may help.

Thank you for taking your time in replying to my questions.   
""Well like any other position a lot depends on what you can bring to the table..."". This phrase hit me.    
When I wrote my CV for a specific job, I would usually put my skills and achievements close to its requirements. However, I usually tend to miss one criterion...for example in the last effort, I lacked the experience or education in banking and finance.    
So far I have only applied to entry-level positions knowing full that I will have start from scratch.    
My idea is to transfer skills into a different industry from the previous and work hard to learn all trades within the new industry. For example, I resolve to secure an entry-level job and then work hard (or harder) to achieve my goals in compliance.    
I have even cast my net to the pharmaceutical industry as they have global security teams.   
I do realise that it is relatively harder to change career in CH. Please correct me if I am wrong.

Depending on the size of the operation, these roles may also be customer or user facing, so the local language plays a role in selection, as opposed to a programmer who works with a team which generally uses English as their language of communication.   
That is not to say that there are no SA roles which require zero German, nor which require exclusively German.

I showed it to my RAV adviser. But because the letter is not written in French/German/Italian, she could not say if its good or bad.    
Now need some expert advice to decode this.   
Reference Letter 
-------------------   
1st part: My personal details (name,dob,nationality etc), Employment start & end dates, Postion at the time of departure   
2nd part: About the company. How great they are and all that BS   
3rd part: List of my roles & responsibilities (20+ bulleted points) - copied from my offer letter   
4th part: Mr John Doe is an SQL professional who worked in a project with one of our largest clients in the banking and financial services industry in Switzerland. He had a pleasant and friendly demeanour and maintained good relationship with superiors, peers and colleagues. His overall performance was satisfactory.   
Mr John Doe leaves our company at his own request. We wish John all the best for his personal and professional future.

------------------------------------     
A Swiss friend of mine told me that the last 2 lines gives an impression that I quit & they didn't mind. If they really wanted me to stay then they could have written that I was an 'asset' to their organization, how sorry they felt that I left their organization..blah blah blah..   
 What do you think? Do you think I should get it rewritten?

			One big advantage is we can all bitch and slag you off when you come complaining that RAV has given you a large penalty for quitting.   
You want to quit, that's fine but don't expect RAV to pay out immediately because you quit.   
As Samaire so correctly said, find another job, then quit, it is far easier to find a job when you have a job than when you don't.   
Alternatively if you have sufficient funds quit and enjoy yourself, but not by using the RAV to who we all contribute too for when it is genuinely needed rather then when you quit without having other means of supporting yourself independently.

In principle I should fit in well into a quant analyst jobs in a bank or hedge fund which are in plenty in Geneva region.    
Anyway I will keep applying and will update you if I have any success. Meanwhile it will be great to know from your experience on how to approach companies/HR while applying for an open position.

No I'm not. I'm not confusing anything. The service charge used to be called 'tips' and then we had the chance of appreciating a good service or not. We no longer have this choice as a 'tip' is now a service charge, and has nothing to do with quality of the service and this cannot be subtracted from the price of a meal should the service be bad. As it sometimes is.      
This is also why many older Swiss people such as myself appear to be miserly when not giving a tip. I do usually round-off in a sensible way but I have not forgoten that this 'service charge' once used to be worked for.      
It was Mövenpick who initiated this sc system because their back room workers complained they weren't getting any of the tips. The idea was that at the end of the day/week/month, the tips would be shared out amongst the working staff as opposed to managing staff - I don't think this happens today - hearsay.

			Hello All..   
It's a big message, but tried to give full picture...    
Spent sometime to read through all forums, nice discussions.. still thought may be my specific case is a bit unique!   
I am a non EU, based near Zurich, on B permit came as dependent with my husband and 2 kids, about 6 yrs ago. My husband is working, as a family everything is fine   
Now, my background is engineering in telecommunications. So yes, feels great... however I am out of touch for a long time now due to family constraints. Hence had been focusing on taking care of family/2 kids. I have no regret about it.   
Now kids are growing up, I am finding sometime now (say 20-25hrs per week) to do some work that could earn CHF.    
 What possibly could be suitable for me:   
1. Preferably work from home or may be visit office 1-2 a week, 
2. Computer based since the work could be done on computer/from home 
3. Since I want to start from clean sheet of paper (from work experience stand point), here are the options I am thinking to get started,    
1. Can I get some ""for free"" work to just get started be it Excel or word or database, any IT/software tools related that I can learn and deliver.  
2. should I try to get some certification ? say on Software Testing tools? or some other certification say for next 3-6 months... and then it becomes easier?  
3. Should I explore in student/university area? 
4. Do online courses? say Software development? Or...? 
5. What all would be good to accomplish in say next 3-6 months, so that I can confidently start applying for real-100% jobs? 
6. What else could be a good start? good path?   
In short , wanted to get your advises to ensure I get on right track... even though I start earning money only after few months,.. but get a good foundation in that direction.    
I believe I am good at social media/understanding new technology application, usage, photography, digital world around creativity/good at taking care of kids, good at English (spoken/written), I have A2 certification in German and French.     
A BIG THANK YOU !   
Regards

			Sounds like they have no clear game plan on the role and that the whole thing is going to be quietly forgotten so nobody loses face for the fiasco.   
Seen it before; new hire is green lit, interviews take place, higher management then get cold feet for whatever reason, but would still in principle want to hire, so the role enters limbo and is put on hold. Candidates are fobbed off and eventually get fed up and stop calling. Higher management, HR and all involved in the process quietly pretend the whole thing never happened and never discuss it again. Whole process is repeated six to twelve months later.

			OP,   
Don't be put off from a career in HR and / or in Switzerland.  Approach your career for the right reasons and in a structured way.    
Others experience will be different and I will never speak dismissively of their choices.    
I'm male and a respected HR professional. Good opportunities continue to exist in Switzerland across generalist roles and specialisms. This despite the doomsday predictions of outsourcing, which is certainly happening to transactional activity.   
HR, like many professions can be phenomenally rewarding.  Look for a role that challenges you, gives you autonomy and mastery in an area you enjoy and you can make a difference.     
Happy Friday.

			Without knowing your background: I work in IT consulting and when we look for sales guys do we get about 5 times the number of applications in Zurich than when we look for technical profiles. 90% of those think they like the idea of wearing a suit and meeting customers for lunch... but don't seem to care too much what the company they'd work for does for a living. So honestly: Landing a first sales job is really different here as everyone thinks he is cut out for it. Even if you have all the talent of the world is it not easy to stick out of the bucket of applications one gets when you do not have any awesome references...     
Most people I have seen getting into it company internally - usually through being either a senior project manager (taking over account manager jobs) or being ""that technical presales guy"" doing all the demos, who after a year or two says ""I could do your job, but you could never do mine""...     
Granted, this answer is rather technology focussed and it might be different, but in principle: Before selling some stuff is it usually good to really really understand what you are selling. So it's hardly ever a job you just land through an application.

Much will depend on how skilled you are and whether the skillset needed is a difficult to fill niche, or not. The IT market is changing, there is a lot of downward pressure on salaries - so be aware that posts of even a few years old might not reflect today's reality.

I've worked with these firms before - both to recruit people and to be recruited.     
They are called headhunters as they look for the right person for the role. This does not mean they are perfect and all-knowing and it can make a difference if you ensure you are on their radar screen. Not just in their database, but also developing a good (mutually beneficial) personal relationship with the search consultants. It's a people business... and more is required than just ""being good"", especially when you are new in a country.

230	Employment	Problems with employer about pay and service car	Metall	575	0	Muttenz	21.07.2016, 20:15	" 
			
			Hello to the Forum, my name is Petro and I'm 40 years old and do live in Muttenz, Basel Land for 2 years.   
My problem: I was working for an employer (small Company) in Basel Land for 12 months until the contract expired end of march this year.   
When I started the Job in February 2015 with my colleagu the son of the boss told me and my colleagu to rent an car in order not to use our own cars for the job. Later (weeks) I went with my colleague (from spain like me) to car rental service and we took the cheapest offer (20CHF per day). We did Call the boss Prior and he has given the OK for renting the car. 
Together with my colleague we took the car from Basel and because of organizatoric reasons i did use the car until end of the job (not my colleague). The end of this job was crazy. In January i wanted to take my Holiday for 2015 and 2016 and my boss told me no. I have to work until end of february without rest. In Februar the goverment made inspection and did find out that we do work more than legal in Switzerland (6 days a week 12 hr per day but our time tracking not realistic). I told the truth to the inspector, my boss didnt like it and told me after the inspection i dont have to come anymore. He did not let me go anymore inside the Company for taking my belongings. He will destroy them he told. Thanx god i did find an job the same day.    
In April i didnt get the pay of march and only after letter from me ( 3 reminder) i got only 800 CHF pay in Junre for the month march because of the reason 4000 CHF was taken because of the car?????. According to the boss me myself and i did use the car only for privat live not related to job. I could not proof that i did use the car for job because the ""book"" with marking where i did drive and when was on my desk in the Company where my boss told me never to come again. How to show evidence if i am not allow to go to my desk again? My college is still working in that Company and told me that the boss did destroy all my belongings.  He is scared to tell the truth in order not to lose his job. 
The Lawyer of my former employer did write to me an letter 2 weeks ago not to come ever back to the Company and contact any employee of them anymore. Furthermore provide evidence for what i did use the car. As far no evidence is given, the 4000 CHF will be not paid.     
 Why do I have to prove what I have done with the car?. In Spain told me a friend who is lawyer in spain the employer must prove why he does not pay your wages?. And then he has to prove that you have just made things so private with the car. How is the situation in Switzerland?

			I think it does depend on where you want to go, I can only really speak for the French speaking cantons, but I don't believe the differences are very significant.   
Ophtalmology is extremely competitive, psychiatry is not competitive at all (but you need extremely good command of the local language, much more so than for many residencies).   
I think if you come from the EU you don't need to take the federal exam. This information  should be on the federal department's website.

What exactly do you do and how much experience do you have? What I have in mind for an accounting manager has largely been offshored from Switzerland by the banks and multinationals that I know. The majority of finance jobs I still see in Switzerland are (questionably) value add on the business partnering/analytics/planning side or inth case of banks jobs that can't be offshored due to banking secrecy/client data

I also believe every certificate a person acquires is never a waste, but at moment I would like to prioritize the ones i need the most.    
I was building different computers based on the budgets, wishes and needs of clients. I would say I would assemble 5-10 PC's per week all of a different caliber. The hardest part of that was to juggle the budget and needs of the client with the best parts I could buy and assemble the machine. It took a lot of research.   
I also worked with companies not only individuals. Some of the bigger projects I remember are planning, budgeting, buying the parts and assembling 50 PC's and planning the network infrastructure before installing everything. This happened several times a year for different companies we worked for. I also did on-site support, everything from printer problems, to security, to network upgrades and maintenance, I personally built a cloud server for company backups etc...   
Basically the company I worked at was providing every possible IT service you can imagine apart from programming software and providing Internet access, and I was at the forefront of it all.   
To be honest, I have no idea what would be the official title of what I was working. I never thought about it before I came to Switzerland.

			My point was if you are working though an own GmbH the company will have to lay you off as an employee if you want to claim from RAV.   
Forming GmbH's is quite expensive so you probably don't want to wind the company up while claiming RAV as you may want to use it if you manage to land another contracting gig.   
RAV may question your directorship of said company even though you are no longer an employee. In which case it is wise to ask your lawyer to help navigate the way.   
In our case, MrsNick and I were co-directors of the GmbH. She also worked at ABigPharmaCompany and got laid off. She claimed at RAV - and they questioned her directorship even though she received no income from the company and admin of the company was an occasional task. We got our lawyer to talk to RAV and convince them that her directorship did not constitute a barrier to finding work. She got her RAV money.

The permit has been approved, and nothing is in the current set of laws that would allow revoking a once-granted permit based on an overall set of (newly introduced) quotas.   
Application for new B permits - this will totally depend on the way the MEI will be converted into law. Right now, it is impossible to tell what will happen.   
Renewal of B permit -  - this will totally depend on the way the MEI will be converted into law. Right now, it is impossible to tell what will happen. Even today,  : ""[permit B] is subject to a time limit and may be extended, provided there are no grounds for revocation in terms of Article 62."" Note the word ""may"" (in the German version, it reads ""kann"", which is equally non-committal)   
Converting into a C permit - this will totally depend on any contractual agreements that Switzerland has made with individual countries; with some countries agreements were signed which give nationals of such country the _right_ to convert from B to C after five years. See, for instance, section 8.1 in the    on this.   
Conclusion: If you want to have the right to be resident in Switzerland, go for Bürgerrecht (citizenship), Niederlassungsbewilligung (permit C), long-term Aufenthaltsbewilligung (permit B), short-term Aufenthaltsbewilligung, in that order.

			My youngest daughter is currently training to be a baker-confectioner and will start her 2nd year of training in August....so shoot me a PM if you need more info, than what I am going to write down here.   
Age is not a problem, my 2 other daughters both trained as chefs and both had a person over 40 in their class at vocational school.   
But the language is a BIG problem!! Because as an apprentice you will have to attend school as well.   
You see, in CH the vocational training, also called dual training, is such that an apprentice works 4 days a week in the trade and visits vocational school once a week for the theory stuff.    
Additionally, per training year, they also have between 2-3 block courses lasting a week, where they focus on a specific topic related to the trade.     
Salary is roughly (before the mandatory deductions)  first year 700CHF, 2nd year 800 and third 1000CHF.....the trade is separated into two specialised directions, one is baker-confectioner, as my daughter trains as, meaning they primarily make bread and larger baked goods as well as  some sweet pastry work and the other is confectioner-confiseur, those specialise more in the way of chocolate and sugar work, pralines and such  delicate stuff. Both basic trainings last three years, with the option of adding the other training module for a further two year.....so that means, if my daughter would want to add the confectioner -confiseur training too, she would have to add two more years of training and voc. school.   
In her case, she will go down the path of a so called BERUFSMATUR, after her voc. training  ends,she'll study part time a further two years and will finish with a federal vocational baccalaureate.    
Also, depending on your employer, some pay your professional clothes/shoes and school material, some don't...it is NOT MANDATORY for a an employer to pay for this. 
We have a special deal with the boss of my girl, if she finishes training with a grade above 5 he'll repay all the costs...he he he...she is on course to finish 5.7 in her first year already.....he may well start to save up.   
Working hours also depend on bakery and boss, my daughter for example starts year 1 at 4am, year 2 at 3 am and year 3 1am, however some of her class mates already start at 1 or 2 am and will do so during the entire three years.   
So you see age is no problem to start an apprenticeship here. If the knowledge your wife has already gained is sufficient, there might be a chance as a beginning to work as ""stagiaire"" in a bakery ( but it is very lowly paid) , there she could also better her language skills  on the job.   
There is also a 2 year vocational training possible, called EBA (Eidgenössisches Berufsattest), this is more basic than the three year training and not as detailed, but also offers the possibility to later on add more training years to become a fully qualified EFZ (Eidgenössisches Fähikeitszeugnis)  baker-confectioner

I sort of recall the RAV telling me that my account would be taken over by them but my Italian is still a work in progress, so I maybe misunderstood.

			Your employer will have nothing to do with your AHV contribution from Einzelfirma.   
Call AHV, tell them your expected income. They will send a bill. At the end of year tell them Actual, they will adjust. Declare all this in your Income Tax return. The AHV bill will also tell you exactly what your total % is, that you can use for setting your rates.   
No more benefits based on ""extra"" contribution. AHV will take into account that you paid AHV for the year and the year will count to your retirement income eligibility.

You should probably do some research. And actually read all the responses thoroughly...   But for those of you in the cheap seats...     
Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) is generally what gap students have so they can teach English to unsuspecting natives in various countries while they save up to go to The Beach.     
A Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults (also, curiously, and without an acronym change, Certificate for English Teaching to Speakers of Other Languages) is CELTA, which used to be TESOL.  It is a little more weighty and is generally used to teach English to adults (some teenagers) in small groups.  A CELTA qualifications is a recognised qualification in language schools/businesses etc but is not the same as a teaching qualification that allows you to teach in schools.  Some international schools may accept CELTA qualified staff if it's supported by relevant experience but that is a whole different argument.       
QTS is also recognised in language schools who generally employ CELTA teachers. I checked.       
Companies will usually go to their nearest language school where they will be able to get contracts for lower prices than an individual could tender.       
How do you expect to tutor ""online""?       
As I've already said - examine your reasons.  If  you're purely motivated by the financial, get thee to a bar job.   Teaching is not the easy option.     
I'm beginning to sound like a broken record but there are enough poorly motivated (and downright poor - as in rubbish) ""teachers"" out there without adding to the ranks.

			Found the article in the archives of l'Express, 26.04.2014:       
DROIT DU TRAVAIL Donner son congé peut réduire son droit aux prestations de lassurance-chômage. Cadre supérieur, Claude en a fait lamère expérience. Claude a été engagé auprès dune assurance et a été inscrit au registre du commerce en qualité de directeur avec signature collective à deux. Plus tard, il a été nommé « Chief Financial Officer» avec signature individuelle.   
Claude, subissant une grande pression au niveau professionnel, a remis sa démission en faisant valoir que sa fonction dirigeante comportait une telle responsabilité quil ne se sentait pas en mesure de remplir sa mission puisquil navait pas bénéficié de lintroduction nécessaire à sa fonction et quil navait pas accès aux informations comptables et financières de la société. Il précise dans sa lettre quil désire se tourner vers de nouveaux défis professionnels.   
Claude sinscrit alors au chômage mais voit ses prestations suspendues.   
En résiliant le contrat, on prend un risque   
Selon la loi sur le chômage, le droit à lindemnité est suspendu lorsquil est établi que lassuré est sans travail par sa propre faute. Il sagit notamment du cas de celui qui, par sa propre faute, a résilié lui-même le contrat de travail Même en cas de désaccord, le travailleur doit avoir fait des efforts pour garder sa place de travail, dit la jurisprudence. [SP] sans avoir préalablement été sûr dobtenir un autre emploi, sauf sil ne pouvait être exigé de lui quil conservât son ancien poste. Selon la jurisprudence, le travailleur doit avoir fait des efforts pour garder sa place de travail, malgré un désaccord, jusquà ce quil ait trouvé un autre emploi, sauf dans les cas où les manquements dun employeur à ses obligations contractuelles atteignent un degré de gravité justifiant une résiliation immédiate.   
La résiliation doit être l«ultima ratio» Claude a résilié lui-même son contrat pour le motif quil se sentait dans limpossibilité dexercer sa fonction et craignait dès lors certains risques, en particulier sur le plan de sa responsabilité pénale et civile. Pourtant, avant la résiliation, il navait pas sérieusement fait part de ses soucis à son employeur.   
Au contraire, Claude est resté à son poste et a accepté ces risques durant plus de six mois, sans se plaindre à son employeur et sans rechercher sérieusement une solution. La résiliation semble dès lors être une réaction excessive qui aurait dû être précédée par la recherche dune solution à linterne.   
Claude aurait préalablement dû prendre toutes les mesures exigibles afin que lemployeur satisfasse désormais pleinement à ses obligations dinformation. Le déficit de renseignements de lemployeur ne constituait dans ce cas pas un juste motif de congé. La démission ne peut pas être considérée comme l«ultima ratio» qui aurait rendu la décision de Claude admissible du point de vue du chômage.   
Claude se retrouve sans travail par sa propre faute. Une suspension du droit à lindemnité de chômage a dès lors été considérée comme justifiée.

But if an employer hires a permanent employee does he typically invest quite a bit more time into him than he'd into you. If I hire a contractor do I expect him to add value from the day he starts... a permanent role might take some months to get somebody briefed and up to speed... because they tend to have a different set of responsibilities.     
To the OP: Simply put... imagine to be a team manager. Would you hire yourself? I accept that people move on between 2-3 years on a job. Occasionally earlier. But repeatedly not even complete a full year? Sorry, not interested.

			HI,  
I think it is important to have a photo in your CV, and of course it depends on what kind of job you are applying for. If it is more formal (e.g you would wear shirt in your job too mainly), most probably one with the suit would be better.  
If you have time, ask a friend to take a photo of you, at home, maybe you can give the relaxed smiley while in the suit  .    
I am applying for jobs now, using a formal pic. Haven't had much answer, until now, when I changed it for a still formally dressed one, but with a nice smile, and added my hobbies to the CV. Conclusion: they appreciate if you show your personality a bit.

Yes, go ASAP to the Steuerverwaltung (Tax-authorities) of your Gemeinde and tell them about your situation; the fact that you won't get a salary for a few months should reduce your tax-payment. They can also give you some advice about the other questions. Another issue is the accident insurance. As long as you work, you are insured, but if you are unemployed (even for a short period) I recommend you contact SUVA ( ). They have some kind of ""bridge"" insurance for people in the same situation. Be prepared to show/send a copy of your admission to university. Good luck!

285	Employment	Employment after PhD studies - experiences	Mr Tom	717	0	Zurich	14.06.2016, 19:59	" 
			
			Dear all,   
Although there are couple of threads which cover similar aspects of this topic, I thought to make a new one where people would give there own (first hand) experience about job search after their PhD graduation, for me the most interesting would be of non-EU people.    
Some of these topics could be found at:           
Besides EF, I was searching internet in general, and found many misleading information as answers to questions asked by students who were preparing to search for a job. Here I want to do the opposite and ask all the members of EF who finished their PhD degree in Switzerland, to share their experience about process of job search, with us who are now in the same situation in which they were not so long ago.   
Further, I am interested in the following. It is stated that in order to obtain a ""fast"" C permit (five years in Switzerland), years spent on PhD studies can be counted only if they are immediately followed by the 2 years on the working B permit.  Now what makes a confusion to me is this word ""immediately"". Namely, after graduation students are entitled to a six months period in which they could search for a job, and during that time they are on the visa (or permit?) for job search.    
There I see basically two intervals interrupted by the job seeking period. My question is, is the student who had finished PhD studies and had searched for a job on the job search visa, and later on worked for two more years on the B permit, available to apply for a ""fast"" C permit?     
Thank you all for your help!

			Hello, 
I am a British qualified primary teacher/ snowsports instructor living in the multilingual community of Nendaz, Switzerland. 
Since having my first child, It has become apparent that there is a lack of early child care; the few maman du Jours are full, therefore I cannot get my son into care, so I can not return to work as an instructor this winter. 
I have a great deal of experience teaching and nannying, with great references and families who always return to me for babysitting help. 
Last winter I was swamped with requests for babysitters from tourists. So I was hoping to nanny again this summer/winter season, but hoped to do it from home, mama du jour style, this way I can work and also take care of my own son.i have experience taking care of up to 3 under 3 year olds at once and looking after large groups of 4+ year olds. I also received an outstanding OFSTED review when teaching a year 4 class in the UK, I thrive form working with kids. 
Currently I have first aid certifications and plan to take out professional third party insurance specific for nannying. I recognize I can only look after  1 0r 2 children as well as my own 11 month old. Can anyone give me any advice on what other documentation I may need to legalize my home babysitting service.  
What would you look for in a child care service like this?    
Thank you in advance.

If you want to have the same rights as married couples - you have to get married. Otherwise the law assumes that as you didn't enter into the voluntary contract of marriage, you don't want the rights and responsibilities that come with it.

Realistically, her best bet is to find either a job in a large multinational (where English is the business language) or a small firm that will hire her for a below market rate - cheap labour. Either way, finding a role will take time.    You've lived in Switzerland all your life, so you probably know the answer to that better than most.   
In the Swiss xenophobic pecking order, non-Yugoslav eastern Europeans are probably considered above those from the former Yugoslavia and anyone non-European, but still way below Western Europeans the 'colonials' (such as Australians and north Americans).

€80k with 30% rule = €61k net per year = €5080/month net in NL.  
CHF130k in Bern = CHF6800/month net in Bern/CH.    
Swiss salaries are a joke IMO. Equating it to 1.5x is also not correct in my opinion. The lifestyle of EUR5k net in Netherlands is way better than CHF6.8k in Bern. 80k in NL on 30% rule is like CHF180k or more in CH, in terms of local purchasing power for accommodation, socialising/restaurants/etc. .     
You would easily afford to buy a high quality well located 4.5 room apartment or house, and have a high disposable income with that in The Hague.    
130k in Bern is around a 45-50k salary in NL. Your 80k offer with 30% rule is a great deal. Confirm with them, that the vakantiegeld 8% extra is on top of it. That means your average net would be averaging EUR5450/month over the year.    
The Bern salary at CHF130k is like a EUR3000-3500/month net income in Netherlands.

			If I may revive an old topic for the topic participants to help, but also any other forum member who could help too.   
My wife recently moved with me in Zurich and is investigating career paths. We are both from a EU country, if that matters to anyone.   
Her most wanted option is to work at a Krippe as she is really talented with children and she can see herself working long term as a Krippe teacher.   
However, she does not have an Early Education degree, but she has a BSc degree in German Language and Literature (aka Germanistik). In her degree they have a lot of classes related to teaching, psychology of students and similar topics. Additionally, she has some experience with Krippes as she has voluntarily worked for a few months at similar settings back home. Additionally, due to her degree she is fully fluent in German and she speaks very good English too.   
Our current stage is trying to identify the steps she would need to take in order to initiate a career in such a profession.   
What we have figured out is that she will need to do some sort of Praktikum at a Krippe that will then lead to some sort of additional education (Lehrstelle).   
Therefore, our current practice is to send applications to Krippes in the canton Zurich with a motivation letter and a CV applying from Praktikum positions. Hopefully then the plan is that she starts the Praktikum and ""Lehrstelle"" which will make her a fully qualified Krippe teacher in a few years time.   
Does this all make sense? Are we having the right strategy?   
It's kinda hard trying to unlock all the little details in an education system that we are not familiar with at all...    
So any information will be greatly appreciated.   
Cheers!

Your skill set would make you employable. Why on earth someone is requesting a PhD for the role you were describing is beyond me. For such a role, hands-on training and sufficient experience often is enough. Unless, of course, this is the most neuro-optimized, hyper-pumped website on the planet. Ever.   
What can you do? As a national of an EU country, you have no issues with entering Switzerland. You may stay 90 days without requiring a permit.   
You will only get a permit to stay, and a permit to work, once you can demonstrate that you have employment which feeds yourself and all your dependents. Claiming to start self-employment, I believe, is not good enough, to get a fresh permit to reside and work in Switzerland.   
Your fastest way into Switzerland is to settle in Germany or France (EU member states), at the border, set up self-employment, go project hunting cross-border, prove yourself, and get hired locally. (You have 90 days without requiring a permit for that, I believe)   
These challenges with/for Switzerland are no different from challenges experienced by non-EU nationals (US nationals) in EU countries. Or EU nationals in the EU. In fact, this applies everywhere, and it is always being attached to a company that gets you moving.

You will pay your taxes in Zurich; except for the taxe d'habitation (or foncière) which you will have to pay in France. So approximately 5% in Zurich.

For the civil service, i'll try to explain: 
In switzerland, civil service is part of the army. So, after the recruitment, one has 3 possibilities: able, unable, and unrecruitable (severely disabled). I had sone cases of sleep walking, that won't prevent me from doing civil service (u don't sleep on your workplace) but it prevents me from doing military service (ypu do sleep in the barracks).

349	Employment	Sacked during notice period?	Dack Rambo	2069	27	Switzerland	04.05.2016, 13:36	"    Simultaneously ""Yes"" and ""Partially No"".   
""Yes"" because the employers obligation to pay stands for five years. Since you were sacked four years ago the obligation stands for one more year. The countdown starts the day your salary would have beeen due, it is stopped (halted) by a) the employer acknowledging his debt or b) by you launching a Betreibung.   
""Partially No"" because you already received unemployment benefits. For simplicity's sake I'm assuming you got paid 60% of your standard salary, so while the employer is obliged to pay for two more months (plus pro rata of your 13th salary [i.e. 1/6 thereof] plus additional benefits if applicable) you would only receive 2x40% with the remainder going to the Arbeitslosenkasse you got paid by as they paid the first 60% to you four years ago already.   
So you would benefit by 2x 40% for the missing two months. With that said it seems unlikely that you are correct because both the employer and the RAV would need to have overlooked that special contract clause, so you should verify that first.   
If however you indeed are correct, as a second step you may want to contact an Arbeitslosenkasse other than the one you were/are insured/paid-out by and enquire what would happen in such a case. Because it may be that you are to pay back the 2x60% you already received and go after your employer yourself, which may or may not be tricky and costly; if however the Arbeitslosenkasse goes directly after the ex-employer (acting in your stead where necessary) then it's all dandy and nice for you. The former variant seems unlikely to me but nonetheless I would want to do this enquiry anonymously so I'd ask a Arbeitslosenkasse other than the one I was insured at (paid by) during the applicable Rahmenfrist. I think every Kantonale Arbeitslosenkasse offer free legal advice and also know proper standards and procedures.

			Peter,    
I think we will have to agree to disagree as your calculations are seriously flawed and you are deluded if you think pension provisions in the UK are as gold plated as you make them out to be.       The housing deposit has just vanished in thin air has it?      What has this got to do with whether 140k is a good salary or not? Would the OP not have to put down 3 months deposit even in the UK? Also assuming that the OP won't have a deposit to roll over from SG. Finally, isn't the relocation assistance meant to cover just this.      Wow! For a person supposedly earning 150-200k, you have left me speechless!      If life is so tough in CH, why did you move here? More importantly, why are you still here?      You will probably still be complaining it ain't enough.   
OP - One final resource for you is the UBS price and earnings study, they also do a handy app which will give you some more insight. I think you have enough information on this thread and enough pointers on where to look.    
PS: Maybe you want to listen to Peter and go ask for a 250k salary.

And:       This.    
 If you're paid at a monthly salary that is and that you are referring to public holidays.     
As for your vacation days: how this is handled in detail (in systems etc.) depends on the company, though it won't matter in the end. You are entitled to 80% of the annual vacation allowance for full-time employees. Let's say your company offers 20 days for full-time employees, you are entitled to 16. To take a week off, you have to take off 4 days, instead of 5 like full-time employees - same result, i.e. one week off for either.     
As for the issue with the working hours, it's probably a programming thing. Some companies operate with a weird calculation in the background, sometimes based on monthly hours. Really depends on the system. I recommend you have a look at the time sheet from April once April is over. If you have worked more than you should and it doesn't show, I'd inquire as to why that is.

this is not an isolated case. The situation in the wine industry in Switzerland is often very hard old styl. We had such conditions in South Tyrol in the 80s. The labor inspectors need informations otherwise nothing will change.   
My advice. Talk with your friend about it. Do write e mail to them and do discribe only in french the situation. They will contact by phone or e mail and ask for additional information. They will send mostly an draft letter to your e mail. You should fill in in french, print it out and sign. Inside this template they will ask your friend if he wants to stay anonymus or not.   
I would advice to stay anonymus otherwise he could be kicked out of the job and should claim from that inspector only change to ALLs problems regarding EHS (evironment Health Safty) and checking the time tables of the Company. So the Need to talk about all over Problems and not his single Problems.   
They will call him again and tell what they will do. In about 2 weeks to 8 weeks they will visit the Company and check the time tables of all employees of the last 6 Months and more and do check the EHS Equipment. Somtimes they do put test samples inside the facilities and ask employees about the situation of the job.    
The inspector or inspectors will leave and will send all employees and employer raport of his visit with orders to change. If employer or employee will not follow the orders and the inspectors find out they will send and reminder. In case this will not help they will issue a high fine. If this not helps than the prosecutor will be informed.

That said, I know of some graduates that did not find a permanent full time job right away after graduaton this school year, but most if not all found at least temporary, part time or non permanent positions close to their choice of location. There is currently a lack of kindergarten and foreign language teachers. The situation in some cantons is more dire than in others, mostly due to some teachers wandering off into adjacent cantons due to pay scales and working conditions.

			We get quite a lot of threads on EF asking if a certain salary is reasonable for a certain post, or how much a person can expect with X qualification for Y job.    
To make all this easier, I suggest making an ultimate salary thread that works like this:   
-we describe a certain qualification, a certain position if possible, and the type of company (without naming them!) and approximate salaries that we know of /have heard of   
I can start with a few:   
-Chemical Engineering graduate (Masters) from one of the two polytechnic schools: you can expect to start at around 80k CHF a year, from what I've been told. Typical employers could be in pharma, chemical products, oil refining or perfumes/aromes. The cantons of Basel and Valais in particular have quite a few employers.   
-Engineering internships (graduate students): One of the polytechnic schools suggests 800.- a month as a reasonable sum, although I have known of people who have earned up to 3k a month.    
-Chemical Engineering PHD, big pharma: I was told at a job fair that salaries started at around 90k CHF a year.

If the employer does not fulfill or breaks any point in the contract. Do check the ""Betriebsreglment"" or a collective labor contract ""GAV"" in case both existing. The payment for labor is the prime duty of the employer!!!! 
In case march payroll is not on account on 4th of April send them a registrated letter with headline ""Mahnung"" and ask them to pay in 5 Banking days otherwise he will be forced to react according to the law. Dont waste time.    
2. A amendment is a termination of the contract from employer side. You have to accept nothing if you do not want and the old contract still will be in force for a period of time (period of notice). 
The problem is after you Register with the  ""RAV"" or rather the ""Arbeitslosenkass"", they will ask the parties why another agreement was not accepted. Only if the new contract was unreasonable within the meaning of the law a 60-Day penalty is very likly to get.          
Dont worry about this non compete agreement. Once he is out of the legal binding contract between employer and employee he is not fixed to this stuff. He can do what he wants to do after leaving the job 
No Money = No duty

Yes you are right, it's about 1 day owing to her in holiday time. Again, whether or not this gets paid out can depend somewhat on the contract especially as your friend was still in her trial period.    
Hypothetically, if the contract stated that she was employed 50% and to work on 3 days then she would be liable for the 5% of time she has in effect not worked. An hourly rate would be calculated, along with the number of hours not worked to find the amount owed.

Hence, it will possibly be unclear or contain some holes. I point this out, because it makes it impossible for me to even make an educated guess as to what the agreement really is between the parties. And so I really can't give any reasonable advice.   
Tell your friend, to read to contract and then try to find an amicable solution with her former employer.

			A certain amount of travel doesn't lead to a higher salary. It's part of the job and that job is paid whatever it's being paid, whether there's travel or not doesn't matter. The only thing that comes on top of the regular salary is travel costs and, if travel by car is required, possibly a company car, that you may or may not be allowed to use for personal purposes too.   
No legislation or regulation, all per company policy.

			I'm guessing that if you're a psychotherapist you have some kind of qualification - probably a psychologist?   
In which case, you might find this thread helpful:       
As a patient, I would say that the important thing to be aware of in Switzerland is that you really need to find some way of having the treatment you offer be covered by basic health insurance.    
It is possible to have psychotherapy in Switzerland, either with a psychiatrist or with a psychologist working under a psychiatrist, and for that treatment to be covered by basic health insurance. It's also fairly easy to find an English-speaking psychotherapist - most teaching psychiatric hospitals have an outpatient clinic, and many of their assistant psychiatrists come from abroad, as Switzerland has a well-thought-of psychiatric training programme... and therefore a fair number of the assistant psychiatrists speak English well enough to deliver therapy in that language.    
This means there is, in my experience, less demand for private psychotherapy - why pay when you can get very good treatment paid for by your health insurance?   
The thread I have linked to gives some good advice on how to get your qualifications recognised, etc.    
Hope that helps!

			To tell you the truth, I see nothing wrong with that e-mail. She seems polite and genuinely irritated by you 'threatening' to bring in a lawyer.   
Of course I do not know her. But from what I read here, the problem is that your normal doctor doesn't return her calls, even though she (the midwife) has the right and authorization to inquire about the details of your sickness. This is a quite normal process for anyone who's absent for more than a few days or weeks, even if it's just a limited absence. She also said that she only mentioned you MAY be able to increase your working hours by 10%, but that the final 'verdict' on this was entirely up to your regular doctor. All she said is that she would like to understand why you are absent so that she and your doctor can agree on what to propose to the Vertrauensarzt.    
I see no attempt here to force anything on you, I'm afraid.    
She is very right in her assessment that you do not trust her. Now again, I of course wasn't there, but it doesn't sound like there is a need to mistrust her and it seems you simply may have jumped to conclusions about a process that, albeit a little unusual in this case, is perfectly legal and normal. As said before, sometimes talking to people instead of assuming helps. This seems to be nothing but a simple misunderstanding.   
I was once sick for several months and reacted quite irritated as well when the insurance/case manager contacted me after a month - I felt pressured at first and like they didn't believe me I was genuinely sick. And then I realized that they actually cared and were not trying to force anything on me, quite the opposite in fact. Ironically, it was my own doctor at the time who urged me to go back soon, and the case manager strongly disagreed. Go figure.    
So here's what I'd do: first, call your doctor. Tell her to call the midwife back soonest possible. Once the midwife and your doctor have spoken, they will probably tell you to go to the Vertrauensarzt (which, again, you are obliged to do). Then take it from there. Stop threatening or even mentioning legal action. There is clearly no need at this point.    
Just to be clear: you want money despite being sick. That is your right to a certain degree and for a certain time anyway. However, it does not come without obligations.

			In the Basel Region (North West Switzerland), I noticed the next game in my economy. For simple Tasks like stock worker etc.., workers are replaced by eastern Europeans. That is why so strange language combinations i do see often ""Polish, German, English and so on by temp agancy"".   
The Earn probably much less than the old staff but still legal. 
But I've known companies that have  financial damage due to poor Quality of work. In one company the complaints increase massively, so that the owner had to react and now do search for the old frontier workers.   
It is also important that from the customer or co worker side you have to look at how much someone works. 
If there is no time clock and someone is at 8 am in the office and 18 o'clock in the evening there driving fork lifts... still works inside the factory then that is a case for the labor inspector. There are laws to be respected. Otherwise we will soon get the Level of EC Countries and the middle class will be damaged further.

			In the US, buyers expect this. It makes a huge difference in middle range houses. I know our agent did little things to our 3 year old house in the US and helped us get almost 25% over the original price just as the market was slowing.    
So the thing here is how do you make buyers come to expect this in Switzerland, and how can you demonstrate the value to whoever hires you (agents, sellers, etc).    
Talking to an agent like E&V might give you some perspective.  Could you team up with someone, like the guy you worked with to sell your own house? Or seek out agents who've had slow sales.  Me, i know nothing about house sales here - i know a little bit about marketing services and this is the tact I'd take. But i also know that the market is weird....still, your own experience suggests you might be on to something.    
Like anything else translated to a new market,  you have to try to create a need for the service...it could work.

			Why don't you wait for it to be issued and worry about it then   There's really no need to panic about something that has not even happened.   
 Given the way the law for this is worded, it's damn near impossible to issue a negative Zeugnis.    
Back in the days when I used to work front HR, we were 'threatened' at times by disgruntled employees that they would 'sue' our company if we didn't issue a nice Zeugnis, even though they should have been glad they got a half-decent one at all, given they were an absolute disaster on both a professional and personal level and/or were even guilty of gross misconduct. So don't worry, even if you had been the worst employee ever, you'd still get a decent Zeugnis    
If you don't like what they give you, you can object and as SpiritV says, this will start some back-and-forth, but see above, you will highly likely get the exact wording you want at some point.   
Better yet: write it yourself. Most people hate writing these Zeugnisse anyway, so they will probably be glad you did it for them   "	506	 May 2010	5	['1', '1']	['457', '182']	5

Since lunch time presumably is peak hour for the restaurant you're unlikely to have the break in the middle of your work time. Often the break will be from 11:00-11:30, meaning the afternoon block is 5h30, which also is just at the maximum length allowed (more than 5h30 would require a 15min break).   
However, if you're essentially on standby during your lunch break (e.g. you get up to get customers' orders) the break has to be included in the work hours, which would result in 9h30 work time, which in turn would mean you're entitled to an additional half hour break.

Well the thing is this. Technically, you need to take your vacation in coordination and agreement with your employer and colleagues. Your employer is therefore always allowed to tell you not to take a vacation at a certain time, for whatever reason that may be. Most just don't do that often. His argument is questionable as your sickness was not a vacation, but when it comes do actually doing something about it, I'm afraid you got the short end of the stick.               
Yes he is correct. As of the second month of sickness, the vacation allowance will be reduced by 1/12 per additional full month of absence.

			Don't know what area you're working in, but according to my experience most larger companies use their 'preferred recruitment agencies'.   
So for example Credit Suisse used Swisslinx as one of theirs 5 years ago (no idea if this has changed).  You need to ask / find out if the agency is the companies preferred partner to be considered to be put on top of the application pile.   
I would still go directly to the companies, according to what's advertised on their web-site as first choice - it's also cheaper for the employer, your CV will get there faster and remain on their database.

			So here's the thing with these so-called ""Änderungskündigungen"" - it's pretty much take it or leave it. However, there are limits and the enforced changes need to be ""reasonable"", whatever that means. How much lower is the salary? Or is it ""just"" the shift work that's changing? I am not sure that a change from ""regular"" working hours to shift counts as ""reasonable change""...     
Also one full day to think about it is not sufficient. Afaik, by law, the minimum time to decide is three weeks, but it may be less (or more). It's definitely more than one day though. It is ridiculous to assume you can decide that in a day.     
Since it all seems dodgy I might as well ask: per when would these changes come into effect?     
I would get legal advice especially on how reasonable the changes are.     
If in doubt, accept the contract, work out a temp solution with the kids and look for another job as soon as you possibly can. But better this way than to not accept it as the others are right, not accepting the contract would probably no longer qualify you for unemployment benefits or at the very least you would have to wait a long time to get them.

436	Employment	Self-employed teaching tricky question	Mariakhen	506	0	Basel	29.02.2016, 14:31	" 
			
			Hello all!   
I've got this interesting issue:    
I am officially registered as self-employed private music teacher here in Switzerland, but I got an offer to give English lessons to a Russian lady ( she especially wants a Russian-speaking teacher, and that's who I am )), but I wonder whether I am legally allowed to give other than music lessons? 
( Just to be noted - I have qualification as a teacher in the both subjects)   
I know I can go to my SVA office and make another registration to add English ( or foreign languages) teaching, but to do that they will require me to show them the evidence of having at least 2-3 students. Otherwise I will need a contract between me and the student ( and she doesn't want to deal with all this paperwork I suppose).    
Any advice?   
Thanks!

			You don't need to be in any certain type of situation to ask for employment at a company, even if they are not advertising for a position.  It is not a sign of desperation - it shows confidence and initiative. Although it may not be the normal Swiss way of doing things, there are some Swiss who will appreciate your effort. It may be a convenient way of taking on a new employee who they have now already met in person, and who they know wants to work there (as opposed to someone who would take any advertised job they could get) - while avoiding the hassle and expense of advertising and interviewing prospective employees.    
That said, have your lebenslauf and cv ready (ask them if you can send a blindbewerbung, and if they say yes, send it off immediately.). You can't just walk up and ask for a job, lol. You need to show that you can still play the game, present yourself formally on paper, etc. But you'll already have your foot in the door, having met face to face.  If they say yes to the Blindbewerbung, your chances are pretty good of getting a job.    
When talking to them, don't dwell on the negative. There is no need to mention your lack of education or experience - instead focus on your good attributes (hard worker, learns quickly, follows directions well, attentive to detail, etc.)     
As mentioned in an earlier post, you could always offer to work for free for a few days as a trial period - and the employer may have nothing to lose by giving you a chance to prove yourself.   
Best of luck to you!

			Hi there,    
I'm an English teacher from Ireland who is on the long path to becoming qualified for the public sector here - feel free to drop me a PM if you want to chat a bit more about my experiences   
I came here through a language assistant programme, which is a great way to start off if you're interested in teaching in Switzerland. Unfortunately the deadline just passed for next year's assistants, but maybe you can fire off an application anyway, or try next year:       
Hope that helps!

			Do you have a CELTA certificate? I found that that was listed as a requirement (they usually want that or the Swiss SVEB qualification) for most of the private language schools that I applied to in Zurich. Language teaching at private schools isn't very well paid, but there are a lot of private schools around. Tutoring is definitely an option, and can also be better paid. And I imagine that having medical English would be a real benefit. If you put up ads around the universities where medicine is taught I'm sure that you'll be able to find some students.

			If it is part of your studies, then you need to let the supervisor from your school know what has happened.   
It is very easy to assume that the inappropriate touching and language of the husband, would be considered sexual harrassment. You did the right thing in clearly communicating that this behaviour was unwanted, and then it did not actually stop, just changed to inappropriate language rather than touching.   
For school purposes, it should be quite easy to argue that the employer was harrassing you, that you asked him to stop, and they then terminated the employment. Then you can start a new placement at a different location.   
Surely they cannot expect you to continue working in a place where you are being harrassed ? Although they terminated the employment, it is very easy to assume that this is not due to your work, but because you showed that you were not willing to tolerate this harrassment...

			It may be usual for restaurants, though I doubt it. But I would want to know much more detail. And most of all, a written pre-signed contract with the standard details.   
What I would also want covered:  
AFAIK waiters typically eat in the restaurant they work, often can be had along with the job. Does that apply here and what's the cost? An honest work contract will list these items (if wanted by your friend) as monthly deductibles to make the payout clear.   
You give no information on the geographical region. If it's in a skiing region this may well be a very shortlived position as their most busy times will be over in no more than a few weeks. Employers will typically let their employees go afterwards, provided the job wasn't limited in duration to begin with.

For a small amount of work online, if I were you (and people will tell me off for suggesting you don't do things 100% by the book) I'd do the work, get the money into your Swiss or Italian account, and say nothing about it! Becoming self-employed in Switzerland is messy, you need permission, and you have to pay other ""deductions"" as well as tax.

You still have to insure them - just like anyone at all that you employ, who already lives here - for accidents at work (Berufsunfallversicherung).  That's easy to do for Fr. 100 per annum, with any insurance company where you might already insure your possessions or your personal liability.

The second had two post-docs and now has a long temporary contract after two BNF-supported contracts. All in the same position. The problem is getting the company to create a permanent position. Since 2007, the financiers would rather let the company rot than invest in people.

Since the school only starts in September would I not necessarily mention it right now... as for the moment you are looking for full time work, aren't you?   
P.S> You can always quit the RAV, but that's probably your last resort. I am pretty sure they will pay you partially if you are available and actively looking for a job, even if it's not a 100% job.

Geneva is pretty small and lots of jobs can be had through networking. Get out and speak to as many people as you can and, with any luck, a friend of a friend might have a lead on a job.

""Your career summary is not as powerful as it should be. As this is a key component intended to compel the hiring manager to keep reading, this section should define you as a professional and ought to contain elements most relevant to your career level and job target. 
From the way the CV is worded, you come across as a ""doer,"" as opposed to an ""achiever."" Too many of your job descriptions are task-based rather than results-based. This means that they tell what you did rather than what you achieved. This is a common mistake for non-professional CV writers. To be effective and create excitement, a strong CV helps the hiring executive envisage you delivering similar achievements at his or her company. Here are some examples of task-based sentences in your CV:""

  Ok, perhaps yes they want to know of any sources of income I am receiving to assess my case. Well not the case for me. I first thought/suspected the question in the form was more for them to know if they should provide me this insurance and deduct premiums for such from my indemnity. I have heard from others that this can be upwards of 200chf per month, seems a lot as I paid a fraction of that (~30chf) in a collective scheme from my old employer. Any ideas on what is the best route forward to avoid excessive premiums?

That was mostly all very informative! Thanks!   It is a bit of a scary time, so imformative is much preferred to talking down on 'my decision' - I think it is healthy to search for something you are passionate about doing, especially when in the social work field    
 The waiting period doesn't bother me, since I decided it was time to move on, I already starting saving my pennies in expectation of this perhaps being the case, better safe than sorry.   
 All my paperwork is ready and sorted, and I don't earn over 3500 per month.   
I am not sure on the process everywhere else (I am aware it differs not only canton to canton, but also between councils), but here the process is done through the RAV who forwards it to the Arbeitlossenkasse for final decision (which is only a few doors down, be there any issues!  ) providing there are no issues with them, everything else (mand. job searching) is done here straight through the RAV. Have people had other experiences?

These things take time to plan and organize for both sides (visa application, placement, housing, health insurance etc) Which semeste were you thinking of going?

			I would agree with your reasoning but my direct knowledge is out of date. 
Academic salaries are still very high for post-docs compared to outside Switzerland. Marketing and management salaries can quickly go higher than the numbers you have quoted but the employment situation in Switzerland has tightened considerably and there is a downward pressure on salaries in general with a lot of competition for the jobs available -many candidates will work for less to get a foot in the door.

Seriously, are you talking about career advise for a big change, enhancing your chances in your current role, or fixing a weak CV?   
For the former I don't really know.   
For the middle one, speak to trusted colleague who know you - they probably understand your strengths / weaknesses better than any stranger. Really look at feedback you've received with an open mind. Another idea is to find someone you want to emulate, not just a role you want to have - it gives a much fuller picture of what is needed.   
For the latter - the agencies can help, but honestly given some of the CVs I see take it with a pinch of salt. Get a few opinions and try to combine ideas that seem good to you - after all, you need to believe in your own pitch!

			Hi all, my gf is working as a dance teachers for 2 schools and she has a permanent contract in all them. She is EU, and all schools contribute to her AHV and pay the corresponding taxes. We are in canton Zurich.   
However, in a 3rd studio where she gives classes, in the contract she is subletting the space. But she does not have her own invoice/advertisement/website, everything is being handled by the studio and she gets a percentage of the gains.   
Is she considered a freelance, a self-employed or an employee for the 3rd school? How should she handle her AHV and taxes for this school?   
She called SVA and they told her that as a self-employed (and that moment she did not know the freelancer status) she needs to pay a minimum of 480 chf up to a profit of 9400 chf.    
But according to prevous posts she does not seem to fullfil all the self-employed requirements.

			Strained relationships (ego clashes?) between PhD students and their advisors do happen. The students stand to lose more in these ""fights"" than their advisors, even when the advisors are well-known for being difficult. If this friend is so close to graduation, he/she should do the best they can to finish and move on; and preferably move away from the sphere of influence of an advisor they didn't get along with. It is even possible that the advisor has absolutely no idea, nor the interest to learn, how to handle the bureaucratic hoops pertaining to the lives of his/her students, in which case the friend must approach the advisor's secretary (or bureau of secretaries) who will provide the answers.   
The friend should think long term, should they want to continue in the academia, on this continent or any other (it is a small world at some point in one's academic research career), because at any step in their career ladder they will need a letter of recommendation from their advisor. Unless, again, it's a well-known and accepted fact that the advisor is completely cuckoo (that even the community isn't in speaking terms with ) then there will be some leniency.    
At the end of the day (the PhD day), there will be hurt feelings stemming from:  
- the time invested in this project - 5 years of their life and their family's life  living like poor students can take a toll on both partners in a marriage; was it really worth it;  
- the dashed high hopes and expectations (hello, maturity!) 
- the perceived or actual misappropriation of intellectual property of research findings;  
- the potential papers that might be written on the particular topic started with their advisor and who gets to be the author on them. (As far as I know both of them must be included, until the topic is done with or they continue in different directions.)   
Soooo, the best course of action is to finish, since the friend is so close to finishing. For a beginner, the best course of action would be to change advisors. Very difficult, but it can be done.   
Good luck!

Your best bet is to estimate it yourself. For that you can use a few links to look at typical  ,   and   - additionally, you should also consider  .

			If you stay long enough at your new place, any bad word about you will eventually be out of date by the time you look for a new job. However, jumping ship on a regular basis is likely to be bad for your career.   
When I was an employee, I was exactly as loyal to my employer as they were to me. Most employers will drop you in a heartbeat if they need to. If they want to ensure you stay then they either need some training clawback, have a longer notice period, or some other inducement (like paying you a decent wage or something to offset a low wage - or inducing feelings of guilt and obligation) to stop you from looking for other work.   
My experience is that as soon as staff start looking around, the employer needs to start planning for a replacement. The trick is to keep the employee just happy enough that they don't look.

Commuting can be a nightmare in Geneva. Best to make sure your workplace is on the same side of the city rather than right across on the other side.  Otherwise it could take you ages and any savings you make from living in France will be eaten up in petrol/public transport costs.

Of course they want to keep the money and earn interest on it, but my attitude is that it's mine. 
So i also need to know the law on this. Are they obliged to pay it when i ask or, can they withhold it?

I did my part-time MSc while I was working at another university, and they were kind enough to give me a day off a week (without pay cut) to pursue my studies. Also note that I'm old enough to have got through higher education when fees were either non-existant (for my BSc) or relatively little (MSc).   
With ""foreign"" degrees sometimes they struggle a bit to work out what the local equivalent is, but in practice it hasn't been an issue for me. With a Swiss degree you'd need to be up to speed in the language of instruction.       Well, yes. It's unclear what the effect will be. My hunch is that in Geneva it will change little, Geneva having been one of the many cantons that voted against the reintroduction of quotas and also being utterly reliant on foreign labour. You also have the issue of being a UK citizen and the UK's status within the EU not being certain, and what that would mean for Brits in Switzerland should push come to shove (presumably something would be negotiated but who knows how long that would take).

The great news is that it seems there is no issue in principle if I do want to move out - so now I can start developing a plan for early 2016. Initially I was concerned that my work situation would have been a roadblock until I had finished my UK contract.   
It would appear that the key open points will mainly relate to Taxes and Permits, so I shall continue my research on these items and post any follow up queries in the relevant sub-forums if required.

Sole proprietorship  
    A sole proprietor company is owned by one  proprietor only. Therefore, labour market regulations for persons apply.  A residence and work permit is always required to work in Switzerland.         
Limited liability company (GmbH) 
    The limited liability company  (GmbH) as a legal entity must be represented by at least one person  resident in Switzerland. This can be the manager or a director.  Accordingly, this person / these persons need to have a valid residence  and work permit in Switzerland.   
The second one is an option very used i think but probably too expensive. 
EU-EFTA that are self-employed (for example a polish plumber) can notify and work up to 90 days without asking for authorization, but i don't think this would apply to a writer since he's not doing any work in switzerland. anyway   "	2	 Nov 2015	0	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

			Hello, 
I'm writing to you guys, hoping that you will have some time to read this, and be able to help me in any way possible.  
I'm from Portugal, on my way to graduate med school. The thing is, I will do my last exam in November 2016, and after that we get to rest for the whole month of December 2016. But I don't want to rest or take some holidays. 
So what I thought was that I could be helpful and learn something along the way by volunteering in some institution in the German side of Swisstzerland. In that way, I would also be practising my German and who knows, maybe some months after go do my residency there!  
So,I am not looking for any job opportunity of any kind.  
I thought nursing homes would probably be a better choice to go!  
By now, I've emailed care homes for the elderly (public-Curaviva; private), refugees centers... Everything, and everyone! 
I only got an answer from Swiss's alzheimer association!  
They were really nice, and tried to help me as much as they could, but there is only so much they can do... 
I would be willing to work every day(I would just ask for some minutes to eat!) for the whole month, and I am not looking for any money or place to stay, I would probably find some where cheap to stay.  
If you have any people at your care, I would be more than willing to help and follow instructions!  
I was just wondering if there is anyone out there, from Switzerland, that would be able to help me in any way, or putting me in touch with the right kind of people!  
So if in the meanwhile you think of something that I would be able to help you guys with, just tell me!  
Looking after someone for the day or something, anything!  
I promise I won't keep bothering you with threads after this one!  
Thanks so much for you time!    
Best and Kind Regards,

			I would avoid focusing on DM skills as that's all pretty much outsourced  and refocus the CV to Digital Marketing aspects. Assess a potential companies weakness in those areas and tailor application to show strengths at addressing those.    
As there are roughly 200-300 applications per role in central Zurich, consider further afield.  Long commutes are fairly normal here and public transport good.   As for Chemicals, DOW chemicals is located in Horgen so check them out.  Also use the time to training while job hunting.. Agile Marketing or Lean Brand or some other industry skills from a good body and also German - Being able to write a short email in good enough German to the HR contact even if the rest of your application docs are in English helps.   
Also the Swiss are very peculiar abut application dossiers, They should include at the very least a cover letter, CV, reference letters from previous employers, copies of all qualifications and certifications, a photo, and scan of permit.

			If you remain on the company's Swiss payroll and continue paying into the ALV (unemployment insurance), you would be covered by it in case of unemployment. If you are transferred to the payroll of the company's new HQ abroad, you would no longer be insured under Swiss ALV but would likely be insured by the unemployment scheme in the employer's new country.   
To the best of my knowledge, there is no possibility to be insured under the  Swiss ALV if you are not on the Swiss payroll of your company.

In the following tax year - in this case 2016/17 - in order to meet the third condition (working abroad) of the Automatic Overseas Test the following need to be met:    
work full-time abroad (35 hours a week, calculated by a special method); 
be in the UK for less than 91 days; and 
spend less than 31 days working in the UK (a working day means working for more than 3 hours in any day)   
...in theory this means it's possible to return to the UK from 5th January 2016  (<91 days) and start working after 23rd February (<31 days) and still be non-resident up to that point. Obviously any UK income after returning would be subject to UK tax as normal but any prior Swiss earnings should be safe.

I would like to initiate this tread for the purpose of gathering information from all sport related employees, parttimers or fulltimers. Please share with others your experience in order to help those who look for such help. Thank you and keep posting to make positive things happened.    
P.E.: My personal issue is following:   
If I am English speaking and German basic, I hold (along with University Master's degree - teaching Sport/Bio, from EU) personal trainer licence from Canada, lifeguard licence of FIN (Italy) - with years of experience. Is there a way of legal work in Switzerland? I am not too happy with general jobsearch websites, I am not gona upload my CV just because someone wants to make profit on hits or so. I would appreciate some very serious infos - links, websites in English where is more than ""CV uploading and then months of waiting"" option. Talking about Eures ... Thanks anyone who will help.  
P.S.: I will do my home work too and I hope I will find something relevant and post it here

Some companies have lists of preferred suppliers, however at least one big pharma company only has one preferred supplier. Which is then basically an outsourcing of employment of temporary workers. 
This makes life much simpler for the pharma company and reduces their costs.   
As NAT says, just get the rate you are happy with and forget about the 'missing millions'.

They also provide a person to answer your questions during labs. In my case this person was located in Germany, but I didn't have a need to contact him.   
So I would advice to clarify with them the process first and then it's up to you to decide if there is any difference if you pay them or if you pay to another remote education center.

			<!!! the legality of this advice would likely be hotly contested by the UK tax dept, so any use you make of it is entirely at your own risk !!!>   
If you can demonstrate that you are not resident in the UK and that you are submitting a tax return elsewhere, then you can avoid paying UK tax completely. 
Firstly, find an off-shore umbrella company. They have a UK company to bill your agency/client but will actually pay you out from a non-UK company. If anyone (eg. agency) wants your address, give your Swiss one. The umbrella company will ask for some confirmation that you're not UK resident and that you intend to manage your own tax affairs. They will then pass the entire billable amount through to you, minus only their commission. 
Have your earnings paid into an off-shore account and keep it secret. Don't keep any records of when you're actually in the UK. 
You're not likely to be working in the UK long enough to get any attention but if you do later get questioned then say that you declared your earnings in Switzerland. You don't have to show what you  declared, just that you filed a return.   
This approach worked well for me for several years and I've never had any comeback.

- complete the CMA since I still have a few month before moving;

- keep the MBA as a last resource in case two designations, my charm, and experience can't get me a job. Or, if I need a career push at one point.

			I get the feeling that you think getting a permit to live/work here will be reasonably easy.  Sorry to disabuse you of that notion, but as a non-EU national you're last in the jobs queue behind the Swiss/EU nationals.  It's not impossible, but it is very difficult.   
And yes, not having a degree could seriously hurt your chances of finding a job here.   
""Cadre, specialists and other qualified employees will be admitted. ""Qualified employee"" means,  as well as several years of professional experience.""   
The criteria for being able to hire a non-EU national is given here:       
and the procedure an employer's application has to go through is here:       
Unless you can stand out from the crowd and offer something no one else can employers simply won't bother to go to the time and expense of trying to get a permit for you.   
The other thing you have to consider is the fact that Americans aren't that welcome in the banking world these days due to the US's FATCA law.  You would need to sign a W-9 form to open any account here to allow the bank to pass said account info on to the IRS.  You still have to do your US tax returns and depending on what you earn you could owe US tax on top of your Swiss ones.  You'd also have to file a FBAR form if the aggregate amount in your account/s comes to more than $10,000 at any time of the year.

			Hey guys,   
I am currently doing my Masters in Finance in Germany and I will be looking for internships in Germany, The UK and Switzerland for next summer.   
In the UK the deadlines for Summer 2016 are basically now, with banks already doing interviews. How is the situation in Switzerland ? Do companies announce positions in advance or jut weeks or maybe 1-2 months at most before the actual start date ?   
I am Bulgarian national (EU-2), speak German (including business German) comfortably at C1-C2. I know that Switzerland has some special treatment for EU-2 (BG & RO) citizens, and there are some limitations (mainly concerning low skilled work-force) but even these will be lifted by May 2016. The maximum period to which Switzerland can extend these limitations ends, I believe, on 31st May 2016.

			Your wife has no automatic right to be able to work here on a dependent's L permit.  That's not to say she can't work, but it does mean she needs to find an employer who's willing to apply for a change in her permit to add the work right to it.  This is what the Foreign Nationals Act has to say:   
""   
On admission, a request by the employer respecting the pay and conditions of employment customary in the locality and in the branch must be made. In addition, members of the family of a short stay permit holder (art. 26OASA) must have professional qualifications (personal qualifications, Art. 23 AuG).   
The possibility of gainful employment for family members is related, according to art. OASA 26 and 27, to the duration of the authorization of the person granted family reunification. If the residence permit of the spouse is not renewed, the members of his family cannot claim a right to pursue their gainful employment (art.6, para. 2, OASA).""   
I don't know her area of expertise, but if there are plenty of Swiss/EU nationals who have it then employers are going to hire them over her because it's easier for them to do so as they don't have to make an application to change a permit.

@Gechoe 
you might like to look up any Swiss Club (or German or Austrian, or even Namibian) Club in South Africa, or approach the German Schools, to see whether the might provide a good place for you and your family members to begin learning German immediately.  If you (and family) have the time, it would probably be worth going along to any free cultural events there.      
I know of a South African family who, before leaving Pretoria, put their children in the German School for a while, so that they were at least fluent in High German before they arrived in Europe.  (Of course, that's also a question of being able to afford the fees.)     
And another who paid for a language tutor to see the whole family together, on one day per weekend, for several months.  Remember, whatever course fees you pay in S.A. will be much less than you'd need to fork out in Switzerland.       
You might just ask around amongst all your friends, and find someone whose Granny is German, and would speak to you.  Afrikaans, if you have any, will stand you in good stead.  And having a head-start, even, say, of the main 10 verbs and 100 nouns, will get you a long way in terms of overcoming the first round of culture shock.     
Another thing:  as you are Swiss, make sure your daughters are properly registered so they each have all their own Swiss documents before you leave S.A.  Much easier than trying to do that once you are here.  And get whatever you can for your wife, too.

			Sorry you are sick and feeling stressed. The law however is clear, the employer is allowed to ask info about the expected duration of the illness and and the intended return date. They are also allowed to ask for a second opinion re the illness (not the nature) and can terminate the contract even during illness, providing they respect the protection duration, which is 30 days in the first year of employment, 90 days from 2nd to 5th year, and 180 days from 6th year.

			Hi, 
I work as a lawyer, some parts of the first friendly answer were pretty good:   
In theory they could sue you for breach of contract; this is unlikely unless you are going to a competitor with sensitive knowledge.   
In practice they could:   
* give you a poor reference (this is one of the few cases where they can get away with it)   
* not pay your last salary (as you've voided the contract).   
Actually, you would have breached the contract, not voided it. Basically you have a contract where, besides other stuff, you agree to do some work and they agree to pay you. Now, when you leave earlier than allowed by the agreed contract, you are not fulfilling the contract, so they could go after you to fulfill it, and also give you a poor reference letter (which is pretty poisonous if you stay in Switzerland). In summary, this is a pretty bad idea. Just turn up and go through the motions of working - that is a much better idea.   
Good luck !

Now that my contract is ending, I am in a huge panic to find work in pharma/science industry.

@Odile - thanks for the additional questions, I should have written this info already. Yes, she's from EU and is now waiting for her B permit (just registered with authorities last week) so will be allowed to work legally for 5 years. She speaks English and German (not super fluent but definitely in a good communicative level - although will take additional courses to improve). She's actually interested in real estate market and also in arranging house interiors (and she good in it, always acting as subject matter expert for other people/friends arranging their houses in our hometown). So not sure about this job market in Switzerland but at least we'll try.

Unless, of course, somebody from the startup just snitches to your current employer. 
But that could never happen, right? 
;-)   
And if you get calls on your mobile from the other job during Swiss work-hours and somebody overhears the contents  or if you let it slip to co-workers at some point and reports you to management, they can just fire you, citing lack of trust etc. 
But that would never happen, right? 
;-)   
Most Swiss companies want you 100% (which is often more than 100% anyway). 
How much time would that consulting-work take, actually?   
Would the US-company be OK with the fact that you're never available in the afternoon? 
Or would they just call you in the middle of the night?

			You certainly don't have to quit. You can look around for new work, if you want to leave, in the meantime, but you still have a valid work contract with termination terms that should be respected by the new people.      I continued working there, the new conditions applied to me, even though I (and a couple of others) had not signed the new contract accepting the new, worse conditions. As I said, whether it was legal I don't know. They had threatened to fire people who didn't sign, but the threat wasn't carried out.  
I didn't become unemployed, but I no longer work there for other reasons.

			I am teaching part time at a primary school and studying at the same time at PHFHNW (Pädagogische Hochschule Nordwestschweiz) at the Solothurn campus in their FLEX program. This may be an option for her since instruction is in German. The Flex program allows you to work a part time job as it includes less in person attendance and more at home study. You attend university 2 days/week. 
There is a shortage of English and French teachers in the German speaking part of Switzerland, and I got lucky to be hired as an English teacher in my first year of University. So it is possible. I did have a lot of experience with children beforehand and I guess my principal liked my resume. Because I work quite a lot (3 days per week) it will take me 7 instead of 6 Semesters to complete my program. The canton of Solothurn issued a ""permission to teach"" in a primary school, which was applied for by my principal when she hired me. I do get paid quite a lot less than a fully qualified teacher unfortunately. (Can't have it all, lol) For this coming school year I received a new contract and am now not only teaching English, but also some other subjects.

The reference said his performance 'gave satisfaction' and the employee wanted to have it changed to 'entire satisfaction' - the Tribunal went against the employee, and said the reference reflected the reality and was in fact comparatively positive in the circumstances. If employers can't give neutral or even negative refs for poor performance- it devalues all good to excellent refs for those who deserve them imho.

			I moved to Zürich in January with my partner. I was hoping to find work here but haven't had much luck  (I am a mechanical engineer). I have just been offered a 4 month contract with my old company in London. I am considering working there and commuting back to Zurich at the weekends. My motives are for boosting my experience and technical skills etc, rather than making lots of money, dodging tax etc.   
I have only had permanent roles in the past. I'm looking for advice on the following:   
- Can anyone recommend an agency in Zurich to do this with? As it is only a short contract and I don't know what I will be doing at the end of it then I don't think it would be worth setting up my own company. I need to set the contract up quickly so I think an agency would be most efficient.    
- I am assuming that because it is only a short duration that I would be working in the UK that I wont need to pay UK tax, is this correct?   
- I'm even sure what hourly rate would be realistic, can anyone point me in the direction of what I should expect?

738	Employment	Kundigungsfrist for Stundelohn [notice period for hourly] contract?	dunjaco	1060	3	Bern	29.07.2015, 09:37	   If I understand you correctly, the shift plan for August was already settled before you resigned.  In it, you have been assigned shifts up until the 9th August only.     From 10th to 22nd August you are not assigned shifts because you are on vacation (already approved long ago).   And from 23rd August to 31st August… are all those days “free”, meaning you have not been allocated any shifts on those days?     If I’ve understood that correctly, then at least in August, your employer is not expecting you to be at work after the 10th.       It is common, when earning an hourly wage (Stundenlohn), that your “holiday pay” is paid to you as a small percentage, together with each hour’s wage.  That usually means that staff on Stundenlohn don’t get paid any separate, additional holiday pay.  This should be specified in your contract.  Typically means that you get your wage (and the small holiday pay supplement) for each hour you work, and you get no money when you are not at work.     If that is the way your contract works, neither you nor your employer will lose any money if you work until the 9th, and then don’t come back to work.  However, yes, please be very careful to speak to your boss.  After all, he or she will already be working on the September plan.  I expect that you and your boss can simply sign a short one-sentence paper agreeing that your last working day is 9th August.  Whatever you arrange, please make sure to get it in writing, signed by both.     And please do write, here, what happened. Thanks.   	20	 May 2012	1	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

			More on Geneva's cantonal dog law can be found summarized by Tier Im Recht, here:       
The TIR site is in German only, but the link to the GE law text is given at the top of the page; that will be in French.   
You mention you have an English Shepherd - how big is he/she? This is important because under the GE law any dog of more than 25kg or 56cm must stand a basic comportment test, once you have passed the test you will need to apply for a permit. An English shep could fall into this category.     
This is Section 3, article 27, 28 of the GE Loi sur les chiens.   
Contact the cantonal veterinary office for details.    
There are other points you should understand, such as where and when leash laws apply, limit to the number of dogs that can be walked at the same time, etc. If you don't speak French (or German, from the TIR site), have someone who does translate the regs for you.     
(I am not in GE so am not familiar with the test nor the permit process - nor with local authorities' interpretation of the law or attitudes towards enforcement.)

My reply was without respect to a particular situation, as you said you didn't see the idea behind the whole thing       Yes I am.  
For example the tax administration Kt Thurgau says so in  , explicitly referring to current Federal Court practice/rulings. The shipment is legally received at the time it's actually delivered if the attempt is successful, otherwiese if picked up at the Post, otherwise seven days after sending. The latter also applies if the recipient has instructed the Post to withhold for longer period, e.g. during holidays, the only exception is a ""postlagernd"" letter/shipment, where a 30-day period is to be used instead if it isn't picked up earlier. To avoid issues with with public holidays, e.g. over christmas, I said ten days.

			Of course India in German is Indien. I just look at Swiss as an anglicised (indified?) spelling of Suisse.    
The reason that there are so many Indian workers in the multinationals is that the CIOs decided (or were told) to outsource to the likes of TCS, Cognizent etc. in the naive belief that this would be cheaper. Bitter experience has taught a few that the cheapest way to outsource is actually to pay the retainer to the service provider, but continue to do the work yourself.   Still, it reduces the headcount, so that's got to be good, hasn't it.   "	3	 Jul 2015	0	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

			The building trade, and especially smaller contractors and subcontractors have a bit of a bad name over this type of thing.   
On the other hand, cost pressure is so huge that companies outsource work to subcontractors at ridiculously low rates without asking how they can possibly do the work for that money. If caught, the main contractor can hold up their hands in innocence and say it was the subconractor that did it.   
Employing people at 10% is a particularly nasty trick as when an inspection happens, everybody has papers and the police need to do a lot of extra work to prove the workers are working more than they say.   
Another area that has a bad name is the food processing industry, especially abattoires and meat cutting. In some cases you get three Africans, apparently sharing the same name and working in shifts around the clock while only one has an actual work permit. They assume the police think all black guys look the same (and a combination of questionable photgraphs and similar looking giuys can reinforce this)

This was what happened in my case.    
Once the Krankentaggeldversicherung however, took over payment of the salary (in the form of sick pay insurance), no further deductions for anything like that were made.  
I was though invoiced about one year later for the entire time under the insurance company monthly payments, by the authorities, for simply pension contributions.    
As I now understand it, having been then off sick for more than 12/18 months, I would have been no longer entitled to unemployment benefit, for the precise reason that during that period no unemployment insurance contributions were paid because they weren't due.

One week ago I received a letter saying that my boss says that I did some mistakes at work voluntarily and a few things more, and they said that they need to check if it was my fault being laid off cause in case it was mine, they could deduct benefit days. Its clear thats not the case, cause my boss clearly fired me. I never refused or quit my job, she fired me.I send a letter to Unia with all the info I thought was convenient to explain : I was being mobbed at job and  my boss ,due to  I didnt quit myself, she finally fired me.  I have done everything with rav, documents, looking for a job during notice period (25 applications in 1 1/2 months). The person I spoke in Rav was great and she understood everything, but seems that Unia wants to f*** me with no reason. Its clear she fired me. so the question is could they deduct days of my benefits cause they think it was my fault losing my job? No proofs .. just my boss word( lying cause she tried to play unfair with me when she fired me but I was ready for that and I obbey her to pay the notice period) against my word. Thanks so much in advance. Im so stressed that I cant sleep cause I need the money to keep my job search. Thanks again.

Cuts could then be weighted - IE cutting the sheet costs money so at a certain point opitisation of the cuts over the wasted material becomes a factor.   
And then finally we threw in altering the shape at runtime into one with random side lengths with a fixed total internal angle and where each angle is greater that a minimum value.

			Your question coveres two contracts. One is your accident insurance, see  Arteemis above. The other is your employment contract, see below.   
Every  employment contract can be terminated effective immediately, but only for due  cause. For instance, the employee beats up his supervisor, or steals  from the employer, etc.   
With that said, employment contracts with  clearly limited duration by default can't be canceled before they  expire. This can be overridden by the contract itself, check what it  says. However, any such clause must give equal right to both parties  (except for a test period, which must not cover more than the first  three months).    
If the employer terminates the contract before it  has run out, and without the contract allowing him to, he owes the full  amount (plus damages, if applicable) he would have had to pay had the  contract run the full time.   
I think you want to contact the   for reliable info, and also advice on how to proceed further. I think your next steps should be to 
1) send a registered letter to your employer saying you regret the termination and are ready to fulfill your contractual duties 
2) call the Arbeitsgericht to force him pay 
but that's just me layman, the people from the Arbeitsamt will know for sure.   
You want to hurry, I'm sure there are time limits involved.

			I would have thought, but am not certain, that Swiss-passport holders get priority, then presumably EU-passport holders with a permit, then non-EU with a permit, then EU yet to get a permit, then non-EU yet to get a permit.    
There is however the complication that in many border regions/cantons, like Geneva, Ticino etc. you have cross-border commuters who receive a G-permit. They remain resident in their countries (France, Italy etc.). They are typically paid somewhat lot less than any worker who is resident in Switzerland, - in theory they have lower living costs. Some employers favour cross-border commuters unfortunately, simply because they cost so much less.    
In theory employers have to give priority to the resident population i.e. persons who are Swiss or foreign but have a valid residence permit already. In practice it is a bit different.

A recognition is not necessary but can help to find a job (Master in country X doesn't allways correspond to Master in country Z in the same field).     .       (eg. Master/PhD): it is the University who will decide if your foreign diploma is equivalent to the required swiss diploma that gives admission to the higher degree (eg. if a foreign Bachelor is equivalent to the Bachelor that gives acces to a Master study programme of that University).  Here a recognition is not necessary unless the University requires it to determine the equivalence.

I've been hunting madly on this forum for all other questions pertaining to starting a GmbH, but I was hoping someone could shed more light on the BVG/Insurances costs. I've heard it's up to 15K per year, but unclear on the breakdown:   
I understand there's included in this pot: Pension (which will be standard for a certain age and certain canton - if anyone has recommendations for firms here, that would be great) and Insurances.    
My question is - which insurances are mandatory and how much (roughly) do they cost per year? (And why does everyone mention December? Do you have to pay the same amount even if the business starts in July?)

So no, she can't just turn up and get a job, sorry.  She'll need to be highly skilled and have several years experience to back it up to stand any chance.    
She might be able to do the Youth Mobility programme that Mullhollander mentions, but may need to find an employer willing to go through that process to get a permit.             
Nor will just any job do, it must be related to her study/training.       
Employment must be in the field of studies. For students, salaries should be comparable to those paid to Swiss students working at universities, colleges or institutions of similar level. An Undergraduate Student may take up a trainee position without pay if he or she is able to indicate proof of sufficient funds (bank statement required).     Employment requirements for young professionals       Employment must be in the field of studies or activity in which the applicant has received training.

If I had not accumulated that vacation time I would have had to continue to search until one month out.  I continue to receive my benefit during this period.

blindly sending applications is good to show the RAV, but you should look for a target (maybe that works with what you did in master thesis or internships) and write ad hoc motivation letters. 
third option, learn german and become an high school physics teacher, not for everyone though, but with german you could at the very least be called as a substitute teacher sometimes? maybe by a private school too.

			Your Bonus % depends on what Function Class that your job role is in. This is at both the companies because I have worked at both of them. (currently working in one of them).   
Both companies have their plus and minus attributes. It depends on your personality.    
People tend to get burnt and really stressed out at Novartis because of workloads. Also there are layers upon on layers of management levels which can cause a lot of red tape and politics specially the middle management levels. Plus the complexities of having so many divisions and therapeutic areas can cause a nightmare for people who are working in cross divisional projects. Novartis is a numbers game, entire departments can get wipped out because of a re-org or a cost savings initiative. So if you are the wrong place at the wrong time, tough luck. If you are ambitious, you thrive under pressure, you are highly perceptive in analyzing risks (and change your course) and are not afraid to take risks you would succeed at Novartis.   
At Roche, it is much more flatter organization but Roche really is two company cultures within one larger organization. You have the anglo saxon attitude like Novartis in the Pharma Division of Roche since the Genentech Merger which has caused a lot of Old IT hands to get very frustrated at the way the division is run right now. It's the shoot first and ask questions later motto now. The same feeling has perpetuated itself outside of IT since the NewJersey HQ was closed down completely last year. So most of the folks in Research and Development are not happy either. All this change will mellow down eventually but currently it's too hot because of the Old guard and the new entrants.   
Then you have have the Diagnostic Division at Roche which is still run like old school Roche. Highly people and alliances driven. You need to know people to get stuff done, you need to have alignment meetings for alignment meetings. If you know your job and you have relationships with the right people you can be a rising star. Also, they still take care of their people and have a lot of human interaction than Pharma. But sometimes, the pace of how slow things move can be annoying.   
Roche and Novartis are two entirely different companies so where you succeed depends on what type of person you are. What is common between them is that they have a really fat margin on most of their product lines and have bags of cash on their balance sheets. So they are not going out of business anytime soon.    
In addition to their innovation, as soon as they see a risk in their pipeline they have the cash to go buy out a promising biotech or medium / small complementary company to beef up their product line.      "	217	 Nov 2011	3	['2', '2']	['160', '62']	2

I should be getting a B permit as I'll be studying for over a year.

Actually my contract does not state I'm a contractor, but an employee of the company multiple times.  Unless there is a different way in which a contractor is determined vs an employee.  But for language purposes, the term employee is used and not contractor.  Would that help in claiming Class 1?      How can the salary insurance be claimed?  I'm assuming a formal petition to a govt entity?

806	Employment	Competetive Salary Package	Somel1	3623	35	Sweden	08.06.2015, 23:24	"    Somel1, you need also to take into account few things:   
1) I assume that you are a female (correct me if I am wrong).  It is very usual that women stay at home here, for the first couple of years until kids go to school.  The attitude towards moms working long hours (especially single moms) is something a progressive Scandinavian woman will have a hard time adjusting to.     
2) You will often get the sarcastic comments from your coworkers (including females) if you need to stay at home to take care of a sick child, get out earlier from work or similar.  And you will get comments or looks in kindergarten when you come to pick up your child late.     
3) salary and career progression is indeed good here.  Also opportunity to travel (for a weekend trip) is way easier than from Sweden.   The costs of kindergarten are astronomical, though, so it offsets it a bit.

			And this is about canceling the contact before starting it     
Under Swiss law, a probationary period of one month - which can be extended to a maximum period of three months - applies in the case of an employment contract that is not limited in duration.      
During the probationary period, a notice period of seven days applies. Thereafter, during the first year of service, a minimum notice period of one month applies, provided that the parties have not agreed to extend this period.     
It is often the case, however, that the employer enters into a probationary period with an employee that is too long and also agrees a notice period that is longer than the minimum required. The question then aris-es as to which notice period applies.     
Recently, the Swiss Federal Tribunal had to decide a case ( ) in which the parties had agreed a probationary period of six months. A notice period of three months as of month-end was stipulated for the time following the expiration of the probationary period.      
The employer terminated the employment relation-ship in the sixth month, subject to the notice period of one week agreed upon for the probationary period. The employee claimed that the three-month notice period should apply. The Federal Tribunal decided that the parties wished to have a notice period apply during six months that was as short as possible and that this period therefore constituted one month.     
The question of whether an employment relationship can be terminated prior to commencement of em-ployment and the question as to the consequences of such a termination are also controversial.     
To this extent, the Swiss Federal Tribunal has not yet decided the latter question. Recently, a Cantonal Court had to decide a case in which an employer terminated an employment contract a few days after having signed it, more than four months prior to the commencement of employment. The Cantonal Court followed the clearly prevailing view and declared that termination prior to the commencement of employ-ment is permissible.     
What is not clear still are the consequences of such a termination. According to one line of thought, the notice period begins to run upon the employee's receipt of the notice of termination. Another view is that the notice period does not begin to run until the contemplated commencement of employment, so that the employment relationship does not terminate until the end of the notice period that applies once the job has been commenced proper.     
The Cantonal Court decided, in our view correctly, that an ordinary termination is also possible prior to commencement of the employment relationship. Therefore, there was neither any commencement of work nor any salary payment.      
The court based this decision on the rationale that the notice period is intended to give the parties time to seek a new position. As long as the notice period is observed this purpose is met. If one were to adopt the alternative viewpoint, this would lead to the dissatisfactory result that an employee would have to take up employment for a short period of time if the parties were unable to agree on a can-cellation agreement.

			Hi guys,   
I recently started doing light part time work for Staff Finder (odd jobs here and there after hours). 
I cannot recommend it enough. 
The pay isn't great (25+CHF per hour) however the people I interact with and the stability and constant cash inflow is great. 
 I mean I have a steady job and all, however the working hours are very relaxed, hence I find myself without much to do for nearly half the month.   
One piece of advice for newcomers. When you are new, take any job you possibly can to get your review up. Once you get a 5 star for your first job, your chances of getting hired skyrocket. I used to get 1 in 20 odds for getting hired before my first review.  
Now I am in the 1 in 4 or 1 in 3 range (and the mail requests went up from 5-10 per week to nearly 10 a day)

2) No, in addition to your master degree (and not sure if statistics would be sufficient) you need an additional year of teacher training.   
3) Yes, if you meet all the criteria, but I believe it is expensive. 
The process for training is as follows: Do your Bachelor and Master in the subject you want to teach  (4-5 years), then add on 60 ECTS points for your teacher training (1 year)    
 It is  a bit shorter if you want to teach at a Sekundarschule (Grades 7- 9)

Would it be possible to ask that person in HR? You could tell him/her that you are very worried about how the unemployment benefit money works, and then ask him/her to give you the names and numbers of the documents/rules/laws which he/she knows explain it.   
Ask him/her to give you a print-out of how your income was put together for every single month or week in which you were completely or partly off work because of being ill.  Ask him/her to show you, or to mark on each month's page, on which part of your income HR based the contributions that they paid into the unemployment fund on your behalf.   
 If, indeed, HR really did pay in more contributions in some months and less in others, then ask for a copy of the rules or the law which sets out that they must do it this way.

			Based on where I work and what you've described it would be above the 150k mark for sure. How much higher would depend on the complexity of the projects you are likely to be managing and how critical they are to the organisation.   
Unlike other countries, it's rare here for companies to quote salary ranges - they expect you to go in to the interview with an expectation ready. Annoying but that's the way they do it.   
My advice is to shoot high - as once you're in the job it's very difficult to get increases.    
Cheers, 
Nick

I informed my RAV advisor that I had been offered a job with a start date two months out. 
She explained that the rule was that you didn't have to look for work during the one month period prior to the start date and, when you add untaken vacation time that I had accumulated, I could essentially stop my search immediately.  If I had not accumulated that vacation time I would have had to continue to search until one month out.  I continue to receive my benefit during this period.

			No, I don't think so... Do you mean one year work experience or short-term work experience?   
It would normally run parallel to the school year and I know where I work we have three-day work experience and two week work experience students any time in the year, whenever they apply. If they then want to apply for a year-long work experience which will lead to an apprenticeship, then they usually start in August and go through to July, and we confirm their apprenticeship with them between January and April. The applications for students to join the apprenticeships go in around April I think.   
However, if we have a vacancy and someone suitable applies, we take them any time of year.    
We never take apprentices who do not already have at least six months or longer work experience...   
I know a lot of students are told to apply direclty for apprenticeships without doing the work experience 'practicum' first, but we found that was unsuccessful for our workplace. The apprentices need a bit of a 'track record' with work first and settle in before they start studying again.    
'School' for apprentices starts same time as the normal school year - around mid August. It may not be too late to apply for this year, but it must be getting close to running out of time to sort it out...

The question is do you absolutely have to live in Bern? What are your main skills? Basel and Zürich will be your best bet, and commuting is definitely manageable if for some reason you must live in Bern, although it is not an attractive choice. Many people do it.

Lack of a work permit isn't really an issue as EU nationals have free movement and it would only require you to have a Swiss employment contract to get a permit.

Citizenship under the current rules requires 12 years, but this is in the process of being changed to 10 years - the new law is due to come into effect late 2016/early 2017 at the moment.  There are also canton and commune residence requirements in addition to the federal ones.  This gives a good summation of current and future requirements:       
I believe that most IT companies are based around either Basel or Zurich - which would mean you eventually needing to speak German for permanent residence (Zurich) or citizenship in these cantons.   
Be careful if considering working for an NGO if permanent residence and/or citizenship is your ultimate goal.  Under current regs time spent with a carte de legitimation or Ci permit count towards naturalisation and this will continue under the new law.  But they will not count towards getting a C permit and as a C permit will be obligatory for citizenship you would not be eligible to apply for this.  Organisations such as the UN and CERN have expressed their concerns about the change, but so far there doesn't seem to be any movement on the C permit requirement for citizenship purposes.  And if you want to change to a non-NGO job any new employer would still have to prove under the non-EU hiring rules that they can't find a Swiss/EU national.  For long term/open ended positions you would probably be issued with a B permit, despite having some/many years with a carte de legitimation/Ci, and would then need 10 more years before being able to apply for a C permit.

A admin to an English (only) speaking manager generally needs local language fluency specifically because the manager doesn't have it. The admin is the person who translates the manager's communications.    
---   
Bear in mind also that many of the MNCs, those whose business language is English, are the same companies whose global reach means that they can move lower level jobs to lower cost countries... where English language skills are also to be had, cheaply. So fewer opportunities for these jobs now compared to even just a few years ago.      When a permit is required.    
Luckily the OP does not need a permit.  But  English-only jobs are becoming fewer and farther between these days. In fact, these days with more and more people wanting to work in Switzerland, many companies ask for local fluency simply as a filter, even if the job doesn't require it.    
One might get lucky - but it would be wise to work on language skills.

do you have your own sleeping room   
Food: 
Are you provided with cooked meals

Back to your question yes I do know people on the money you earn before the deductions for accommodation and food & they manage the best way they can.   
I know people on less money as they do not have a job 100%.  They are reliant to a large degree on help with accommodation through family or friends.

			Sounds like a good ratio of salary in Germany compared to here.  However, when we lived in Germany on a similar salary we had a hard time saving much money compared to (our better salary) here - although I think in comparison, the German salary was lower compared to the Swiss salary than the numbers you mentioned, if that makes sense.  So be careful, taxes do eat up a bunch, although being a single earner with multiple kids helps...Make sure you get a good idea of what the post tax take home will be.  What area of Germany?

Does the lease contract explicitly say minimum duration 6 months (or perhaps, earliest cancel date November)? IIRC default notice period (which can be extended by the contract, so 6 months would most probably be legal) for a single room is something like 2 weeks.   
Even if you signed for 6 months, should you decide to return early, I'd try to negotiate for a shorter term. Explain the situation, try to reduce to perhaps 3 months if you decide to leave soon. The landlord/agency will hate the possibilty of having to collect from an italian that went back, so using that as leverage isn't nice but what can you do - after all, it's just a few days rent so far, this should certainly play in your favor.

			Hello all,    
I am a Finnish physiotherapist/certified massage therapist looking for employment in Switzerland. They say that physios are in short supply and there are lots of jobs to be found. But... there is a problem. I would need to be recognized by the Swiss Red Cross as a physio before I can work as one. One of the conditions is a German language proficiency and that's not going to work just yet. I am studying German but I have a feeling that it will take a very long time to reach a high enough level.    
Living in a German speaking environment would definitely boost my language learning speed. For that reason I have started to look for other opportunities, mainly in massage therapy. Does anyone know more about the subject, for example is there a governing body for massage therapists and do I have to be recognized as one? Is there any chances to find a massage therapy job where I could work with English for starters?

			Hey all,   
My company just announced that it basically has no money left (there are still lots of work contracts to do but no new contracts bringing in enough money), so they will enter administration and we'll have to work 60% but get paid around 90% of our salary [not sure yet as it's not final], anyway it seems we would be paid 60% of our actual salary and the rest would be paid by the chômage    
Has anyone had to go through this before ? As far as I know, we would all have to look for 40% contract jobs too but I do software/web programming so I should be able to find freelance and/or possibly just a bigger 100% contract, however some of my colleagues are in a specific domain and I doubt they'd be able to find a 40% contract [let alone a 100% one] easily.   
Anyway, what should I look out for ? I'm British with a B permit and have an indefinite contract with the company. I've been working with them for about 2 and half years.   
Thanks in advance

			Yes its probably worthwhile updating those figures. Clearly the cost of living in Switzerland has increased in the past few years, and Geneva is far more expensive than Zurich. 
For Geneva it certainly is impossible to live reasonably close to the city and survive on the 3000 CHF. 
I am sorry scipio, while it could be possible many Phd students earn that SNF salary, I sadly found out (after accepting the job) that the other phds in my dept earn 30% more than than amount stated on that website, ie approx 60000 CHF. I am not even sure why they put that salary there... on all the Swiss University websites you will find different salaries stated for Phd students, significantly higher than the SNF! For example:    
 I believe the 47040 is the salary if your prof applied for you to be an snf scholar without an attached project, not if you are hired to work at an already funded project at the University. After that sure, if people accept a lower salary, thats what they will be paid.

			Firstly on the cash flow, if you can't provide proof of sufficient funds to be able to live here while doing your course, you simply won't get permission for a permit and that's the end of the matter.  So if you can't show you have between CHF 21,000 and 31,000 per year (depending on the location of the university and personal demands) when you make your application you can forget it.  What you may or may not be able to earn once you're here doesn't come into the equation.   
Secondly, students are only allowed to work a maximum of 15 hours a week so bear that in mind.  I'm also not sure that private lessons for others would be allowed with a student permit as you'd be self-employed.  Hopefully someon else can clarify that.

891	Employment	Working in PR/communications as a Geneva freelance	CommsGuy	1040	4	London	19.04.2015, 18:01	" 
			
			Welcome to EF! If you're really serious about this, you can make it work.    
Negative points first: 
- Geneva's a really competitive market, as there are already plenty of English-mother-tongue PR/comms people in the region. Many international companies only have a couple of people in-house and farm out specialised work to agencies (often based in London - who then farm out the work to freelances  ). 
- The whole canton, and out into 'La Cote', is mind-numbingly expensive to live in, although this fades to 'astonishingly expensive' if you live in France. 
- PR budgets have really felt the crunch in recent years, and although there's light at the end of the tunnel, truly international cities like London will feel it first.   
Now for the positive: 
- You're a freelance: your greatest strength is probably your ability to sell yourself and your experience. Put this skill into overdrive and exploit every single industry contact you can for leads into the Geneva market. 
- Start off with your specialist areas, and make sure your portfolio is utterly convincing for each job you aim for. 
- Make the most of being in London for networking: many London-based agencies have client companies with interests in CH. Get your foot in those doors! 
- Geneva is only a cheap EasyJet fare away if your enquiry results in a request for a face-to-face meeting.   
As you can see from other threads, it's not cheap or straightforward to establish yourself as a freelance here. Might be best to find a job in-house first - or at least secure a good run of guaranteed work - then branch out once you're a bit more established. Good luck!

			What have you got to lose? Just go and ask for advice- you never know and could be lucky.   
However, as I posted before, they do not have to pay at all if you give up your job voluntarily wihtout having discussed the issues you have with your employer and clearly and given them a chance to make improvements and you shown that you've done your best to find ways to resolve problems. This was well illustrated in a case last year when RAV refused to pay as the guy had given up his job voluntarily and not gone through any of the due process as described above. He took RAV to the Federal Court and lost.

			Based on what you said your experience is in I would say you'll have more luck at an agency. You specialize in areas that are limited. You may also benefit from freelancing as well. You may struggle to find something in a non-agency corporation like a multinational because you need to do more than SEO and email marketing as the discipline of marketing is broad. Are you also on LinkedIn? SEO and online marketing groups could be a good place to start. Also look out for digital marketing events and attend them to network. Check out Advatera:   did a key note at one of their events and on the same day there was a guy talking about SEO. Good luck nevertheless.

			""legal field"" meaning what? Are you a lawyer? If so what kind? What specialty? Are you a paralegal, a legal secretary or something else?   
One month is not a long time in Switzerland to look for work, 4-8 months are more the norm. The employment market is not particularly dynamic here, so patience is key.    
Also, if you're on a support level in your field, you will have a very hard time finding a job without speaking French. It's mostly (very) senior people who can get away with English only. With three years of work experience, you're unlikely to be senior enough to get by without local language skills - so priority 1 should be to learn French. Fast.

same week in Migros [Swiss supermarket chain for those who do not know], aubergines 4.99 per kilo.

			Hi all   
I'm a graphic designer with around a year's experience. Before that I was an account manager for several years.   
I will be relocating to Zurich and marry my boyfriend soon, so visa is not an issue.   
I'm looking to get a graphic design job in Zurich, but my lack of German skills will be an obvious setback. Although, I have noticed that a lot of boutique agencies have websites written in English, and some of their team member profiles indicate that some people who work in those agencies don't speak  
German.   
Does anyone have any insight into creative agencies in Zurich and whether they will consider an English speaking intern or a junior? I'm even prepared to work for free if it means gaining some experience and getting my foot in the door.   
By the way, I'm also a native Chinese speaker, if that helps at all. I know that this is a relatively rare language in the workforce over there.   
Cheers, Gloria

If placed in a temporary position (by  chance or by a headhunter) and if you earn over an amount (somewhere  between two and three thousand Franks), then the employer is required to  pay your social costs.  The only way around this is to be registered as  self employed and send them invoices.  But then you are responsible for  your own social costs.   
There is no option in Switzerland to work, earn money and not pay social costs... let alone claim the income and pay taxes on it.

			Swanny, one of the reasons that flipping properties is not very common in Switzerland is that most cantons impose a punitive tax, a 'Besitzdauerzuschlag' that taxes away most of the profit realized on the sale of properties held for a short term.   
In fact, the penalty is used to specifically discourage flipping/speculative purchase.   
The 'break even' point - that is, the number of years until the penalty decreases until only standard CG applies (itself nothing to sneeze at) varies by canton.    
Something to consider, in case you haven't already run across this issue.

What is really funny, that in each of the case, it was when I was living in my homeland   (central Europe). 
So what kind of value could this info give to the recruiter? no idea. 
I was earning about 19k Euro (that time about 23K CHF) per year, but in totally different economical reality.    
However, when question is just stupid when stated to some abroad-living person, I think it can be even rude when stated to insider. While the only purpose I can figure out is not to give you as much as you would ask for. For example if you change the company and would like to earn 100k instead of 86k, tehy will give you just 94, saying that it is already an increase for you.

			Conditions that need to be met to inform the Gemeinde/Kreisburo/whatever:   
-being a student and going from an internship to ""normal"" employment. Your student permit (even a B) allows work up to 40% so if the new contract is more your current permit is not legal. You present the contract to the Gemeinde and you wait for a new permit tied to the contract instead of the university.   
-being on an L permit tied to the ending contract. If it was a fixed-term contract you will need to renew your permit with a new contract. If your permit was expiring I guess you would just receive an invitation anyway.       
These are from personal experience.   
If you're on a B permit that was issued for your previous contract, from what I understand you don't have to do anything additional and you can just take the new contract to the Gemeinde when they invite you for the next renewal.

			If you are in a favourable position (meaning they are sorry to see you go but life moves on) I would definitely ask for a letter of trcommendation from the Head, perhaps another teacher in your subject or the Head of Dept. Keep a current ""portfolio"" with your cv - perhaps including examples of the type assignments and teaching resources you find effective. Even if you don't need it, having this at-the-ready will save chasing up things when you are hopefully going for interviews.   
Years on from my earlier teaching jobs (first one 30 yrs ago) it is always the sticky point when applying for new positions. Many of the Heads and other staff I have worked with are now retired 30 years later, or moved on to ""other places"" IYKWIM.

I can understand that some Scandinavians get fed up with the social pressure and conformity expectations there. The question is to what extent are they absent or just take another shape in liberal societies like Switzerland. Yea, Swiss are expected to pay for everyhing so it's empowering to decide what you pay for, but you can still only pay for what is on offer. Controling he offer is the key in neoliberal societies, sothat the individual freedom does not contradict the commom interest of the community. And we are right back at square one where we left scandinavian society. The controle is the same, or at least the same level, just not with the same tools. As aforeigner, even a blond one, OP will discover that for himself But it might be wonderful for him to have built up his life in the meantime and find his own place. Even if he ends up at the exact same one in Switzerland as he was in Danmark, it might be considered a huge difference for oneself that one was not given this place but went there on one's own.

To the previous posters who claimed it was illegal to conduct a job search when in Switzerland as a tourist, here is the response I received from the Swiss Federal Office of Migration:   
Dear Sir   
If you come to Switzerland as a tourist there is no restriction which says that you are not allowed to look out for a job at the same time. But, you are not allowed to start working before your employer has applied for a work permit for you and it has been granted to you by the Swiss authorities.   
You can find general information about working in Switzerland under:    
We hope to have been of some help.

So the advice that she would need to return to her country of residency to apply for the visa and the employer has to apply for the work permit is correct.  I was in error in saying she couldn't apply for jobs.

			I think you need to understand a few things:   
a) who you are 
b) who you want to be   
""who"" can translate to individual or employed person alike.   
Reading your postings in this topic, I get the impression that you are a young woman, congrats to your little child, father well, too, I hope, some education in multimedia and programming, only ever earned money in low-level temporary jobs outside of your field of education.   
That is, sorry to say so, a problem - even for a local Swiss person.   
You live in Kanton Luzern, which is predominantly inhabited by German-speaking, traditional Swiss. You do not speak German.   
And that is, sorry again to say so, a problem. Because now you are at a massive disadvantage to that above average local Swiss person who already is in a precarious situation.   
So what do you have to offer that makes you stand out from the Rest of the Pack in a positive fashion? German it will not be. (And neither the atelier, granted)   
Perhaps you could review whether, after your maternity leave, you could return to your previous employer(s)? It would seem that continuing housekeeping at a hotel would be the most logical - although possibly not the most likable - continuation of your career.   
Obviously, the RAV has much better insight into what your unique value propositions are - possibly that's the reason why they seem to not know what could be best for you.   
These are challenging times here in Switzerland - try to focus your energy on making positive progress and be glad that the social system pays you oodles of money while you do.

It's clear what your rights are and no one will be able to tell you any more than you already know. If you want a confirmation, call the local labor court. Most of them offer a first consultation free-of-charge or at a minimal fee, usually during specific hours during the week, by phone or in person.   
He needs to continue to pay your salary as he always has, subject to the same deductions for social insurances and whatnot. It is absolutely not your problem when and how he himself is being reimbursed by the insurance and you are not obliged to wait until he gets things sorted on his end.   
I'd give it another week because of what Island Monkey said.   
After that, you could technically send him a registered letter to request payment within x days (can be very few) and, if he still doesn't pay, you could pursue that further through a lawyer. Given you probably want to continue to work there, I wouldn't go that route just yet, though.

			There is no cover for maternity leave before the child is born. Some employers and employees have an insurance, but many small employers do not, and have to cover the whole cost of finding and paying a replacement out of their own pocket, I'm afraid. Which is why, sadly, tragically even- some small employers will not employ young women- even more so now that the high franc value is putting such pressure on the tourism and other industries.   
As a woman, a mother and grand-mother, I find this tragic- hence my reasons for expecting women to show great responsibility in their own behaviour- lest we become our own worst enemies. Employers maybe aboe to reduce hours (but as said, the long commute is a personal choice and hardly their responsibility) and also discuss changes in the day duties to avoid strenuous physical work, lifting, etc, to as large an extent as possible, of course.   
Many of us have been mothers, have given birth, and have friends and daughters who have done so- and totally understand the issues, I can assure you. Sounds like your job is not physically demanding- make sure you get up from your desk to  move around, do some stretches, etc- and take time to eat properly.

There was a thread here recently of someone trying to find a loophole out of a termination by claiming that their burn-out led to a depression and that these are two different illnesses and the absences unrelated, hence the protection period should start anew. This is obviously not possible - clearly, burnout and depression are very closely related, so no one will say they are unrelated and have to be treated as separate illnesses and hence separate absences.   
In the case here, it's clearly all a consequence of the same accident. It's safe to assume that the protection period has LONG expired, even if OP's wife has not been out of the office for months at the same time, but only a few weeks here and there.

Also, aside from the fact that most companies don't have blacklists anyway, even if they did, no company will blacklist you just because they don't like your face (basically). If anything, you land on a blacklist because you effed up royally on a job, and even then it's unlikely.    
And do you seriously think ""HR people"" from different companies have a circle where they get together regularly to gossip about candidates?   Give them a little more credit.   
Switzerland may be small, but it's not THAT small. People have better things to do than bitch across companies about some candidate - out of likely hundreds every year - they met once or twice. Why would they? They're hardly out to ""get you"", you're simply one of many. If someone doesn't 'like' you in an interview for some reason or other, you're not getting hired - that's all.

I'd say connections, a curriculum enriched with something distinguishing and languages are more important, score is still  important though, try to do better if you can do it with only a bit more of study.

			If I recall there is a certain period whereby you have to start looking for jobs again before the end of the maternity leave period. They should have given you a timeline of what's expected, when you are free, when you have to start looking again etc.   
I'm not sure about travel, but I think during the maternity period you are not under control, so it should be fine.   
After the holidays you receive 5 days holidays every 3 months. You can save them, but you must use a block of 5 days - e.g.  5, 10, 15 days (not including weekends). You cannot just take 1 or 2 days holidays for example.   
Your adviser can propose as they wish, and you have to accept (or be fined). If you plan to go back to work at 100%, then you should be able to (that's their reasoning, and the assumption they're paying you for). However, it seems a harsh thing to do from the outset. Have they a job lined up for you?

Is there anyone on the forum who was made redundant and given a lump sum severance package. Did the unemployment benefits get delayed due to this lump sum payment?   
So for example you were told about redundancy on 1st August, then your notice period ended on 31st October which is the date your employment ended, then the company paid a lump sum of CHF 30000 as a lump sum severance. Does this lump sum delay your entitlement to unemployment benefits from 1st November?   
Please someone who has actually gone through this situation kindly respond.

1030	Employment	Sick leave and change in illness	Sierra01	950	1	Zurich	20.01.2015, 13:55	" 
			
			First and foremost: burnout and depression are so closely related that it is highly unlikely anyone will convince either the insurance or the employer that they are in fact two separate illnesses that have nothing to do with each other.    
There are two aspects when it comes to extended illness: 
- protection period in the sense of protection against dismissal 
- continuation of payment.    
It is correct that the protection period re-starts at zero with every new illness. However, that would require you to have gotten healthy and returend to work before a falling ill again. That is apparently not the case. You have not recovered, never returned to work and as outlined above, these two illnesses are clearly not independent of each other.   
Had you been absent due to burnout for 2 months, then gone back to work for a month, only to then be diagnosed with a herniated disk, things would be different.    
Also, it is none of your employers' business as to what it is exactly that you were diagnosed with and you are in no way obliged to disclose the nature of your illness. All you have to provide is a sick note. That is of course unless you choose to be transparent.   
Note that even if the protection period runs out, you are still entitled to sick pay, though of course not forever either. You are simply not protected against dismissal anymore, unless of course the employer voluntarily agrees to not terminate your contract just yet.

			Same as I always said, the real problem in the UK has nothing to do with immigrants who in the vast majorities are well-paid, educated professionals or low-skilled, hard-working folks who only benefit the system through taxation. (exceptions dont make the rule here as much as the media would like everyone to believe)   
The real issue is the British themselves, specifically the lowest 5% of scum-scroungers and their degenerate generations of offsprings they produce.   
But even all that is nothing compared to what is handed out to pensioners, most of it non-means tested. Benefits are a small part of the budget compared to pensions (especially from public sector employees)   
The whole problem lies with the fact that degenerates = votes, while immigrants are an easy and favourite target for both the low masses and politicians. Thank god the majority of British people are not racist and treat people well, but even a small minority tarnishes the good name.

First of all, figure out the best employee labour markets EU- and worldwide. From what I hear at the moment it is Germany, UK (London that is!) in the EU and the US and Australia worldwide, where architects are in demand. 
Don't waste your time on further qualifications just now. From what I gather from your situation, it would be beneficial if you would first gain some solid on the job experience.  
Finally and most importantly, don't resign! Where ever you decide to go, consider sending out unsolicited application directly to the studios / offices which may interest you - this is a proven route to land a job in our field!   
Remember: When one door closes, another door opens!

			Someone here mentioned that you are Indian.   
I lived near Microsoft's world headquarters (near Seattle, Washington -- in Redmond to be exact) for six years, and I know for a fact that Microsoft employed/employs a LOT of Indians there. And everyone I've ever known to work for Microsoft had usually nothing but good things to say about it as an employer (free childcare, etc.).    
So if you really do have some good qualifications, you might want to consider checking for openings there. The Seattle/Redmond area is a really great place to live (very diverse, and most of the people are very laid-back and open-minded). The only negative thing I can even think of about that area is the weather (not much Sun at all from October through March).

Konuku	1596	11	Outside Lugano	11.01.2015, 15:23	"    13th month is a big con: at best benefiting your company at worst insulting through the insinuation that you can't manage your finances over the year. The worst is when they try to sell this as a ""bonus"" system. Which it definitely is not.   
It also gets messed up if you are taxed at source, as your tax will be calculated month-on-month based on that month's income x 12 and not averaged out over the year. So you get overtaxed in *ahem* bonus months.   
See if you can discuss this with your company's HR team to see if they can just pay you normally over 12 months. Especially as it means you need to wait for the tax authorities to adjust your income after financial year-end before you get any adjustment made in your favour.

			Hi Nick,   
Thanks for you feedback.   
I agree with you on the fact that it doesn't matter if I actually live in France, Switzerland or US. But she made a point on saying that salaris in La Chaux de Fond, Geneva or Neufchatel are not the same as the living cost aren't the same too.   
My point was to know how much should I ask for this manager position (2 to 3 years of experience needed) in marketing in the luxury business in Neufchatel.   
The Michael Page document says that it should be between 80 to 130 000 CHF. I have absolutely no clue as it seems high from her point of view.   
PS: one of the reason I would like to move from Paris is the salary in Switzerland; and I don't want to move there and see that what they offer isn't enough or doesn't allow me to have a better life that I actually have.

Your boss would be able to learn a bit about you in the context of your culture, which would also help him/her be a better manager to you. It also makes it much more likely that the next 'problem' gets treated as a cultural idiosyncrasy, rather than a real problem, the next time either one of you doesn't react to something in the way that the other thinks you should.   
On that note, and based on the information that your boss is German, I'd concur with the others that it is likely that he meant well. Germany was my first country/culture as an expat and I remember several occasions, where I started to feel a bit put out and I had to mentally remind myself that I wasn't in Kansas anymore.   Their language and their culture is very direct; Germans say what they mean and often struggle in English with 'small talk', sarcasm, or the fact that the meaning in a conversation is often implied rather than explicitly stated.    
I remember at least one awkward early conversation during my time there that felt like an interrogation into my personal life. Not wanting to submit to such questioning, but not wanting to be rude, I gave mono-syllabic non-committal answers to most of my boss's questions. Wanting this torture to stop, at some point I finally just enquired, why he was asking. It turns out he was just curious about me and where I had come from; years later, we are still good friends (though he's no longer my boss).    
Because of this conversation, I decided that I was going to consciously engage in small talk with everybody in the office, regardless of the language. It was awkward as hell, but eventually it just became one of my weird foreigner quirks. And they really had improved a lot at it by the time I left....  "	33	 Jun 2013	2	['3', '2']	['3', '3']	0

The new employer would have paid for an international move, but not a move within Switzerland. And he's fairly educated and specialized, but of course not a CEO.

The only difference I can see is whether you work with Swiss or Americans. Or other nationalities for that matter. But whether this takes place in a Swiss or US company doesn't matter the slightest. And just because you work for a Swiss company doesn't mean you work with Swiss, and if you work in a US company doesn't mean that all employees are American.

The thing is as 3Wishes said many international students are doing courses that are taught in English so don't have the language skills.  Also for a non-EU the job needs to meet certain criteria.   
""Those who are successful in securing employment will be issued a work permit, provided the prospective position involves an activity of particular   importance.""       
You say it doesn't happen the same way in the US, but remember they're not restricted by agreements with other countries in the way Switzerland is with the EU.  Companies there can sponsor people from all over the world which isn't possible here because of the Free Movement Agreement.

For employment disputes up to an amount in dispute of CHF 30'000 no court costs are levied ( ) before the conciliation authority. and likewise there is no compensation for lawyer's costs awarded.

			k_and_e is right.   
Generally, a termination letter send by registered mail counts as delivered as of the first day you could have picked it up. So for instance, if it was sent last Wednesday and you received a note from the post office on Friday (i.e. still November), the termination is valid by the end of November. It is even valid when you refuse to accept it at all/do not pick it up at all.   
HOWEVER: if you are absent for whatever reason, indeed unable to pick up registered mail and your employer knows about it, the above does not apply. Note that this does not make the termination void, but simply delays it by a month.

			Yes there are legal consequences.   
They are unlikely to 'sue the hell out of you'. But it is  correct that an employer may ask for up to 25% of the first monthly salary as a compensation for damages he might have due to you not keeping your end of the bargain.    
You are allowed to terminate a contract before actually starting to work, but the notice period will start with the first contractual working day. As most contracts have a probation period within which either party can terminate within 7 days (double-check if that's true in your case), you can be out within the week. You can go this route, send a written termination letter and hope that the employer won't force you to work this one week (or however long it is) and just let it go without asking for financial compensation. Always good to try it the nice way, so call them, explain, clarify and hope for the best.

it's been 2 months i'm strugglling with the registration to the Unemployment benefit or the ALK (Arbeitslosenkasse).  Here is my situation :
i've worked previously in France
i came in Switzerland and worked during 1 year
i lost my job due to economic company issues, and have to register to unemployment benefits. 
In  order to calculate the daily benefits, the ALK need the PDU1 form,  where you could find information of my previous work in France.
They already have the certificate of my swiss employer where i worked for 1 year.  My plan :
i'm  planning to find something in France, so i know i won't last for long  here hopefully. I want to keep the rights of unemployment benefits in  France (who knows if i would need it later on). That's why, i don't want  the ALK to take into account these ""french"" rights, but rather, just  calculate my ""swiss"" rights.
Therefore, i could still use my ""french"" rights when i'll be back in France, if i ever need it someday.  My question :
i've seen in the net, that the PD U1 form is not mandatory.
Anyone knows more about this ? 
I need also to find the articles that states it clearly in the swiss law,
for example within AVIG (LACI in french), AVIV (OACI in french), or anywhere else.
Because i have to write them back, and i want to point them to the right article. 
If anyone knows better, please i need your skills in that.

			Not quite as straightforward as it might seem...   
First, there are there several 'types' of overtime, with different rules attached to each. There are plenty of legal regulations, but most can be adapted. It's perfectly normal and legal to not reimburse overtime (cash or in some other ways). Whatever is written in your contract is what applies.   
It is definitely not an employees' right to request a cash pay-out rather than time off. It's up to the company and many have regulations that forbid cash payments altogether. All perfectly legal.    
So as others said, best to read your contract and/or additional company regulations.

- Swiss nationals 
- EU nationals 
- non-EU nationals with some kind of working permit 
- everyone else    
In roughly that order. I'm somewhere near the bottom of the totem pole, so I understand how it works! So it's hard for anyone, even if they knew about a position to recommend you for it when there will be a lot of competition for it and you already have the disadvantage of not having a visa.

			It's common for a first year in today's times sadly, there's a lot of competition from italians who are willing to accept even less, some swiss would probably say no to that salary though, of course keep looking for better options and ask for a raise in the next 6 months. Consider a cleaning lady with no experience makes about 3200 chf, so at least 4k should be mandatory imho. 
What do you mean by ""insurance paid""? you mean the sussidi cantonali della cassa malati?

			An employment verification is only a confirmation that you were indeed employed by company X and held position Y. Salary data is normally confidential in Switzerland and are not part of such an employment verification. Exceptions might apply.   
Another option are references. However, it is strictly speaking NOT legal to ask anyone at the previous (or current) employer about you without your explicit consent. For example, if I work with company Z and am interested in hiring you, I cannot just call company X, ask for person A and inquire about you. You have to give official permission, either on your CV or in a first interview. The person you indicate as a reference may then give any information about you, your peformance, behavior, whatnot.    
In reality, this has all become a bit blurry, though...

			I have a completely different impression comparing to previous posts.   
It really depends what do you mean by front-end developer? I have impression if you are skilled and up-to-date with latest JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS, it should not be too difficult for you.   
Generally there is a huge lack of good software developers, not only in Switzerland, but in the entire world. However, the problem is that these days, way too many people name themselves ""software developers"". From my experience, all big Swiss IT companies constantly have open positions.   
I would recommend that you focus on product based companies and not on consulting ones, because there is much less contact with customers so the language requirements are much lower.   
In any case, most of companies will expect from you ether to speak some German or to be really willing to learn it. But if you really put some effort, it should not take you too long (3-4 months) to reach some level which is sufficient for everyday IT office communication. As long as you are writing good they will tolerate your poor German. Additionally in most IT companies, it will be acceptable if you are able to understand German, but you are responding in English.

1123	Employment	Legaly partime work besides full time job	draganl	1147	1	St Gallen	31.10.2014, 11:34	" 
			
			Yes, you should speak to your current employer.   
Here are some ideas which come to mind, though I don't know if this list is comprehensive.   
First, read your present contract of employment very well, and be sure you understand every paragraph. 
Then, find out about the terms of employment any fitness/sports centre might be able to offer you if you were employed there, too.  Ideally, try to obtain a copy of the kind of contract used in those fields (perhaps from someone you know who already works in a sports centre). 
Compare the two contracts and see whether either of them forbids other employment.   
There are many insurance issues surrounding employment, including accident insurance at work (Berufsunfall) and outside of work (Nichtberufsunfall), contributions to social security (AHV/IV) and to unemployment insurance, as well as the sums deducted from your salary for your contribution to a pension plan (according to the BVG law).  Your employer(s) will need to know what you are doing, so the laws about all these aspects can be fulfilled.  Depending on your income and on the number of hours you work per week, you may be ""in"" or ""out"" of some of these schemes, for one employer or the other.  And also:  in some cases the way you'd be ""in"" or ""out"" would depend not only on the conditions of employment in either job, but in the sum of hours worked, or earnings from both jobs.   
If you are considering being self-employed for the extra 30%, then you need to speak to the SVA (that's the government office in charge of AHV/IV contributions) in your canton and find out what the formal requirements are, to register as self-employed.   
Also, you need to find out (from the tax office of your ""Gemeinde"") how to properly declare your incomes.  If you have less than a ""C""-Permit, then you are currently subject to having your income taxed at source (""Quellensteuer"").  Both your employers must deduct this before they pay you your salary.  For any parts in which you are self-employed, you will need to save a portion of your income to pay to the tax office.   
Another aspect is vacation.  It is illegal not to take vacation, and your employers are not allowed to simply pay you and not give you time off.  So, you can't just work around the year and not have a break.  That wouldn't be good for your health, and that would be unfair on you, and on your employer(s).  You'd need to consider how you'd manage to coordinate your free time (talking to both bosses) so you really can take at least 2 consecutive weeks off both jobs (at the same time) so you do get a proper break.  Similarly, in case you ever want to leave, you'd need to consider that the periods of notice might not be identical.   
All this need not scare you off!  The main thing is that your first employer has a right to your working properly, and a second job shouldn't make you too tired to do the first job properly.      
Working hard can be a fine thing, if you have the time, health and determination to do it.  Your employer (and those you approach in the various government departments) may even admire you for being determined to improve your situation, especially if you are performing your tasks well already and are a trustworthy employee, and can explain that you'd like to augment your earnings because you want to save for a world trip / for your own or your child's education / for a particular hobby, etc.      
Most important of all:  if your employer(s) agree to your working for someone else as well, be sure to get their permission IN WRITING.  And keep their letter(s) safe, together with your employment contracts.

You don't have to be fluent, but you certainly need to be able to both understand and speak the basics.    
Agree with other posters; I also think tutoring might be your best option. Or publish an ad online offering whatever you might be willing to do; plenty of expats in Basel who might be just fine with you speaking only English.

			I've been through the lay-off process too (also after 6 months in the job) so can certainly sympathise with your other half, but what I have learnt in the 5 years since then here is that this lack of protection is exactly why the Swiss economy is doing so comparatively well and unemployment is so low.   
To start, yes companies are able to fire people whenever they want, but employees have the protection of an incredible unemployment insurance system if they do get fired.   
Because companies can quickly change their minds if situations change, they are not scared to hire people, so the supply and demand of labour can fluctuate quickly with people being pulled in where needed and then let go when they are not.   
Compare this to somewhere like France, where the companies will avoid as much as possible hiring anyone even when things are going well as they are virtually impossible to get rid of when the economic situation changes. The end result is unemployment being significantly higher.   
Good luck for the job hunting!

In the meantime, you should register for a jobseeker permit (L). It can be extended to 6 months if need be.   
It's not easy to find a job in your field(s) with only limited/basic language skills. Most will require at least semi-fluency. So whatever you do in the meantime, improving your language skills should be a priority. You could also get in touch with recruitment agencies (the usual big ones like Adecco, Manpower, Kelly would be a start). There's also homepages that specialize in restaurant jobs, for instance   "	8	 Jun 2013	0	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

I believe you have upto 3months to send it back but you won't get anything until you do. 
If you finished work Aug 31st you won't see any cash until mid October regardless and it won't be a full payment either as everyone has some kind of deductions.

			Are you sure that they want you to forfeit your holiday pay? Could your manager just be asking that you work to the end of December without taking any holiday, which is understandable in a transition period, then you would get any outstanding holiday paid out as is usual (and is your legal right when you leave a job, unless you voluntarily surrender it).    
I think that wanting your employer to release you a month early AND to take 2 weeks holiday at the end of it is quite a high hope, but you could certainly counter-offer that you are willing to work until 31 Dec but still get your holiday paid.   
As for the new employer, it is quite normal to have to give 3 months notice so if they want you they will have to wait until you are free to work. If they're not willing to wait then I would question whether it's the right move...

			Successfully appealed penalty for insufficient applications in notice period. The first three weeks of this two month period no applications were sent due to sickness and a two week holiday. In the appeal we referenced an earlier court verdict that it cannot be expected from a job seeker to cancel a holiday, if it has been booked before redundancy was communicated and cancellation would mean full loss of costs. Also we protested that more penalty days had been ordered than written in their own guidelines, and that anyway these guidelines mention that the overall behavior of the jobseeker should be taken into account when applying a penalty, and that in our opinion everything possible had indeed been undertaken to find a job a.s.a.p. Appeal was granted with full cancellation of penalty. It probably did help that that unemployment lasted only 2 months. BTW the guidelines for penalties are found in this useful d o cument:  http://www.koordination.ch/fileadmin/files/alv/avig-praxis/ale-d/ale_d59-d72_14.pdf  "	396	 Feb 2007	4	['2', '2']	['76', '59']	1

			Hi, welcome to the forum.   
You say partner so I take it that you're not married or in a registered same sex partnership.  In that case it's a bit more difficult as you wouldn't be assessed as a couple, but as separate singles who both must show they have enough funds to support themselves financially.  There is a way around this as the Swiss have what they call a concubine permit for non-married partners.  To get this you have to agree to support your partner financially for 5 years, even if the relationship subsequently breaks down.  He would get a residence permit, but whether that will allow him to work without facing the usual non-EU hiring restrictions I'm not sure, you'd need to check with the Zurich migration office to find out.    
I agree with Today only though, not speaking the language will make it very difficult to find employment here.  I think he could get his qualifications recognised, but he may need to take extra training before he could be employed.

			All in all it just feels weird that coming from a (slightly) inferior position in Spain to one of the most expensive hotels in GVA she would not be able to afford the same life quality (regular lifestyle btw: own flat & car, restaurants every now and then, some shopping, some travelling, etc.).      In my field salaries are very different so I have no idea. She has not turned down anything (there is always time for that), there might be a second interview but they raised already the salary question in the first one.      Thanks, that is more or less what we wanted to hear.      Thanks, and as we said at the beginning of the post we did. The numbers that come out are in the order of 7-8k. I just wanted some insider's view to double check...      She does have a master's degree although it is not in sales. Nevertheless, sales manager just means she would not be working at an entry level position (they require 3y experience in a similar role).      That is more in the line of what Downerbuzz said. I think we are getting a better idea now...         
PS: whoever is in the sector is always welcome to drop a line with more numbers...

Non-EU nationals usually must be placed via an approved agency, although I don't think that would apply in your case as I assume you already have a Swiss residence permit.  But it might be worth contacting them anyway to see if they have any vacancies.  You'd also need to have any qualifications recognised here I suspect.

			MBTI is ridiculously popular despite being about as valid as a horoscope.  I've never heard of it being used for recruitment, and no personality test (of which there are plenty of other better ones than MBTI) should be used for recruitment either.  MBTI is just for fun when you're doing some introspection.  No serious personality research will use the MBTI types nowadays.

I second 3wishes statements. It's often large companies that do these kind of tests and you have to know that they often get hundreds if not thousands of applications to one job. 80, 90% of the applications are useless, but it makes no economic sense to have a recruiter go through every application individually, well knowing that most of them are not usable. That's why they do a combination of some assessment and usually other forms to sort out the ones that are entirely unqualified anyway.    
No one cares about a long-term validation and I'd be extremely surprised if any company ever did an analysis of test results against later performance.    
And that's usually not HR's idea and certainly not the recruiters' idea... But as with anything, stupid decisions are made on a level that has no connection to reality. Nothing new. Labor, and as a consequence any HR department, is pretty much seen as a very unnecessary cost anyway.

Also work your way through the list provided on this sticky.       
For your info, when unemployed here you have to apply for a minimum of 10 jobs a month or your pay might be docked.  So 30 in 4 months isn't really that many.   
An intensive course may be a good idea.  If you can provide a certificate at the end of it, it'll give employers a base to judge your language skills on.  Bear in mind too, that often companies will pay for futher language courses once you get your foot in the door.

			We get quite a lot of threads on EF asking if a certain salary is reasonable for a certain post, or how much a person can expect with X qualification for Y job.    
To make all this easier, I suggest making an ultimate salary thread that works like this:   
-we describe a certain qualification, a certain position if possible, and the type of company (without naming them!) and approximate salaries that we know of /have heard of   
I can start with a few:   
-Chemical Engineering graduate (Masters) from one of the two polytechnic schools: you can expect to start at around 80k CHF a year, from what I've been told. Typical employers could be in pharma, chemical products, oil refining or perfumes/aromes. The cantons of Basel and Valais in particular have quite a few employers.   
-Engineering internships (graduate students): One of the polytechnic schools suggests 800.- a month as a reasonable sum, although I have known of people who have earned up to 3k a month.    
-Chemical Engineering PHD, big pharma: I was told at a job fair that salaries started at around 90k CHF a year.

Employment cannot be terminated retroactively, otherwise the whole concept of a required notice period goes up in smoke. (Say someone has a two-month notice period - fine, the company could say, we are terminating your contract effective two months ago, now scram. Obviously that can't be how it works.)   
Even in the few serious cases (embezzlement etc.) where a notice period is not required, the soonest an employment relationship can be terminated is in general ""now"", not ""last week.""   
So if you were not told until October 1 that your contract was definitely being terminated (note that sending you home for the day does not in itself constitute notice of termination) then it cannot be terminated until sometime on or after October 1, plus the normal notice period. If the normal rules apply - and do check your contract to make sure you haven't agreed to something different - then the next possible date of termination is October 31 + whatever notice period you are entitled to.

			The reason we had not done any research upfront was that Switzerland was not one of the countries we had been considering to relocate to. We had eliminated it mainly because of the housing costs, however we had not realized the likely salary would be as high as what we were offered.    
We know we need to relocate in just over a year when my step-son finishes medical school, if we want to remain together as a family. It's virtually impossible to get his GP postgraduate training in France without starting again from scratch.    
We had been mulling over returning to the UK or possibly Germany, the downside of the latter being the need to learn German first.    
However, with hindsight, this might have been quite a good opportunity - was in one of the cheaper places to live and it looks like it might might be quite easy for her son to do his postgraduate training in Switzerland, he already speaks some French, having spent a year here.   
She was rung up out of the blue, recruiter had got her details from one of her college mates he spoke to about another job. If we had of had a little more time we might very well have accepted it , just 4 days is not enough time to do all the research you need to do  on a new country. Maybe we should have asked for more time to consider, but we were given to belive that wasn't an option.

			So in Fribourg we have the following Assistant positions: 
Assistant-e-s diplômé-e-s = usually a PhD student who does research and helps with teaching 
Assistant-e-s de recherche = usually a PhD student who only does research 
Assistant-e-s médecin = Someone with a medical degree who is teaching / research 
Assistant-e-s docteur-e-s = Postdoc who does research and teaching 
Assistant-e-s docteur-e-s de recherche = Postdoc who only does research   
Tenure track doesn't really exist here like it does in other countries, so you can stay as an assistant for quite a long time (I'm already in my 6th year postdoc).

			Hi all,    
Just looking for a bit of advice before asking my ORP advisor. I've currently been on chômage in Lausanne for 2 months. I've been looking for a job seriously but nothing has come up.    
Now, due to personal reasons, I need to put my job search on hold. I won't be able to look for a job properly over the next few months, or be available for work.    
I was wondering if anyone had any experience of taking a break from chômage for several months? I will be able to go back to properly looking at the beginning of 2015.    
I'm wondering if it's possible to just be penalised for these months I'm not available, or do I need to de-register and then register again next year?   
Thanks in advance for any advice.

However the management from that point onwards is not straightforward, the quality of deliverables is poor and usually behind schedule not to mention the issues caused by time zone and cultural differences.   
I'm been involved in many offshore development projects and am yet to see which ever ended up being what I would call a success. So much better to have on site resources, a fact that companies will hopefully begin to wake up to one day!   
Sorry, rant over... good luck with the job! I'd say 100k minimum, often Swiss companies like to recruit from abroad as the swiss want the going rate, expats often take lower wages then get over here and find that the cost of living was higher than expected.   
Same happened to me, I asked for what I thought was enough to cover higher cost of living but had to negociate a raise, fortunately we came to an agreement. But much easier not to sell yourself short initially!

`What job` he asked, having forgotten all about it and actually moved to another company in the meantime . 
Incredibly, he actually accepted and did join the company . . . . but quite soon regretted it. Sometimes the way that companies treat people during and after interviews go a long way to indicating how they treat you if you were to be there.

			Hello all,   
I am faced with a rather messy situation. I am a US citizen in Switzerland as a PhD student, with a work contract and a B permit. My PhD will conclude soon, but my work contract is planned to be extended beyond that time (I think this does not affect my contract or permit type).   
Here's where it gets ugly... it is planned to change my contract in Switzerland to part time, while also receiving a part time contract from a US employer as a ""visiting scientist"". Actually, I would only visit a few times for a few weeks each, and otherwise my duties would be fulfilled remotely - while maintaining all aspects of my Swiss residency and employment.   
Is there any chance at all that this will be accepted? Or is there some slightly different way this could be handled?   
I would be very thankful to hear any advice or info from anyone who has dealt with any even slightly related scenarios, or has any knowledge on the topic.

DON'T overstay your time here as a tourist which I what I'm assuming you're here as.  It could have a detrimental affect on any future visits to Switzerland.  And if you think you've moved here permanently already, no you haven't because you have   to do so.  You need to apply for and get approval of a job offer by the Swiss authorities or be so independently wealthy that you don't need to work.  The fact that your boyfriend has a job here means nothing as far as you're concerned because you aren't in a recognised relationship, i.e. married.

Salaries are considered ""holy"" and will be paid, maybe up to 3 months late, but will be paid after the liquidation process is finalised.   
By going into liquidation the employer has nullified his workers contracts, so they have no obligation to work notice periods.   They are free to apply to RAV for compensation.  They have no obligation to resume employment with the owners of their previous firm - due to conduct of that firm.     
Usually the ""new"" salaries will be lower than their previous salary, only those truly desperate for employment would want to voluntarily sign on again with same owners.

			David,   
Disclaimer: I really don't know what I'm talking about (I'm certainly not a vet - just a dog owner who transfers pretty much all my disposable income to my vet every month   ), but...   
I would think that Jenny could start by contacting the Society of Swiss Veterinarians (Gesellschaft Schweizer Tierärztinnen und Tierärzte / Société des Vétérinaires Suisse) for information as to what would need to be done to have qualifications recognized, etc.:       
Also, there is a very good specialist / emergency clinic in Hünenberg near Zug.  It might be worth writing the practice owner for ideas where to start.        
Also, the Tierspital in Zürich, which is connected to the University of Zürich, the main veterinary teaching institution in eastern Switzerland:       
If these are not the right places to start, I'm sure someone there could better direct you.   
By the way, all the vets I have seen speak English. (As well as German and French, and a few other assorted languages. It's not uncommon to find a vet switching between 3 or 4 languages in the course of a consultation. I am always in awe of the multilingual talents of Swiss professionals.)    
However, one of my dogs is being treated by a specialist at the Tierspital who does not speak German, only English and Spanish.  He is learning German, however. He was brought over here because of his specialist qualifications, though - In a general practice I would think German would be required.     
Best of luck to you and your family, and welcome to Switzerland!

			There is nothing worse (job searching wise) than travel 100s of miles to go for an interview for a job, only to find out that they are just going through the legal motions... and the job was allocated beforehand to someone inside. 
Where there are laws requiring jobs to be advertised- they always find a way round it anyhow. The last job I got in the UK, I had been doing a temporary cover for 2 maternity leaves- and it turned out they both wanted to come back part-time. They handed me the job as I'd proven my 'worth' and we all got on famously as a team. The put a tiny advert in the local paper only, on a night where there is never any teaching vacancies. I had a 5 minute chat with the Head and 2 Deputies to confirm my appointment.   
Had anyone else applied for the job- they would have been called for interview perhaps- and their chance of getting the job would have been practically none.

As an au pair you HAVE to go through an approved agency.  Two names have already been given to you for this.   Also note that a) an au pair isn't allowed to be employed by a family who speaks the same native language as the au pair.  The whole idea is to come here and learn a new language with your host family monitoring/aiding your learning experience.  If your family doesn't speak German, French or Italian they   be able to hire you.  b) Some cantons at least insist that host families have to hold a C permit which means they've lived here for at least 5 years (EU nationals) or 10 years (non-EU).  So again your family will probably not be able to hire you.   
You have the information you require to follow up on this so use it please.  There's not much more we can do at this end.  Get your family to contact one or both of the agencies and take it from there.  Though frankly I don't think they'll have much success unless they already hold a B or C permit to live/work here.

			Hi Prok 
as Richdog said, very competitive market here.  Trilingual EU Uni grads w/internship experience are plentiful w/out permit issues. As far as fields you selected, pretty tough: 
Consulting - as recent grad you don't have specific expertise as ""hook"" 
M&A - Geneva not big for this 
Private banking - unless you have connections, likely can't quickly build a book of business 
Investment Analyst - Geneva also not big on this 
That being said, I'll be the last to trample your dreams - but you need a plan and patience (it took me 3 years of work to ""get over the pond"") 
Suggestions: 1.) Pick one field and get a couple years of experience/expertise  2.)  If M&A or IA, get this experience in NY or London where easy for American  3.) Seek firms with a branch in Geneva (transfers easier than new hires)  4.) Build widest network you can with people who have Geneva connections  5.) Get certificates (Swiss love these) like B1 French, CFA or CIIA, etc.  6.) Consider doing MBA in Europe   7.) Persevere 
Good luck!

Ask me anything.	kurtvonmoos	30133	190	Lausanne	16.01.2013, 14:15	"    Sorry to hear that you have had such a poor experience with headhunters in Switzerland. Unfortunately, you are right. There are a lot of scummy ones out there.    
In most cases, it's much more lucrative for a headhunter to secure a permanent placement rather than a temp one. The reason is quite simple:    
Temp workers need to be looked after administratively. This takes time and resources. And the commission is spread out over the duration of the contract   
vs   
With a permanent placement, the headhunter will receive the entire commission up front and there is little to no administrative work to be done.   
Perm placements are like golden eggs for headhunters and most favor them much more than temp placements.    
Also, please be aware that legal speaking, a headhunter is NOT ALLOWED to shop your CV around with your authorization. It's considered poor practice, is frowned upon and very risky for the headhunter.

1261	Employment	Working out a daily rate as a contractor	grimmus	4355	12	e	01.09.2010, 11:25	"    If you are going through an agency, the rate they quote you will be minus the percentage they will rake off whatever the client has paid them. If you use the agent as a brolly, they will then come up with some baroque remuneration scheme where they pay you a ""salary"" making deductions for holiday and sick pay, pension, tax, social contributions etc. They may well do some shenannigens with claiming an expenses ""Pauschal"" as a way to reduce your taxable income.   
If you contract directly with a client and use a brolly company (e.g. UFD of Basel) they will usually charge a percentage of your fee (IIRC UFD charge SFr10 / hour for rates up to SFr100 / hour and 10% for rates over). Otherwise if you have your own GmbH then you would be director and employee and you would need the help of an accountant to organise your remuneration. For us the latter worked out to be the most cost-effective option.   
Unless you plan to have many clients running in parallel, then sole trader may not be an option. If you are working for the same client for an extended period the AHV office may well see this as disguised employment and start taking an interest. To decide the best option you should really see a professional advisor rather than taking advice from the armchair lawyers on EF - as getting it wrong can be expensive.   
In fact, I would get professional advice before deciding what your minimum rate is going to be (   - Gabrielle Grether - is a good person to talk to in this regard ) as you want to make sure it is worth your while depending on the corporate structure you intend to adopt.   
Cheers, 
Nick

1 - Your working on the premise that a HR Manager exists, and in a small company may not. An annual slip containing all legal entries IS sufficient, and in a small firm it presents a saving in time and money over monthly slips.    
2 - A firm makes a policy decision on when it issues payslips, the content of the slip is laid down in statute, and they must comply. You used the word demand, and that would make the op's wife look foolish, asking is a different matter. If the company does not provide monthly but annually what is your issue? No payslips at all is a different matter, and the op should verify with the SVA to make sure his wife has the social charges deducted.   
3 - Should extra ordinary payments be made, then a revised slip can be made, still much less admin and paper.    
I have used my annual slip for a car lease and a new apartment, and it never presented a problem.

1287	Employment	Swiss Salary Negotiations	Skip	3552	33	Jersey	29.07.2014, 14:13	" 
			
			Swiss companies are the worst negotiators on the planet. So don't worry youreself. Just play their game. Ultimately they don't care about you, so don't care about them.   
Unfortunately, you're only worth what the market is paying (regardless of anything you read). You will first have to find an alternative employer who will pay more.... or else why would they bother to pay you more?   
""Walk"" is the only real negotiation point you have to start with. But you would really want to have that alternatitive or else you'll look like a right twat when they call your bluff.   
It doesn't matter as much if the alternative company isn't as good, but focus on ALL the factors to make sure you do have 'better conditions' or else they will kill you on detail (insurances, benefits, etc. it all weighs in).   
When you have a stronger offer, and they say that ""they can't negotiate on base salary"" or whatever.... throw the question back at them ""What aspects can you negotiate with in compensation?""     
Mostly, you'll probably find that they are just stupid arrogant pricks who follow an outdated HR spreadsheet and lack all ability to think outside the square.... but this is not your fault, so don't take it personally.     
Unless you're absolutely desperate for work right now, I wouldn't take the offer if you think it's that bad. If you're confident with your market stats, then hold out for what you need. 
If you need the money now, then take it anyway and immediately begin to look around for another job.   
Negotiations are only ever as successful as the person you are negotiating with. ""You need"" to make ""them need"" to pay you more. If they don't 'need' to, they won't pay you more than they have to - simples.

1292	Employment	Vacations during first year	milsam	1764	20	Basel	27.07.2014, 19:21	" 
			
			Contrary to other countries, Switzerland has no ""no vacation during probation period/first year/whatever"" rule. You can take a vacation any time, upon agreement with your boss/team of course.    
If working there for four months, by December, you will have enough vacation days to take two weeks off. December 25 and 26 as well as January 1 are national public holidays, so you won't need to take any vacation days out of your allowance for either of these three days.    
Even if you don't have sufficient vacation days, it's usually no big deal and you'll just transfer the negative balance of 2014 into 2015, effectively of course reducing the amount of vacation days you have for next year. Most companies allow employees to do that, though they are not obliged to.   
And in the absolute worst case of you not continuing to work there beyond the four months and in case you've then taken more vacation days than you were entitled to during your employment, they will deduct them from your final salary.

			They are obliged to pay you for that last day, period. There is zero room for negotiation or discussion here. What HR told you is of course absolute BS.   
Send a   requesting them to transfer the outstanding money and set a deadline (can be a few days only). You can write that you EXPECT payment by date XY and in case they don't come through, you will take the necessary next steps.    
In case they still don't pay within that deadline, take it to a lawyer. Or call here:   upfront to ask them what they recommend you do. Even if you end up taking a lawyer, you have right on your side and will win, hence there's no need to worry about costs.

			I can say from first-hand experience that having Swiss experience means everything. Someone who has shown that they have already worked in a Swiss setting is much more assuring to a future employer than someone who doesn't have Switzerland anywhere on their CV. It means you were able to prove to someone during the interview process that you're worth hiring and by keeping the job that you're able to work well in a Swiss office. I started off volunteering for a large NGO several hours a week immediately when I arrived whilst I searched for a job. I then started an internship and after that ended, I was able to get job and then another. I started well below what I was qualfied to do but eventually ended up where I wanted to be just 1.5 yrs later. Gain whatever experience you can get and once you can put Switzerland on your CV many doors will open!      "	2	 Jul 2014	0	['0', '0']	['1', '1']	0

			I would point out that while it might take until 2016 to get citizenship it also might not.  It could happen sooner than that.   
You could look at moving to Geneva and starting the process again, but iirc some, if not all, cantons have their own residency requirements before you can apply for citizenship if you live in that canton.  So you could find that she'd have to wait, say, another 5 years before she could apply in Geneva if that's part of their requirements.   
I would stick with the job and continue hunting for a new one.  What else have you done besides LinkedIn?  Try these:          (you can change the Location Setting to Switzerland)

			I live next door to the International School of Bern and a friend of mine works there.. This is my biggest hope to join this school .. I have all the experience and qualification for it but it is such a small school , they have hardly any vacation eveyr year. Last year they had 3 and this year not many more.. Maybe you will have more chance with your subject.. this school offers the PYP , MYP and IB program so you need to get information about this curriculum.    
If you want to teach abroad, I know that some international schools employ teachers with your profile. My last working place in Shanghai is doing just that! And I confirm that Australia don't recognise the QTS!   
The main problem here in the local system, is that most teachers are trained to teach up to 3 or 4 subjects and I had confirmation by the EDK, that although I am now allowed to teach in all Swiss local schools ( Secondary stufe 1) , all jobs are first given to Swiss nationals...

1301	Employment	What is the role of a HR agency?	PhEnSuisse	1356	4	Lausanne	18.07.2014, 21:10	" 
			
			Bottom line is the client of a recruitment agency is the would-be employer, not the candidate. As a result, you're just a resource or product - on of many - that they will try to sell to a client in the hope that they bite, as they only get paid on a 'sale'.   
As a result, recruiters are principally salespeople, so it's not uncommon to see shabby practices, misuse of personal data and the like. This appears to be an industry-wide problem.   
In a few rare cases, they will put in a modicum of effort in pushing candidates, typically if they think the profile is good (or the role is high enough that the commission will merit the extra effort). The rest of the time it appears to be a numbers game, with many flinging as many CV's that they think they can get away with in the hope one will stick.   
It's also not uncommon to find that they have limited knowledge in the area they're recruiting for, so seeing ads that seek five years experience is something that's only been around for two is commonplace.   
My advice is always approach a company directly if you can. If you see a job advert, copy some of the text and Google it. As many specs are lazy cut 'n paste jobs, you'll often find the original company Web site advertising the same job and be able to apply directly.   
If you do have to use a recruiter, it's very much a case of learning from experience. To begin with, you do have to have a thick skin to a large degree. Sending an application, only to have no reply at all, is par for the course, so don't take it too much to heart.   
The agency's reputation is no guarantee of quality as professionalism seems to vary hugely even within firms. Give them a try, see how they treat your application and if they treat you shabbily, keep a record and blacklist them - most jobs are not tied to any agency, so next time round better to go via an agency that has not wasted your time in the past.   
Conversely, if you have a good experience with an agency (such as; how they work with you on 'tweaking' your application, keep you informed throughout the process or coach you prior to an interview) then flag them for future collaboration and connect via LinkedIn / Xing to the recruiter as you'll want to be able to context them again next time around as they may have changed agency in the meantime.

I will let you know if I do go to the chomage office and keep you in the loop.

			I assume that if the employer has terminated the contract then their HR department may no longer be willing to deal with the insurance company over this, but it seems a bit strange just the same to contact you directly.  If, as said in the link 3Wishes provided, your notice period can't start until you're back at work, then technically you're still employed by them and HR should be dealing with the insurance side.    
Alternatively, give Zurich your doctor's details and they can follow it up with him/her as they should be able to give the insurance a better idea of your prognosis than you can.    
Good to hear that RAV is helping you sort things out.  We get lots of comments about how bad they can be, so it's nice to hear that not all are the same when people need their help.

			Hi my name is Philipp and I just completed the registration to this forum as I might be able to shed some light into this indeed very complex issue.    
As I am a German native speaker I had a look into the Swiss ""Arbeitslosenversicherungsgesetz"". My understanding of the Arbeitslosenversicherungsgesetz is, that in order to be entitled to Swiss unemployment benefits you should have contributed to the Swiss social security system for at least 12 month in a 24 month period. As you wrote correctly in your first post, you did not contribute into the Swiss social security system for 5 consecutive years before you have been assigned to UAE, hence, you haven't been entitled to pay at least ""voluntary"" social security contributions under the Swiss law for the duration of your assignment.    
Even if you would have stayed on the Swiss payroll throughout your assignment, this does not change the fact that you have not been under the Swiss social security system for the duration of your assignment.    
According to your first post, you have been in the UAE for 1.5 years, therefore, you did not pay social security contributions in Switzerland for at least 12 month during the past 24 month. I am sorry, but for me it seems that you are not entitled to Swiss unemployment benefits.    
Please note that this is just my interpretation of the law. As I am a Tax Advisor (mainly for MNE's) social security is not my main subject, so I would suggest to call the Swiss ""Bundesamt für Sozialversicherungen"" to be completely sure. Here is the link:     
These guys are very helpful and are very competent when it comes to international issues as yours.    
Good luck!

You will have to be offering something that isn't readily available locally. Mere experience in the industry is unlikely to be enough.

			There is another point to consider...   
What if you were not the first choice of your new employer ?    
But the first choice could not start until the 1st October, or possibly the 15th September ?    
If you are not available on the 1st September then they may very well have second thoughts about you. On the other hand, maybe they won't. It really depends on what the new assignment is and how much they need you.   
If the new assignment is really worth while, then best to exit your current position earlier, whatever the cost. It would be extremely difficult to finish end of August in one country and then start right away in the other. At the same time, keep in close contact with the new employer, giving him updates on the progress of your move and gently let on that you are having some problems on getting an early release from your current work but you are trying to resolve the problem.    
Talk to them.

			I think you're too early by a few months to get the 3 months minimum notice. The employer is probably aware of this.    
You need to work 10 years to have a right to 3 months of notice, otherwise it's 2 months like you said in your first post.    
That means you'd have to wait until it's 10 years (I have no idea if that would mean the first day of october, or the date written on your contract, or the first day of november) to have a right to 3 months notice. But the contract says 2 months, I don't know if the law overrules that, it probably does.    
If the boss wants you gone because he doesn't have enough business, I don't see why he would extend your employment further than he needs to anyway.  
If he wanted to give you one more month out of goodwill, he would give your notice in august so that you'd work september and october. That's his choice though.

			Another thing to consider: What is the goal for your children?   
University? If so, where - US, Switzerland, elsewhere?   
Consider where you see your children heading while weighing the pros and cons of local vs. interantional school.   
---   
Just re-read your post and saw that ""Technically, this isn't an expat position, it's a local contract..."" this puts you in a more difficult negotiating position. Certainly at OH's company that would mean no benefits, and definitely no help with international schools. But who knows what your potential employer would agree to - how good are your negotiating skills?    
(Do remember you are taxed on the value of most benefits - so evaluate any perk in those terms. The value of tuition for three children will likely put you over the threshold where Uncle Sam's tax bite starts to hurt... )

			... and pretty much all of this boils down to: speak to the EDK, & the Cantonal education authority in any canton(s) in which you wish to teach. You   find the EDK will insist on fluency in a national langauge in order to teach (in addition to appropriate tertiary qualifications), while the Cantonal authority will just want your tertiary qualifications recognised by the EDK and give you some leniency on the language fluency (while working under their jurisdiction).   
If you can identify a local school which really wants you to work for them then they'll be a great help in terms of identifying the hoops through which you need to jump, and helping you jump. Doing it on your own would be a tough slog.

			Assuming he's a Greek national, getting a permit is no big deal and no, an employer would not need to prove that he's more qualified than a Swiss person. EU citizens can come to Switzerland any time without visa and permit, but stay only for three months as a tourist to look for a job. They may then apply for a jobseeker (L) permit, which will be issued for another three months. Ergo OP can stay a total of six months, provided obviously he has the funding that would allow him to stay in this very expensive country for so long without any income.    
This is the current status, as you all know, it remains to be seen whether Switzerland will, in the future, allow (more or less) unrestricted movement of EU nationals.   
Agree on the language issue, though, with no German or French, depending on which part of Switzerland, there's pretty much no way you, OP, will find a job here. Better to look for countries where you actually speak the local language.

As far as pensions go they'll simply pay the proportion that you earned with them into your pension funds and likewise you'll get a salary statement at the end of the year for inclusion on your tax return which you'll have to fill in yourself as the salary would be over 120k.

Nevatheless, assuming we are dealing with experienced professionals (not quite managers or C lvl) in not a highly specified field like life science  with good CVs, it all comes down to: 
Nationality and permit. Obviously, if one needs a work permit - no chances. If one doesnt need a work permit and is nonEU, there are chances, but still not as big as with EU candidates 
Work experience/ study in Switzerland. If one has never worked here and doesnt have swiss degree - chances go down dramatically

If you already know the potential future coworker, and you have already built a certain degree of raport and confidence with him/her, then I would say definitely do meet that person for coffee.  However, even thought it helps to know that person's perspective, you must make your own decisions based on your own gut feeling.    
Sometimes the employer might invite you for an ""informal"" dinner / coffee with the potential co-workers to get to know you in a more relaxed environment.  This is always a good thing, because you get to meet the whole team you will be working with.  But in situations where this doesn't happen, then you just take a risk.  It's all about gut feeling and how well you connect with people in the end.

			It depends on the headhunting/recruitment agency. Some agencies may not work on mandates but are on the 'preferred supplier list' and have a good relationship with the hiring company.    
If this is the case, you can guarantee that the company has chosen to use agencies because they can't handle the volume of applications on their own. The hiring managers use the agencies to filter the applications down for them.    
Point is, companies will have a budget for agency spend. They won't necessarily choose candidates who came in directly over those from agencies just because they can save a few bucks. The advantage going through a decent agency is that they will lobby the hiring manager/HR on your behalf. So in this case it's an advantage to go through the agency.    
If you do choose to go through a headhunter/agency, the trick is to find a decent one to work with who knows the client well.

- in the motivation letter, she wrote: ""Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren"" instead of addressing to a concrete HR-person...   
now, having changed her application she has received some phone calls from various companies. Therefore, instead of surfing Internet and listen to people some of which have no ideas, go and buy such a book for you.    
I am sure that there are plenty of such books (see publishers ""Duden"" or ""Stark"", for instance).    
The criterias and trends for CV and motivation do change almost every year.   
Imagine, a recruiter/HR-manager receives 1000 e-mails for a position. Do you think, he will read each of them? Of course, NO. First letter: starts with ""Sehr geehrte Damen..."" - trash!; second letter - unclear to which position a person applies - trash!; third letter - too much information and CV in .doc-format - trash! Only in this way, a recruiter will have 50-100 applications which have chance to be read.    
Therefore, yes, it is important to follow these trends.

Personally, I think she will rather have to go for the bigger companies anyway, considering her research focus.

			Well while I can agree with many of your points, this was not my experience, as what you refer to as an A client, last year:      I handed in the form to UNIA like everyone and got the calculations back about a week later with no issues.   
I was told not to bother bringing any evidence of job searching as they would take my word for it.  And to just send them an email once a month updating them on my progress, which I did.   
I was told that I needed to be in a position to respond to them within two days, should they contact me.  But they never did.   
The meeting itself lasted about 15 minutes and was conducted in Swiss German.  At the meeting the advisor told me that she previously worked for a well known recruitment agency and that she was pretty confident I'd find something within six months and that if I had not, we'd have another meeting then.   
Well she was right and I never did have a second meeting!

If they can't prove that, then the transfer will not go ahead.   
Check that with the migration office too when you contact them.  The more info you can get the better your chances of the application being successful.

			I agree with the above.    
Do you have an alternative source of income?  You definitely need to see the RAV and also consider you options if you cannot get good work soon.   
As for overpaying your salary, you could argue that they did that at their own discretion, and you would have made alternative arrangements sooner if you had known they would not pay your salary. I have the feeling that there is little the employer can do except refuse to pay your salary from x date.    
Out of interest, were you being paid a 'proper' adult/assistant's salary (upwards of 3500chf per month for full time work), or a practicum wage (1000-2000 chf per month)... Was it a long term contract or a fixed term (practicum so should be only up to one year)....

Amazingly many countries have flourishing economies, even while paying with the minimum legal wage.    
I am very sad the minimum wage bill has been rejected. I read recently  that all the bonuses paid out, would easily pay for the lowest wage  earners to avoid social security.

1389	Employment	How to employ a cleaner  ( and some tips to cleaners who apply):)	guest	1326	0	null	1.1.0001, 00:00	" 
			
			Hello  
I was recently searching for a cleaner and received quite some PMs both for the job as well as request for advice from other people searching for a cleaner.   
I thought of adding my experience and some documents which I took the trouble to translate.. hopefully this makes life easier for other.    
Some other threads to be referenced    {but some of the links from Natu in that thread were no longer working},               
- If someone (at least that was for me) is posting an ad on English forum for a cleaner, mostly it is for the forum community. People with 0 to 1  posts, in my humble opinion, please take the trouble to post your introduction as a bare minimum before directly applying for a Job 
- While applying please have the following details at hand - permit type, hourly rate, type of services which you can perform and most importantly references. 
- It might help your prospective employer with the various steps he/she needs to take for hiring a cleaner 
If you have no prior experience as a cleaner or lack references, consider joining an agency or registering with a company like quitt.ch  or   ( search internet)     
- avoid moonlighting .. link   from SECO in German but google translate does ok in translating the essence. You are much better off with either a cleaning company or hiring someone through an agency like quitt or homeservice if you do not want the headache of contracts, withholding tax etc.   
If you want to take this ordeal of hiring someone on your own read on. 
After you have  
- First and foremost, when you post an ad or if you are conversing with cleaners provide clear information on the approx size of the apartment, location as well as the frequency of cleaning desired. ( additionally if you are looking at other services like ironing, gardening, baby sitting etc.)   
- When contacted, ask for permit type, AHV number, references, hourly rate as well as try to get a general idea of the location where they are staying (EF profile mostly helps).. I had a few newbies applying for whom travel time to my place would have been prohibitive.   
- If you have narrowed down the list of people based on what ever criteria you want, talk to their references, meet them in person and let them view the apartment to get an idea of the time they would need to clean the house. Ideally get a verbal agreement on the time.   
- calculate the overall cost based on the hourly wage, permit type and approx time estimate to check if all is in agreement for you as well as the cleaner. Refer attached salary budget calculator. Refer attached zip file.. I had downloaded the original calculator from the   and translated all the fields to English to better understand the terms 
I used the billing procedure ""Vereinfachtes"" for B Permit holder,  ""Ordentliches"" for C Permit / Swiss nationals. I do not know when to use ""Ordentliches mit Quellensteuer"" (also think there is a bug in the xls for this option  )     
- The first post  pretty much summarizes what you need to do as an employer once you have finalized the cleaner.. hence I wont repeat that here. 
Only addition is that based on permit type (i.e for B ) you would need to withhold tax and pay to the canton authorities at the end of the year along with the standard deductions.   
- Additionally please do take the trouble to give references to your cleaner. Many people make their decision based on that. If your cleaner is doing a good job at your place, I think apart from their salary they have earned their right to give you as a reference. 
Thank you all who took out time to be references and taking time out to talk to me a giving an honest feedback, instead of a ""rosy everything is great"" feedback.   
I cant think of anything else right now.. will add to the thread if I remember something.

			Unless your contract specifically states otherwise, a notice period is always to the end of the month. So if you receive your notice on let's say May 15 and have two months of notice period, you'll be employed until 31 July.   
The legal notice periods have been posted already by fatmanfilms; these can be extended as desired by the employer, but the specific notice periods that apply to you are written in the employment contract.

			So, I got further information from my previous employer. They spoke with the Ausgleichskasse Zug, apparently I have the right for the maternity leave even if I am not in the country.   
But they alerted me that it would likely be reduced. The reason is that I will not have a salary from unemployment benefit if I leave the country and this affects the total amount I am entitled to for the maternity leave.   
For more info they sent me this link:    
Apparently it is important that I keep my residency in Switzerland and that my husband is employed in  Switzerland and that I come back.   
I guess this is it. Now I will go get a calculator and see if I can afford this all, or if I stay here.

If they can afford a ski holiday AND expect more from their employee, then they can pay.   
Your 'waiter' example is flawed in that the more people at a table, proportionally the cost of the table increases, and yes, the waiter could possibly expect more tip.   
A teacher has the same syllabus regardless of the amount of pupils in the class room....... I'm sure you've attended a university lecture.     
The work load HAS increased outside the original agreement, she has a right to review the pay conditions, or decline.   
She may price herself out of the market, but if she doesn't ask, then nothing changes at all.

1400	Employment	Question(s) about Pharma Industry	jafx	808	0	Heredia, Costa Rica	24.05.2014, 18:46	" 
			
			I've done a few weeks of searching, (thank you all for the informative posts on this forum!!,) and I still had a few questions I want to double check on.   
A brief background: I am a Pharmacy student in Costa Rica, US citizen. Once graduated I will hold the equivalent of a Msc. in the European system (300 ects credits.)   
My wife and I are starting some high German classes around the beginning of 2015. We will have three years of German under our belts, and we are already bilingual in Spanish / English. (C1 English and Spanish.) We can converse with Italian speakers fairly well. I hate French. Not the French, just their language. I can read it fairly well, but it's unintelligible to me audibly.   
What can we do to make ourselves more marketable to the Pharma industry in Switzerland? Ideally we would prefer to go straight to Switzerland and get some experience in the industry. If that is an improbability we will be moving to Spain to obtain Phd's in Industrial Pharmacy and EU citizenship. Still, that's two to three years I'd rather spend in Switzerland if possible. (Citizenship in two years is a possibility for us because I have a retirement already from my service in the military which allows us to apply for a permanent residency. After this my wife, who is a natural citizen of Iberoamericana, is entitled to naturalize after two years of said permanent residency. With a marriage certificate proving at least one year of preexisting marriage to a Spanish citizen, I can get citizenship as well. Essentially giving us citizenship at the same time.)   
Currently, it appears that we may be able to volunteer at a local non-profit biological research laboratory, but that's not directly related to chemistry so I was unsure if it would be useful. I have yet to find volunteer opportunities outside of the research laboratories in the local Universities that are more chemistry related.   
To finish our degree we will be required to do a 300 hour internship in either a hospital or industrial research lab. Considering the only research labs I know of here are Novartis, GSK, and a few local companies that compound generics, I've considered going that route to try to beef up the resume.   
Can you think of anything else I'm missing that would help make us competitive? I'm a bit of a planner; must be the old soldier in me.   
There are no summer breaks in this country; three semesters a year. Yet, we are able to take time off if we like. Would it be worth applying for an internship experience with one of the big Pharma companies before we graduate? What would be a good year to do so, after the Bachelors and before the Masters, or perhaps the last year of the Bachelors?   
Thanks to all, and I apologize if I failed to find the answers to these questions, were said answers to have previously been posted elsewhere.

J2EE  and dotNet (C#), most certainly. Mobile - iOS absolutely, Android  increasingly and even Windows Phone is making an appearance in job ads.  Web, there's demand, but there's also a certain level of oversupply from  what I can see, especially in languages such as PHP.   
In banking  and finance, there's still demand, but it's a lot less than six or seven  years ago, as there appears to be a lot of outsourcing to the  developing World there (ironically, this has increased demand for PMs  with outsourcing experience). Pharma appears to be buoyant and still  hiring.   
Overall, demand I've found has increased substantially in 2014, compared to two or three years ago, or last year for that matter.   
So  yes, depending upon what your area is - at least from my own  superficial observations, based on the frequency and quality of recruiter pitches I  get.

I think I should become a Swiss citizen since I will loose my C permit if I leave Switzerland for more than two years (I am not completly sure of that) and maybe I will.   
I guess our most realistic way to go to live in Switzerland is if my girlfriend finds a good enough job to receive a work permit.

			If the OP is applying for a job that used that exact terminology, i.e. ""university degree"", then that is not a job with an American company, in my opinion, and the OP should be following the advice given by others on this thread.   
An American company will specify a minimum level requirement of:   
High School Diploma 
Certificate of Achievement in a specific field 
Two-Year Degree, (Associate's Degree) in a specific field 
Four-Year Degree, (Bachelor's Degree) in a specific field 
Master's Degree in a specific field 
Doctorate in a specific field   
The generic term ""university degree"" tells me that this is a company headquartered somewhere else besides America, so the above criteria do not apply.

			Learn German. Or French.    
In big pharma and also biotech/healthcare/medtech, there's few entry-level positions (in Switzerland that is) and with no specialization (Masters) and no experience, it'll be difficult. Generally, you don't necessarily need to speak a local language to get a job with the biggest pharmas here (half the people working at these companies speak not a single word of any local language) - however on the level you would enter, only English won't get you far. Sales Rep is a possibility, but there's no chance without speaking either German or French (and usually preferably even both).    
Alternatives are probably jobs in government/health agencies, hospital administration etc., but they will all require a local language as well, so will smaller NPOs. Maybe healthcare consulting could be an alternative (business analyst level) - but it's probably a very long shot.    
You are unlikely to find a job that is not related to your degree, even less so if you don't speak the local language. I know this is not what you want to hear...

If you are doing it because you would really enjoy teaching English, it would be worth it simply because you can do something you enjoy.  
If you would prefer to do something else, it might be better to start a course of study or something leading you down a road you would really enjoy and thus enjoy the work of the certification and what it brings you.

1429	Employment	Wage for admin assistant Lausanne and how much rent to pay?	Lausanne345	1445	2	renens	08.05.2014, 18:18	" 
			
			Rule of thumb: not more than one third of your GROSS salary for rent.   
To pay 50% of a net salary for rent is a recipe for disaster. There's many people who can't afford an apartment of their own especially in larger cities, so flatsharing is common.   
Entry-level salary for an admin is probably some 4500.-/month gross, not net, but likely 13 salaries, so some 58k p.a. total compensation. But it also depends a bit on the company. An assistant at H&M would earn less than 4500.-/month.   
Not sure if you're from Switzerland or not, but please be aware that taxes and health insurance are not deducted from your gross salary, but need to be paid separately. The only part that is deducted directly from your salary are social security costs (old-age insurance, pension fund, unemployment insurance etc.) - none of which are negotiable, but mandatory and fixed in their amount.    
So at the end of the day, you can expect to have some 60% of your gross salary available at your disposal, to pay for rent, food and all other expenses (other insurances, phone, transportation, electricity, clothing, holidays, going out and whatnot). Depending on the health insurance you pick and where you live exactly, it might be a little more or a little less.

			Your employment cannot be terminated when you are pregnant....   
So, the notice period is suspended and if they want to terminate your contract after the maternity leave is complete, they should pay the 16 weeks plus the notice period, which would be 1-3 months depending on your contract.   
However, you are expected to work right up until the time when the doctor puts you on sick leave, and they are free to restructure or reassign your job within the company if it is not hugely unreasonable.

Thank you for your clarifications but since I already made the request to open a company and got a reply from AVS, I already know what the name must contain and other issues linked to a freelancer account. I am not opening it, it's already open.   
I actually filled in the details on startbiz.ch, where they also check if the company name is available, etc.   
What I am unclear is that I just got that AVS file with temporary taxes and the affiliate id. No mention whatsoever on the company name (that it was reserved, that I can use it). But I assume this is the responsibility of the Chamber of Commerce, so I assume I must register there for the name.   
Or I can stay unregistered and just use the Affiliate ID, since this is all I have as identifier.   
I was under the impression that we can use any bookkeeping software, as long as we show entries and exits, but I assume it must be swiss made, even though I won't have more than 3-4 invoices / month

1458	Employment	Should I put current boss into my CV as referee?	PhEnSuisse	2382	7	Lausanne	27.04.2014, 16:54	" 
			
			Hell no!   
If you have a very transparent and honest relationship with your boss, you may discuss upfront with him that you'd like to look for a new job. I did this once, years ago, but I had an extraordinarily good relationship with my boss at the time. But if you don't have that, NEVER put down your current boss' name down as a referee. Chances are you'll be fired pretty much right away.     
I never provide names of referees upfront, but always write ""references upon request"". The earliest I provide a name is after the first interview, usually even only after the second. I always make it superclear that I do not want them to contact my current boss, and give them one or two other names of people they can speak with, usually from previous employers or from people outside my direct team. It's different if I've already quit; then I have no problem providing my boss as a referee (provided I didn't have a massive argument with him and he was the reason I quit) - but I also only do so after the first or second interview with a new company.   
I know these days companies ask for references upfront, but you're not obliged to provide any. And even more importantly, for data privacy reasons, it is illegal in Switzerland to obtain references from any person/employer without your explicit consent.   
If, despite this, you want to provide a referee upfront, pick one from a former employer. Or maybe you have an (internal) client/customer, colleague, mentor or whatnot in the company you currently work with and who you can fully trust - you can inform them that you're looking for a new job and use them as a referee.

1463	Employment	Salary raise request-need an advice	marta2014	1389	2	Zug	22.04.2014, 16:03	" 
			
			Advice above is fairly sound, especially in keeping the number in the 3-9% range, which is high for an annual raise, but reasonable. One other point - make sure there is no collective bargaining in place. We have it at my sight and if anyone asked for an incremental raise on top of the collective raise I would not take it well.   
Generally, though, when I have been asked - if I liked the person and they put a reasonable number out there, they usually got it straight away, though I let them spell out their reasons. Said differently, their reasoning didn't affect my decision-making, unless they said something awful. When people have failed they have cited:   
1. Other people's salary.  
2. That their job is inherently hard/tough/sucky. 
3. They don't like their hours.   
Generally - avoid anything that says ""I'm unhappy, but I will continue to be unhappy here for more money."" The end of that story is always the same - they still leave as soon as they find something else. Or they make someone else unhappy. When some sort of threat of quitting (implied or explicit) comes through, I pull out two copies of the blank resignation letters I keep in my desk and ask them to sign. It's harsh, but I've learned over the years that this game is never worth playing.   
Be positive, should that you are someone I want on the team and want to invest in, and, again, ask for something reasonable. IF you want a big number (>10%, or even >5% depending on the company) I need to see that your job description has changed or that you have really moved up in what you do.

1465	Employment	Academic jobs in Switzerland (post postdoc)	happyeye	3719	7	Lausanne	20.04.2014, 15:56	" 
			
			I don't know how it is in your field but I think it is widespread that getting a permanent position after ""only"" 4 years of postdoc in this age you would have to be really very, very good. 
The situation appears to be that you have to be very good to get one after 6 or 8 years anyway...   
Starting now: I think you should take the position. That is an easy decision because it keeps you employed and you don't seem to have alternatives right away! 
Just because you sign on another postdoc you do not have to stop applying for other jobs (academic or not). There was a fairly recent thread where someone else was considering leaving academia and was also asking whether to continue to another postdoc. The consensus there was also to take the position (and apply outside during that contract).   
Looking to the future: You should really consider what are your future prospects, and evaluating whether you should switch outside earlier or not. 
I don't have personal experience here but I think there is some consensus that employers outside academia are a bit reluctant to pick up an ""older"" (35+?) scientist with no ""real life experience"" - as you are in IT maybe that problem is not as significant but it is something to keep in mind.   
This is not meant to dissuade you from staying in academia, but it is important to be realistic. 
You have at least one extremely significant handicap because due to your significant other, you are limiting yourself to a small geographical area so I think in your case you really must consider positions outside academia sooner rather than later. On the other hand, presumably your significant other is well employed so perhaps you can afford the ""risk"" that you will have to get an ""early retirement"" after several temporary positions and eventually not getting a permanent one. 
Positions in Switzerland must be extremely competitive compared to many other countries in Europe: the universities are well known and the salaries are high(er).   
There are some options already pointed out, there are SNSF positions that give you ""advanced postdoc"" options, and the same goes for EU-funded ones (provided Switzerland is still in Horizon 2020 - if not maybe you can apply to an EU-country institution close to the border if that is acceptable). These are also very competitive, but they are aimed at your experience level.

1466	Employment	Living in UK, working remotely for a Swiss company	Frop	1212	0	Wales	20.04.2014, 17:52	" 
			
			I have been offered a job as a software developer with a company in Zürich.   
I will continue to live in the UK and will work remotely, but will spend around two weeks every three months in Zürich.   
I will be paid a monthly salary, and will be their only employee in the UK.   
According to the contract, for the periods that I spend in Switzerland deductions will be made just as they would be for any other employee:   
For the other weeks of the year, I will have to take care of doing these correctly myself in the UK.   
I am not familiar with such arrangements, and I think that this is a first for the employer too.    
Is this the standard way of going about things? It does seem to me that having a salary that is taxed partially in the UK and partially in Switzerland will make things quite complicated for me, and having a pension based on contributions of a mere 8 weeks a year seems inefficient.   
Any advice would be appreciated!

			Yeah there's probably no market for teaching Welsh   Mia is right, hehe, we call the French part ""Welschland""    
However, if you have experience in corporate learning and training, I would say there are some opportunities. I work in a similar field. Larger organizations have started to outsource much of their L&D and training activities to smaller firms and independent consultants, though. I don't know if that applies to all industries, but typically if one starts, others follow      
If I were you, I'd look into both larger corporations and agencies and maybe also HR consultancy firms (such as Towers Watson). Some of them do a lot of Comp & Ben work, so it might not be an ideal fit, but why not look into them, they also do other things across the whole HR spectrum. In either of the above, it's probably not the end of the world if you don't speak German (I'm assuming you don't).   
And there'd definitely be a market for English teachers and if you get a certification to teach English especially for adults, I'm sure you'd find an opportunity at a language school or as a private tutor.

			I am a web developer. That is, I create websites and develop applications mainly in HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript + their respective various frameworks, the whole nine yards! I've a portfolio of 9 live websites + a personal one, and some contributions to the opensource community.  I have an intermediate experience in sysadmin too. i.e. VPS\Linux\Centos...      
I would like to get a job here in Switzerland. I have actually worked for a company for some months as web developer. Then I had to quit on personal reasons. Now, I would like to get some sort of diploma/attestation as I have currently none except for one from the company I worked for.   
In-order to have a diploma though, I would have to pay CHF 100+ for under 2 hours courses, this would take me thousands of Francs, just to even learn what I already know. I also doubt that, because most of the courses I've seen are aimed at beginners, intermediates while I have been using and learning with the most up-to date tools and practices in the industry.    
So, this leaves me wandering if there are any type of exams, such as the one I took recently called DELF/DALF where I only had to pay CH F280.00 for a 90 minute test, for a French language exam and got my diploma/attestation afterwards without having had to provide any previous documents. Is such thing possible in Switzerland, particularly for web development?  
I know for a fact there is a ZEND Certification, for PHP developers in Germany and Symfony Certification in France but not in Suisse.   
So, I would like to know to obtain any valuable attestation by having to take a test only.

			Well, here are a couple of websites which might help:         
But you have to realise that to be able to hire you, any potential employer has to prove to the Swiss authorities that they couldn't find a Swiss, EU national or someone else already living here with a Swiss permit who could do the job.  That means you're last in the queue for consideration so unless you can fill a niche or have outstanding skills/experience it's going to be very difficult to find a job here.  This is what any employer would have to do:       
Plus English isn't a Swiss language so there are very few jobs that need only that language.  You really need to speak a Swiss language fluently as even jobs that mention English will also want German, French or Italian depending on which part of the country the job's based in.

			Unfortunately, that probably sums up your job possibilities too.  Even if there are jobs like waitressing in the more tourist based areas available where having English is a bonus, most employers are going to want you to speak at least one Swiss language if not more.  And given the recent vote to curb immigration to Switzerland there's more reluctance to hire someone who doesn't already have a Swiss permit allowing them to work here.   
Here's a couple of websites although I don't know if they'll be of any use to you:         
Good luck.

			Hi 
I'd like to get the views from the forum on a potential (small) business idea...   
My wife is a senior HR professional. English graduate, MBA from Paris, german speaker and currently working as an english teacher/translator (at the same time as full time mum).   
She possesses a fantastic skill to write/tailor CV's for people (mostly in english). She has started rewriting CV's for many friends and more and more people ask for her help. I'm also a HRD covering >20,000 people, so know what is & isn't a good CV (Ok I'm also biased...).   
I suggested she set up an online business doing it commercially as she has a clear skill but of course, we need to know if there is a market for it.    
Do you think there could be a market for this in Switzerland and if so, how much do you think is a reasonable amount to pay for a tailor made CV?   
Any advice would bve really helpful as its just an idea at this stage...   
Many thanks,

There was no German language requirement.  I also made my application in English, and stated that my German skills were basic (though my Swiss German is fairly good).   
I heard back today for an interview, but this communication was in German.  I also asked if I should prepare for the interview in German or English and I was told the interview would be in German but my English might be tested.  I am not afraid to ask if I can explain myself in English at times, and this isn't my first German interview.   
I was wondering if there might be someone who would be willing to help me practice an interview in German.  Preferably someone with an engineering background to help me with technical words and ask some technical questions.

			Hi Dorado, welcome to the forum. Congratulations on your job offer and good luck with working out the finer details and making your choice.   
I came to Switzerland for 2 years to work as a research staff. Im actually in my mid 20s, which is probably on the other side of the age spectrum you were looking for, but Ill try my best to generalize some aspects. With that in mind, Ive been really fortunate to call my job an incredibly rewarding experience from day one. My research group is quite active in terms of publishing papers and attending conferences and so I have an opportunity to work on a well-defined project and keep my eyes on the bottom line. Sure, there are differences between Swiss and American academic cultures (or any other national cultures) but I can only speak highly of my experience in Switzerland.   
Here are some pros and cons, which I find, of being employed in academia in Switzerland.   
PROS: 
- Relaxed and comfortable atmosphere (yet still time-efficient ways of doing things) 
- Good chance of striking the right work-life balance 
- Great coworkers (genuinely nice, candid, and resourceful)   
CONS: 
- No issue that jumps out   
Hopefully, some of this is relatable to your situation. Yet, at the end of the day its still about making a decision that feels right for you. With that in mind, have you had a chance to stay in the area for a few days? Or perhaps chat with your potential coworkers about the nature of the job, what they like or what they would change about it, or about any other insights as you see fit?    
Good luck and let us know how youre doing. Hope you find enough resources and pick the alternative thats best for you.

Mmm Interesting, a first for me that someone thinks I am spreading spam or posting commercial emails. Unfortunately no cigar this time for you :-) however you are right that this is my first post on this site.  I am brand new to Switzerland and enjoying every moment so far. Normally I live in the SDN space ( ).  Massive amount of information related to SAP and well visited by all SAPPERS however completely unknown and irrelevant to all those outside the SAP world.   
As is in the computer world most of the recruiting happens via the telephone and email and except for one or two occasions I have never met the recruiters face to face.  Often we would not even be based in the same country!  The personal approach by the SCC was for me a very welcome change and a good experience.   
Hope that you will also have a positive experience when you engage with the SCC.

I have an european bacherol (portuguese bacherol) in Multimedia, but I went to university with 25 years and finished it with 28, then I worked as a computer science teacher at one secondary school in Portugal, but with the ""crisis"" I got unemployed as a lot of my age colleges. Since then I have worked in others jobs. Then I came to Switzerland, I only got a job as housekeeping in a hotel. I want to find another thing to do, because that's not what I fought for and this job do not aloud me to learn german, because all of we are the same mother language.     
I know that with my age (31) I should have a lot of experience, but I don't, and I feel I'm forgeting what I've learned, because my work it's hard and when I get home I feel too tired to study. 
I have made 3 months intensive german course A1, but I feel my german it's really poor for market requirements.   
I really love what I have studied, and I do not want to stop dreaming in finding a job in what I love to do, so...any advice it's welcome!

1538	Employment	Moving to Zurich in March, need a job but don't speak German at all	Nickodemio	4409	22	Zurich	16.01.2014, 22:19	"    Less German language in the Swiss German area of Switzerland, where most of the cooks are Germans...right. Since service, which is high paced and very communicative, is only done in German, how is it that under stress, a native German speaker, will fall into English? Making an exception, when after that one trial day, that German chef doesn't decide to take a native speaker instead?     
I think spouses that get hired to come to Switzerland tell their trailing spouses this kind of info to get them to come, because someone in HR told them that, who also does not know.      
BOH service has to always be done in the language that is native to the majority of the people on the line. In Zurich it is Swiss German/Hoch Deutsch, in Neuchatel it French, in Detroit it is Spanish. I worked in several kitchens in Detroit where I had to learn Spanish to be able to lead the teams because almost no one spoke English. And it is no different here.     
I am not trying to be discouraging, I am trying to say anyone that knows how to cook, is better to adapt then people in most fields, and this is no different. Learning kitchen lingo is the key. Just like in the states, there is kitchen lingo, that the even the average American, non kitchen worker never understands. So this is no difference.      
Being able to speak French in ZH or surrounding cantons is of zero use. Don't bring it up in an interview, even if the restaurant is a so-called French or Mediterranean restaurant. Odds are it is what is says on the menu or the website, and there is about 5 to 10% of actual French or Med references. I have worked for 3 German Chefs, that were head Chefs of ""French"" restaurants here in Switzerland and they knew, and I feel I have to say it this way, d%ck about what French food was. Nor did they care.      
Ignore also work/temp agencies.      
Suggestions...try the Hiltl...they have every nationality in the book working there. And even though they stress knowing excellent German, they also expect you to know English. I have known several Americans to work there, and they all say English is what they speak most of the time. Apply there, promise you are learning German an X school, and you love the language, sound like you are motivated. They are always hiring people because it is a very busy place and always burning thru staff.            
Do not apply to Clouds Gastro unless you like wasting your time. They are burning thru staff for all the wrong reasons. Totally dis organized.     
Learning German really isn't the most important thing, it is the 2nd most important thing. What you should do is apply to hotels directly, and tell them you are wanting to make a, I will get back to you for this word in German, but like a viewing. People do this all the time, Swiss people, in Switzerland when they are young, or older and want to possibly change careers. You ask, say a hotel, to work for free for a week or two. You work 1 to 3 days in each position in the hotel, HR, reception, Kitchen, housekeeping, etc. They give you something to eat, and normally are ridiculously friendly. This way you get a feel for how they work here, their lingo, what they expect, and so on, then you use it towards your interviews and trial days to look more experience, in the Swiss way, then you are.      
If you pm me, I can ask around if anyone is hiring, and go from there. If it is just you worked the frypit at the chicken shack back home and think Rösti flipping should be no different...then it will be a bit more of a challenge.

1541	Employment	Salary docked for late timesheets ...is it Legal?	meebo	2679	10	Zurich	11.03.2014, 18:44	"    Theoretically, if the employer is barred from billing the client because of lack of timesheets, he suffers damages for which he could set-off these damages against your salary... however, only to the extent that this amount is subject to attachment (""pfändbar""), cf. Art 323b CO  However, if the billing of the clients is not affected, this route is not open to the employer (where is the loss).   
The other route is for the employer to claim that you have not worked, and accordingly that he does not owe any salary/pay. However, I assume that you can show that you have actually been with a client so simply handing in the time sheets late should not be an issue...

			Hi all,   
Just looking for some advice, in contract negotiations at the min, recruitment agency is offering 430chf a day for support position in bank, I have been offered the job, no contract yet but it is being prepared   
Some questions:   
Does the recruiter negotiate on my behalf for a rate? I didn't think this was the case, i figured the rate is set by the client (a major bank) the negotiation is between myself and the agency, is this correct?   
I believe the rate to be too low, the role is a support position (not basic troubleshooting), in general if the role is in Zurich what is a an acceptable daily rate, 475-490chf? can you give examples of how you would gauge your market rate, several years experience, masters degree etc.    
On average what can I expect in terms of deductions tax etc. would 30% overall be accurate?   
Generally I feel the recruiter is playing on my lack of experience in contract negotiations, all advice is welcome, I'm not based in Switzerland yet but hoping to move immediately having found a job I like and a good working environment etc. but I don't want to be taken advatage of so all advice is welcome.

welcome to the forum! Perhaps your financial situation would allow you to start some unpaid internship. That would be a chance to entry job market at some big international company. Just an idea I am brainstorming...      
I am new in Switzerland and unemployed myself so far, even with local language skills

1545	Employment	Possible to take a freelance job while keeping the main employment	RandomForest	1705	13	Lausanne	07.03.2014, 13:08	"    Thanks for the advice. I work on a contract with fixed 42 hrs/week and a fixed salary. However due to the nature of the work it is ""task based"", which means that we are assigned a set of tasks every week. For me I usually take far less time to finish my job and in the same time I can even help others on their projects. And because of this the manager is quite happy with me and he specially allows me to leave earlier every day. I actually stay in my office working for 30-35 hrs per week and with long coffee breaks and this does not affect the quantity and quality of my work. This is also why I think I am capable to take on this additional freelance work at home.   
On the other hand an immediate salary rise is not possible as we are a large bureaucratic institution with each post exactly the same salary for everyone. Next promotion takes time.    
Sometimes the manager does ask me if I can do a little more. He makes it very  polite. Sometimes I say yes (when my own load is quite light) but otherwise I say no. I feel I am not obliged because I get the same salary as the others and I already produce more (the fact that I actually work for a shorter time is not relevant, as I could slow down my work to match the time and product as the others). He is not upset. I know that for the moment I am indispensable and he does not want to make us feel unhappy and then I leave.   
So, I do not know what will be his attitude after learning that I wanna do an additional job. On one hand, I think he is confident that it will not affect my main job. On the other hand, he already did me a favor in being very flexible with me. Also it might become harder to turn down his request in the future...

If you work in Switzerland and pay into the Swiss system and are eligible for Swiss unemployment then you move to the EU/etc, you will collect Swiss unemployment at the Swiss rate for three months in that new country. Passport is not relevant only that you are legally resident in that new country.     
In the case of the OP, he will be paying into the UK system. So if he leaves the UK and returns to Switzerland, he will be eligible* for UK unemployment benefits which he can get paid out in any of the countries that are in the agreement. Currently that includes Switzerland. But he will be given the amount he would get from the UK.    
(*we assume, not sure what the rules are for the UK. Maybe quitting your jobs does not qualify there)

This, unfortunately, is a problem with having a BFA and choosing a very narrow career band- few opportunities in the corporate world.    
That said, can he find any sort of remote work that would allow him to live in CH and work wherever? That might be possible, if he can find an employer that can funnel regular work his way, or his current client base would accept working with him online.

I tried finding a job ahead of time for the purposes of feeling more secure in my decision, day in and day out for about 8 months, to no avail. I eventually decided that getting over there and networking was the only way to do it. Super annoying, I know, but after months of hard work and job applications, I genuinely think its the only way to go.

The comment about the timing is related to people cutting the timing too close (assuming that the post office will deliver tomorrow AND the person will be there to receive it). Hence my point about giving it a couple more days. If the letter is not picked up the first day, the regulations assume it is received the next day. This can still screw you up on the timing (and in most cases add another month to your notice period).

			That's the spirit! Your English is excellent by the way, so make sure it says so on your CV!    
I know it may not be ideal but Ikea are always looking for people, and they welcome people with language skills. At this stage, your main obstacle is getting a job, any job. Swiss experience is invaluable and Swiss employers want to see that on a CV. Once you get that first permanent job, things will start to fall into place. Have you thought of volunteering? This again can open doors AND looks good on the old CV.    
Anyway. You've made it this far, so don't give up. Get out to some forum events if you can. It's a good way to meet people for one and they can offer great advice based on their own experiences. There are a lot of people who have settled here the hard way, so meeting them helps. It helped me in the beginning.

You may also want to check out El Camino at the Muhleplatz in Thun (Martin (Tinu) is the owner). Lots of english speakers and people travelling through that could possibly help out. The Clock Tower on the Ob. Hauptgasse also has english speakers that might be able to point you in the right directions work-wise.

You are not in fact unemployed, so you are not the responsibility of the RAV.  If you are ill during the notice period and are unable to look for employment then the notice period is suspended and you are entitled whatever sick pay the employer offers, which seems to be what has happened in your case.  I suppose strictly speaking you are still an employee of that company and perhaps they need to handle the permit situation.  I think you really need to get proper legal advice, because it is not a common situation.

			It is hard nowadays even in s/w development (a niche one), and yes, the stars must often align. I spent two fascinating years at a cool but cash-strapped startup before I got one and only one offer somewhere else, and I was far from 40 at that time.   
Nowadays sending CVs is very easy and costs time only, so I guess each reasonable job post gets hundreds of replies from all over the country and abroad. I advise replying to anything that resembles the skills and interests, as there is a lot of stupid chance involved, simply to increase the odds of hitting interest somewhere. 
My impact cross section is about one interview per 100 of (semi)bespoke applications (and not same generic CV mass mailed to anything that moves).

			There aren't any rules that would prevent a future employer from contacting your current employer.   
However, I do know of some people in your position, and they managed to find new positions without letters from their PhD advisors (usually getting colleagues or other faculty members to act as their references).  Obviously, it will come up in the interview process and you'll have to explain why you'd rather not have a future employer contact your present employer.   
Now for the good news:  If you're on a limited time contract (most students are on a yearly contract), your boss needs to have extraordinary measures to break that contract.  You looking for a new position is not enough to ""fire you.""   
And the bad:  You are also bound by that contract and your boss will need to agree to release you before the termination date.   
Bottom line:  you're probably better off talking to your boss about finding a new solution-either a new PhD advisor (and this happens far more frequently than you might think) or a job.

Yes BUT you pay a different tax rate if you only worked a few months and the rest you were not working than if you work the full 12 months simply because your annual income will be lower.     
Few people know this and the tax authorities do not like it when you try to push this but it is the right way.

			People are being a bit harsh with you in this thread. But they're also giving some good advice.   
If you are hired for a junior role, you will hopefully be trained in some manner. This might be formal (professional training) or informal (learning the business by shadowing someone). So don't worry too much.   
The worst thing that can happen to you is that they leave you sitting in a corner with nothing to do. This makes the days boring and long.   
As someone else said, even if you are given boring/mundane tasks, do them to the very best of your ability. Do them with a smile. Establish a reputation as someone who is reliable, competent and pleasant to be around. Then good things will come your way over time.   
If you don't know how to do something, figure it out. Google is your friend. Try to figure it out yourself first,  ask questions. Do say ""I haven't done this before, but I'm sure I can figure it out."". Don't say ""I don't know how to do this. Can you give the task to someone else?""      With regards to your specific question about business planning...   
Nobody expects you to ""cut-and-paste"" from a book. A book should tell you  to develop a business plan. At some point, you might be expected to play a role in a team that will follow those guidelines to develop a business plan for a client.    
For example, an early step in developing a business plan is understanding the business in its current state. So you might be provided with raw data about business sales and expenses and asked to collate that data into something meaningful, such as which products generate the most sales, which products have the highest profit margin, etc.   
Another step in developing a business plan is identifying areas for growth. So you might be asked to research new innovations or customer trends in a particular area relevant to the client's business.    
Again - it is an entry level position, so you will probably be given clearly defined tasks to do, as part of a team, which are within scope of your knowledge and skill-set. So don't freak out.

1608	Employment	Confirmation about stay in Switzerland less than 5 years	Anastasiia	1271	12	Germany	28.01.2014, 18:23	"    In my opinion it is 3 factors:    
1. Germany is much bigger, while many Swiss see themselves as a small nation that will easily lose its identity if it accepts too many foreigners.  
2. Germany, even if after the 2008 crisis emerged as a strong economy, has still a far lower percentage of expats than Switzerland (it received big numbers of emigrants in the West part in the 60's and 70's, but after the reunification and until recently very few people moved there). Switzerland has had a steady inflow for more than a decade. 
3. Germany does not offer its citizens the possibility to call a referendum about any issue, thus such decisions are taken with a far more technocratic approach. Swiss politicians know that accepting every E.U. citizen is already pushing the tolerance of the average Swiss voter, so they have put in place so many rules and conditions for non-EU people to avoid a referendum with an unpredictable outcome.

			Sorry, never heard if it, but that does not matter.....   
What does matter is if it has an MRA with the main European bodies or is recognised by the EU as a professional accounting qualification.  And as far as I can see there is no comment on their website... having members in every country does not really matter one way or the other....   
Furthermore they are not listed as being member of IFA or recognised by the FEE, so it is going to be hard to convince someone that has no knowledge of your organisation, that it is up to the grade.   
By contrast the CICA has agreements with at least:   
-  
-  
-    
Members of these three bodies are fully recognised all over Europe, so swapping a CICA qualification for a European recognised one is an easy way forward.

			Just posting a quick update after we actually had an hour with a lawyer specialized in labor law and conflict resolution:    
Advice given:  
- DO NOT under any circumstances agree to earlier than the contractually agreed termination notice. The unemployment office does not appreciate people waiving their right to remuneration and results in penalty of 3 months on the unemployment benefits. 
- DO meet employer and officially provide notice of termination within 3 months 
- DO NOT quote medical reasons in termination letter (will affect the reference letter) 
- DO immediately request an interim and final reference letters and review both with lawyer for language (must be positive and include words like ""entirely satisfied"", performed very well, etc) 
- as soon as notification letter is handed in, notify unemployment bureau that as of dateX person will be unemployed; notification should be accompanied by letter from doctor stating medical reasons;    
Until the doctor deems my wife fully capable to resume full time employment, her benefits will be paid by the canton of residence and not the unemployment office - this waives the need to report on a monthly basis how many applications have been submitted and the likes. This is limited to 24 months in time, after which the canton requires full medical checkup to qualify person's (dis)ability to work and categorization of illness.    
WHEN the doctor deems my wife fit to resume, (s)he will send letter to the unemployment office + canton stating his/her opinion. This triggers the transfer of benefits from canton to unemployment office - these may last a maximum of 24 months and require active participation from wife: seeking jobs, applying, monthly interviews at the bureau, etc.   
Hope this is of help to those who researching similar issues. Equally so, I hope none of you readers end up in burnout scenarios. All the best   "	445	 Jul 2008	4	['3', '3']	['352', '134']	5

Make it clear you are very grateful for the opportunity in Frankfurt but make it sound as if you are inquiring if long term career prospects would be better in London and / or Zurich, and, as you already have some experience in Frankfurt, what are the possibilities of getting experience in the company in a different location.   
What would your status be in each of those three places ? Would you be classified as an expat in one or more, and would that bring you more in allowances etc ?

Ask them what they do if the end client doesn't pay on time. I.e. do they have a dunning process, and will they pursue non-payment through the courts.    
The problem is that it's only the fee that's at risk for them (and a bit of cashflow), so they've little incentive to chase non-payment properly.   
If you have good clients, it's not a problem of course - but do credit check your clients as well!

Always apply directly first if possible. If you don't get a response and still want an interview, wait a while and then try via an agency. Sometimes the art of persuasion can be beneficial.

However, maybe rather than getting him in trouble, you can as you say get just cause for quitting your job if you can show evidence of other times that may constitute unfair treatment etc.      A look through your post history confirms you are an aggressively posting troll.

			On the job side, it's not a problem being American as well unless you're likely to have signatory rights on any business accounts; that would put you out of the running for the job because   accounts you have power over in any way have to be reported to the IRS on a FBAR form.  It doesn't matter if they're yours or the business's, if you have signatory rights they have to be reported.  Which obviously doesn't please the companies very much so they'll no longer hire Americans for those positions.   
Otherwise, it's the banking side that's going to be the problem.  Provided you're willing to sign a W-9 to allow your new bank to pass your account info on to the IRS you should be able to get a basic salary account.  If not, you won't get an account at all.  UBS, Credit Suisse, PostFinance and the cantonal banks of Zurich and Basel seem to be the only banks still taking on American clients.   
Does your bank in Germany know you're also American?  If not, you'd better tell them and see what they need from you to keep your account.  FATCA applies to all banks worldwide and if you're not prepared to let the banks pass on your info and you're not US tax compliant FATCA requires the banks to close your accounts.

I'm not sure that any multiple choice practice exams are available for IPMA, and you have in addition to undergo a written, oral and project work with defense of your project work to pass the examination. All said both have their merits and demerits. Myself, being IPMA have the personal opinion that IPMA has an overall (personal) approach, as opposed to PMP which is just multiple choice (i.e. get your facts right). No idea about Prince II.

			Thanks but i already had the case presentation and i completely bombed it. Reason being it was an insanely technical case study with lots of quantitative information in an an area i have absoloutely no experience in. I basically ended up giving a presentstion on a mostly un related topic wihile trying desperatley to make some connection to the case.    
After giving the presentation i felt certain that there was no way in hell i would be considered for this job anymore but after speaking to one of the interviewers he explained to me that the intent of the case was not solving it or having a right answer and in fact most other canditates will have no idea how to evaluate the technical data that was given.    
So to me it seems sometimes these case studies want to see how you respond to unfamiliar information and you deal with just being thrown into the deep end.

My wife has been offered a new job in Vaud area and we both will be moving in a couple of months. We are both EU nationals.   
Mi idea is keep working for my current employer as tele commuter and travelling to my home country one week a month. I was wondering if any of you know where I should pay taxes (Swiss tax are lower than my homeland's) and in case I could pay taxes in CH how I should proceed (my wife will be taxed at source).    
On the other hand, does anyone of you know how to proceed with regards to health care and social security contributions? I would not like to pay twice for healthcare (once in my home country directly deducter by my employer and once again in CH the mandatory insurance)   
Thanks in advance for your help

Edit: Conversely, I have seen examples of non-EUs on this forum getting permit extensions based on RAV after working for years on non-student B permits. So the problem seems to be universities employing people who arent studying on ""student"" permits.

			I can't comment on everything, just on the US finance aspect of your quandary.   
If you manage to keep your Swiss accounts, you just keep filing your US taxes and the FBAR form, once the combined value of non-US accounts is over $10,000. It's not rocket science. It takes time to fill out the forms, but if you do so, you will be compliant.   
There are many US citizens and green card holders living in Switzerland. They are managing, and while I think you should inform yourself of your US obligations while you're in Switzerland, don't get scared off by these.

1682	Employment	Minimum wage for house personnel is raised by 1.8%	Sbrinz	1435	4	Murten - Morat	02.12.2013, 02:25	"     Normally I get a sheet sent to me by Hotella(The Hospitality Union), that shows all of that when I exit an operation. I don't know about wide spreading cheating employees. But I assume it happens far more often to cleaners and childcare providers, especially via expats.   
I say this, because if you want these services normally you get registered to local offices and fill out a ton of paperwork, and normally wait forever before they find someone qualified. Then it is expensive. So much so it almost outweighs the benefits of going to work, instead of minding your own children yourself. And also while there is offering of jobs in childcare under the table, there rarely is in the restaurant business.    
Then again if you take work without proper paperwork you do it at your own risk. I am only going on about this because I haven't ever heard of employers pocketing AHV benefits before, and that is easily traceable to find out if they violated that agreement. Which is normally deducted with each salary. The people are the AHV are Swiss mind you, so they are constantly poking their noses around to this kind of activity.    
And more importantly, the fine and trouble they would get in, is so much more then pocketing this trivial amount.

			You have the same problem as your spouse had, everyone else in Switzerland is ahead of you in the job queue.  Also if you're here on a short term, i.e. 2 years or less, then employers may not be willing to go through the hassle of trying to get your permit changed to allow you to work.  This is what any employer has to do to be able to hire you:       
Time consuming and expensive, so unless your skills/experience are outstanding it's going to be very difficult.  Not impossible, just difficult.   
Also what Swiss languages do you speak?  Although English is used a lot in IT jobs here, having a Swiss language too will put another candidate in front of you if everything else is equal.

A ""patent attorney"" in most places implies a technical qualification + training in IP law, generally leading to a qualifying examination, such as the EQE. However, in the USA (also South Africa), a patent attorney must have a law degree (otherwise s/he is a ""patent agent""). The following uses ""lawyer"" in the European sense.   
First of all, become a lawyer (i.e., obtain a law degree)! These days, more and more universities are running courses in intellectual property law, and you could do these. Patent law will always be heavier going for a lawyer with no technical qualification, because of the technical nature of the subject matter, but any lawyer can tackle the other aspects of IP (copyright, designs, trade marks, confidential information and trade secrets...).

			And you can get good doctors on just the basic insurance too. Where the distinction kicks in is in hospital care. If most of what you require is outpatient then you may have the same doctors for many things as patients with supplemental insurance. All my doctors (gyn, oncologist, orthopedist) will operate/treat me in hospital, given that I go to a given hospital. For an emergency. It might be different. And in some cases you can pay the difference between basic and private.

			Hello,   
I am a recent graduate in Mechanical Engineering and plan to move to Switzerland.  I am a Swiss citizen but have lived most of my life in the US.  I have tried to search for a job in CH from the US but I am having a difficult time.  I will be going to CH for Christmas to visit family and am planning on staying there to search for an engineering job.  I am worried about finances though and am considering searching for a part time job maybe just at a store or restaurant in the mean time.     
Will employers see this as a negative on my resume if I come from an engineering internship into a part time position?  I worry that it will seem like I am not qualified to find any engineering jobs.   
Also, if I find an engineering job, how much notice would I have to give notice at a store job?  I know in the US two weeks is sufficient time but I am not sure what the proper practices in Switzerland are.   
Thanks!

Let me first tell someting about myself: 
I am Civil engineer from EU country and this month I am at my familly (St. Gallen Kanton) - I am searching for a job in construction area.  
After few calls to some companies ( for example Implenia) I noticed that very important is that you know very good german language. I only know basic and I am willing to improve my skills in next months. I am aware that if you wanna work on the construction site here in Switzerland that is very important that you communicate with workers.  
Is anyone here with experience on that field - finding a job in construction area ? 
I also made a contact with temporär büro for bau - but they are not usally working with engineers. I don´t even know if this temporär is good thing or not ( I mean I am prepared to work in the begining on lower position than as engineer)

			Hi again, 
I got some formal answers to my questions and I thought to let you know this important Information:   
1. Public Holidays during maternity leave are included in the 14 weeks. 
2. C-Section does not prolong the maternity leave period. 
3. In order to get 80% salary during the 14 weeks, the mother has to work at least 5 months   must have an AHV insurance for at least 9 months.  
In Switzerland, your AHV insurance starts according to the date written on the permit. 
4. A mother who goes back to work while breastfeeding must get 50% of the time it takes her to breastfeed as working time. 
For example- If it takes an hour to go home, breastfeed and come back to work, then half an our should be counted as working time.   
If I find out anything else I'll let you all know.

			I am a 30-year-old freelance web designer and front-end developer living in Bern.   
Not enough direct human contact during the week and too much time spent at home are starting to affect my wellbeing. To balance things out I've decided to look for part-time work which would allow me to continue freelancing.   
Ideally the work would require some level of physical activity (i.e. not sitting all day) and provide a chance to practice my limited German.   
This summer I worked for one of the big open air festivals and loved it. I worked outside and moved all day, picked up a couple of new skills, met some great people, and got to see everything that is involved in making something like that happen. It's pretty remarkable.   
Because I've been freelancing since a young age, or otherwise employed full-time, my experience with this sort of work is very limited. However, I'm a quick learner and open to try almost anything!   
Any suggestions for what to look for and where?

1729	Employment	Looking (rather desperately) for a job in the Lausanne area	LouiseWulff	1646	6	Lausanne, Vaud	13.11.2013, 12:29	"    I have not put enough effort into LinkedIn to have it really work for me, but I am not looking for a job. Have you joined groups on LinkedIn and posted queries or responded to other discussion threads? There is   I joined earlier in the year that leads you through a lot of things to do to improve your LinkedIn presence and to use it for networking. I know the group owner is starting the process again in December, but a lot of the recommendations are available in a report. This group may be focused on entrepreneurs more than people looking for jobs, but if you contact the owner, she may be able to point you to the right sources. If you start contacting people for information and help in smaller ways, that may help you get over feeling pushy.   
While you are looking for the right opportunity, I'd join every expat social and professional organization, I could find and just try to widen the circle of people I knew. And be sure to join local Facebook groups.   
Build your own website or find a local organization that needs help with theirs, or with their social media strategy. You'd have to work on a volunteer basis but you could build contacts and gain some experience.

Seems strange to me that it would change cantons so quickly, even if it was in temporary premises. Are there any forum members working there? It will be interesting to see how many of the staff choose to move to Zug.

			What do you want us to say?  That you're right, all Swiss companies have horrible HR/recruitment practices, they're discriminatory, and now that you've finally brought it to light, everything will change and get better?    
Job hunting sucks, as anyone who has ever looked for a job can tell you.  But you just have to keep plugging away at it.     
I understand the initial frustration, but to keep going on and on about how her lack of a job is someone else's fault seems to hint at a sense of entitlement...and frankly, for those of us who are on the job hunt and are NOT blaming our lack of success on other people, it's kind of annoying.

			Hi there.    
I have the following question - I have worked in Geneva for 6 years until February 2013, when I was transferred back to the US by the Company.    
I have C permit which was ""suspended"" by OCP until 2017.   
I have stopped working in September 2013.    
If I return to Switzerland, and re-activate my C permit - will I be eligible for chomage? 
I have worked for 12 months in the past 24 months, but I haven't worked in Switzerland or EU for the last 6 months prior to applying for unemployment benefits.    
Any thoughts? 
Thanks in advance.

			I won't have managed 12 months in the 24 month period. As I understand it I simply fall off the RAVs radar once the 24 months is up.   
I am assuming I get no help unless I am destitute - and I can, if needs must, call upon savings or even bring a pension entitlement forward. However my preference is to continue to find work, even if it is not regular.   
However I am also thinking seriously of moving abroad, either because the state provision is better or because I am more likely to find work.

1738	Employment	Married, spouse works full time, am I still entitled to unemployment benefits?	xyz20	4682	6	Zurich	11.05.2009, 08:46	"    Unemployment insurance ALV has nothing to do with taxes. Nor is it connected with AHV except that it is collected at the same time. But ALV is contributed to the unemployment fund.   
When your wife has paid 12 months ALV premiums (within the preceding 24 months) then she is entitled to unemployment benefits.    
Has you wife worked previously in a EU country? Premiums paid in a EU country would count for CH entitlement.   
Qualifications and language skills are irrelevant for determining unemployment benefits. It is simple: pay premiums, get benefits.

In larger companies with big HRs, it is a waste to send thanking mail etc as the HRs are very process oriented rather than being personal.It might also come across being too pushy if the company is very Swiss and take sometime in the decision making.   
You can generally gauge the kind of company culture in the first round and following up after giving them sufficient time would be a good idea.

I understand that Chicago is good (Caveat: I've only visited and never worked there), but NY has virtually every bank on the planet there. If you can't get in via your internship, it may be easier to (as an earlier post mentioned) get in with a local bank in CH and then do a transfer, maybe even via London (Hey, sounds familiar!)   
New York has a seriously high bar, however. It's extremely competitive and VERY unforgiving, but the rewards are also very high. Perseverance and obstinence will get you much further than anything else. If you want it bad enough, refuse to take ""no"" for an answer. It will be hard, especially with just an internship under your belt, but it won't be impossible.

1775	Employment	Will my wife get unemployment benefit?	bravoawan	1403	5	bern	27.10.2013, 19:30	" 
			
			My understanding is that the maternity leave (and sick leave prior to the birth of the baby when the doctor writes a certificate) - is entitled even if you give notice to not return after the birth of the baby.   
Personally, for professional reasons, and out of respect for the employer, I would do this rather than not give notice until after the maternity leave.   
If you do not give notice before the maternity leave, the employer cannot sever the contract except under very extenuating circumstances, but they can ask you to come to work at a reasonable time (maybe between 6-12 weeks after the birth) for a meeting to discuss your return to work.    
If she wants to take 6-12-18 months off work and then go looking for a new job, then she will get the paid maternity leave and then spend time being at home and then go to RAV when she is ready to look for a job. There is a very strict requirement to have childcare lined up - that means either someone within the family who is available to care for the child at short notice, or a place already booked and confirmed in a childcare centre.    
It is also possible to go on 'part-time' unemployment - that means you are looking for a job with particular hours (50%, 80% etc) and the RAV will pay you the lower unemployment amount, based on the percentage that you are looking for. But it still means you have to jump through all the hoops to prove that you are serious about finding a job, and have childcare already organised for the child.  That means being available for appointments/interviews at the RAV and doing interviews with potential employers, whenever necessary, and having the childcare lined up already.

Anything can happen at sea, and it looks to me like we will head to test the 1.90 again, but calling CHF/GBP @ 2:1 anytime soon seems way too bullish.   
If you take the job I would ship as much spare cash as you can back to take advantage of the rates we are seeing at the moment, but fear of the exchange rate hitting 2 would be an awful reason not to take the job.   
YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF WITH CHF90K in Geneva than on GBP32k in London!!

			Hello, on this topic would like to share a recent experience that taught me there are risks involved in negotiating salary...   
Was offered a position (CEO of a small tech company in Romandie), when they sent me their proposed contract salary was lower than I expected. I asked for a meeting with the board members to go over salary + some other points. They agreed, I had the feeling the meeting went very well - I was tactful (or so I thought), they were open and I came out with +12k/year + moving costs+clearly defined bonus. At the end of the meeting we shook hands, agreed on starting date, etc...nothing to signal to me something had gone wrong.   
Couple of days later, I was waiting for the revised contract, I got an email saying they were cutting off discussions with me (i.e. revoking the offer). After speaking with them, the reason given is that they thought my expectations + ""ambitions"" were too excessive for such a small company, and I was not ""entrepreneurial"" enough in my attitude - I was pretty shocked, not to mention dissapointed because it was a sweet job...   
could be it was a one-off ""freak"" case, but thought I would put it out there...

			Hi,   
We are in a very similar situation (Both EU-17). The transfer date for my wife is June-2014 and I think (not fully sure) a B-permit is supposed to be automatically granted to me by then.   
The problem is that, as long as the permit is not active, there are few chances for me to get a job prior to her transfer date (due to the quota). In other words, a candidate who does not have the permit must be really worth the paperwork instead of hiring another one who already has it (or a local candidate).

Make sure the skills wanted for a particular position are foremost on your CV and make sure you send a motivation letter too, telling the company not only what interests you about the job, but what you can bring to the company as a whole.

			If you want to work in childcare then you really need a nursery nurse qualification and at least two years experience.  Even with that the wages are low and I would imagine you would find it hard to support you and your son.   
For English language teaching most places are looking for the CELTA qualification.  It would be very unlikely you would be accepted at a language school with only TEFL.  You will also find the language schools do not pay particularly well and initially you will find it difficult to get full time work.

But, firstly how long is your permit valid for?  Because as a student it's only going to allow you to work for 15 hours a week which isn't going to earn you much.  Also, if you're not going to continue with that course your permit may not be valid any more.   
You are allowed to look for full-time work as it says here:   
""Parliament passed the Neirynck initiative on June 18, 2010, a parliamentary initiative aimed at amending article 21 of the Foreign Nationals Act. The amendment provides for foreign nationals graduating from a Swiss university-level institution to be on an equal footing with Swiss nationals when it comes to entering the Swiss labor market. 
To find employment, foreign nationals who have earned a Swiss university-level diploma will be entitled to stay in Switzerland for six more months from the time of completing their education or postgraduate studies. Those who are successful in securing employment will be issued a work permit, provided the prospective position involves an activity of particular scientific or economic importance.""   
Secondly, have you been accepted by your university to do this new course in 2014?     
You really need to check with you canton migration office on what your status is here so you know the best way to proceed.

			If you are really committed to finding a full time job, then you should take small steps to show employers you are committed.  It can easily look like you intend to stay at home and have little to offer unless you take steps beyond just sending out CVs.   
--do you have childcare already lined up?  This could easily be a first interview question and instant stop.  It can take a long time to arrange daycare.  As you have language issues, perhaps already take the step to have childcare in place, and depending on budget give yourselft 1-3 months to do intensive language classes.   
--update skills or re-train.  It is clear that your CV likely needs some undusting.  Try to take classes, even a computer course, to show that you are updating your skills and are ready for the 2013 workplace.  This shows potential employers you are serious.  And even better yet if you take classes in an area where you plan to pursue career and have new skills.  Look at Migros, local university, etc..   
--network, get out and connect.  Try volunteering in a field you are interested in.  It will do many things, give you an idea if you like it, show employers you are serious, and gives you contacts and connections.

			In Switzerland if you can hire someone internally or through a referral; it keeps the cost of recruitment down for the company.   
It doesn't necessarily mean a family member or a friend, just someone who is suitable for the job, and may or may not be known to an existing employee of the company.   
Otherwise companies recruit through advertising the position via the media and/or agencies.   
Hiring someone you know either directly or indirectly is certainly not illegal anywhere in Europe, as far as I know.

I have a problem with finding ITIL course in English in Switzerland.  
Same I have with MCITP - I looked for it intensively for last few days, however, no useful results.  
Does anyone know the company offering these courses in Switzerland? Best region would be Fribourg/Bern/Lausanne

My point being I had searched online for jobs all over Switzerland prior to asking for more tips and opinions on exactly how active the fashion world was in (mainly) Geneva and found some options (my second interview with RL was going on, hence why I used it as an example) and was surprised when I got the negative feedback about there being no chances for me since I had already -after googling here and there- found a few jobs in the city!   Unfortunately this one requires me to move out of Geneve, but I'm lucky to have had some great job opportunities prior to moving, as well as speaking 5 languages that helped me land this job, but I have to admit luck was definately on my side!!    
So if any other fashion lovers are searching to work within the industry, don't give up the search! There are indeed vacancies within mode, as well as a surprisingly big amount of english speaking jobs!   "	5	 Sep 2013	0	['0', '0']	['1', '1']	0

			About signing - what you sign is a confirmation that you have received the notice. Not an acceptance of the notice. Since a notice is one way, there is nothing to accept and thus nothing to sign with this regards.    
This is perfectly normal practice and made so that it is clear to everybody at what date the notice was given. Many companies prefer this way instead of the impersonal way of giving notice by registered mail. If you refuse to sign, all that happens is that they call in a witness and also send a confirmation by registered mail.   
If requested, the employer has to state reason for the notice. But as others have said, as long as notice period is honored, reason wont influence the notice. It is still valid.

			Hi,   
I've noticed that in Switzerland (well worldwide probably) more and more people have fairly generic job titles. I know of two "" project managers"" one is a senior executive and another is ""just"" a regular office employee who has by default become the senior office employee because he has been with the company for more than ten years. He does not have any managerial responsibilities.   
In the near future I will be working closely with different people at ABB and was wondering if someone knew the general position levels/titles for their employees?   
Most larger corporations have a standardized system sooo any help would be appreciated. Also even more general do the Swiss have unwritten ""rules"" about academic and business titles? I know the Germans and Austrians can be sticklers about such things but it seems like the Swiss are more relaxed.     
Best regards,

Huge transformation going on and I know rows of people (management and staff) were recently released so sounds like a lot of re-adjustment for the new reality of banking world.

			thanks, was wondering about that, it is a KITA, our joint salary puts us in the highest bracket, but I wonder how they calculate when 1 party is unemployed, do they calculate on unemployent benifit, plus other salary ? 
my husbands is not such a high wage, and although I am not scared of financial hardship just yet, for me it was a shock to realise that you would still be expected to keep full time care even when unemployed. 
I am sure I will figure out something, maybe at least cut to half days, if he is attending kindergarten in the mornings, just another thing to add to my list. 
I have to look into everything, my tax allowance for a child is the general allowance, I was told there is no extra allowance for childcare, as this is what I ""choose"" that the amt given per child is the same with or without childcare.   
I am also contemplating setting up in business on my own, but I have to work this out too, can you claim benifits while setting up business ??

- International NGOs such as the Red Cross might be interested in your profile.

I am not sure if I can ask a question to a post in 2007 - but I will give it a try

That being said, it is very difficult to find a position in HR.

TEFL teaching in the UK is nearly always to multi-language classes, so speaking anything but English would be useless. A monoglot class does tempt teachers to break into the local language but this should be discouraged, although there are some great advantages knowing the local language as there many short cuts (much and many [uncountables and countables] can be a killer for French speakers, but the rule is exactly the same in High German [though not Swiss German] and so,  is 'much' and   is 'many' - also useful when learning German...

1) Lawyerd made no mention of %s. Paid doesn't imply Full Pay 
2) Lawyerd specially mentioned 9 months social contributions - which you then agree with. Lawyerd mentioned ""gainful"" employment - and not working - the 2 are different. Working would imply being the workplace. Gainful employment implies a contract of work - and not that it was carried out. The difference can be down to medical or unpaid leave 
3) Damn - can't find it at the moment - will check codes later. 
4) Lawyerd mentions being ""absent from work"" - this, from its reading, implies that the employee leaves the workplace to breastfeed. In the case of the child coming to the office this would not be the case.   
So you have actually just reiterated what Lawyerd already said.

			I would avoid any discussion of salary, and focus more on whether or not you are a fit for the position and the company.  I never provide one at the early stages until I know it is a possible fit.  I would not want to hire someone simply because they are cheaper.  I figure you get what you pay for.  And once both parties agree that it is a fit, then go through the process of determining the appropriate wage for you that is sustainable.  They will likely already have a budget in mind anyway.

			Sorry to hear your situation, I can only imagine how tough that is.   
I'm no legal/HR expert, but it's unlikely you will get sick leave on the basis that your dad is ill.   
You might be able to get a doctor to sign you off work if your stress and angst is severe enough to deem you unfit to work properly.   
Personally, I'd try your boss first. Ask for some compassionate leave. Offer to work remotely (as has been suggested). If you boss is such a tyrant that s/he won't offer a solution or to help, then sorry, but I'd tell him/her ""thanks, but the job's not worth that kind of attitude"".   
You might think you need the job, but the thing to remember is that you only get 1 dad. Go be with him!!!    
Hope it works out for you.

			Hi, 
 I did the Migros club when I went over at first. Good idea to build up your confidence and language skills .If hubby is working take the time to get to know the place, learn the language and get a job you really want. Many of the nurses I worked with only had GCSe level French so with a little extra tuition you should get by. Not saying its not hard initially ,you do go thro` a very steep learning curve , but most of my friends stayed until at least the end of their contracts. There are other language schools ofeering intensive courses - check link I gave you in other thread.

What's surprising is that you're getting the ringing even when using earplugs which should, if they are any good, be giving you at least 25db - 30db of attenuation.      should give you an idea of how long you can be exposed to a particular level of sound before hearing damage occurs. There are some SPL meters available for iOS and android which you could download. They're not particularly accurate, and on iOS at least limited to a max value of 100db, but they will give you an idea of the noise in your working environment.   
Basically anything over 80db continously has the potential to damage your hearing.

			If you employ someone over age 17, even occasionally just for a few hours, you are legally supposed to pay AHV employee contributions and show them a copy of your accident insurance for them working in your house (approx chf100 per year covers everyone, cleaners, babysitters etc, so worth having). Some more info in English is available on quitt.ch   
As above if they are self-employed then the obligation is on them, but it is quite hard to be self-employed in Switzerland e.g. cleaners who work for several households are considered employed by each separate household, unless they bring all their own cleaning materials, transport it all themselves, and have registered as self-employed.

I have befriended an HR person at one of the larger global firms in Zug and should be getting some feedback from them soon with respect to what my CV may be lacking.       
I think the trick for me will be to de-emphasize the ""title"" approach.  Perhaps I should reword that somehow?  Sure my companies before have called me ""Senior Project Manager""...but in some cases I would rather have had the title of ""Senior Administrative Assistant"".  After all, my career has more or less been to serve executives above me in a technical capacity.

The compulsory leave companies HAVE to give is 14 weeks (some cantons 16) and you cannot be called back to work earlier and they have to pay you 80% of your salary.   
If you want to go back earlier, then you can do so after 8 weeks, but for the first 8 weeks after birth it is not allowed for a mother to work.   
There is no legal paternity leave in CH.

1923	Employment	150,000 Canadian salary what to expect in Switzerland?	Canada2Swiss	9349	56	Canada	07.06.2013, 19:31	"    A bottle of coke can easily cost 4fr, from restaurant, newspaper stand at a train station etc. You buy it at a Migros or Coop (Supermarket/ Gas station) you are more in for 1.50.      Based on the job market, that would be a lowish salary for your skills, if it`s Glencore it should be a better salary than that. Even market salary that`s on the low end of the band.   
We moved from NY and I think cost wise it`s dollar for dollar. You will save LOADS in tax, rent will be more expensive, maybe 3,500+ (depends on size of apt/ location etc), healthcare could be a cost (maybe 800 per month), cars more expensive, groceries are a bit more expensive, meat is very much more expensive you have to figure out where to buy it, dining out is a lot more expensive for ""normal"" dine out, the fancy stuff is about the same. Factor in flight costs for visiting family how many times per year.   
I think an important part of your decision making will be local versus International school. International school or full time day care is 30k per kid per year.   
You have a nanny, does the wife work? If yes she will take home a lot of her salary as taxes will still be low even if the family income escalates. Full time nanny you might be in for 50k- 60k per year, all in.   
If the wife plans to work finding it may not be easy if she doesn`t speak German.   
Hope that helps.

			You will have a waiting period of unto 20 days, depending on salary, you also must prove you were actively searching for jobs for the last 3 months of your contract. If you only started looking & applied for 12 jobs in the final month expect a further 15 days penalty, the max penalty is 90 days.  
If your going to get a big penalty withdraw your application, as if you become unemployed again in the next 2 years that will be the basis of your future payout.   
So yes you are entitled to benefits, but possibly very little in your case at the end of the day.

1928	Employment	Salary Expectation at PSI for Research Associate	edge27	1906	0	Wettingen	26.07.2013, 19:57	" 
			
			Hello Everyone,    
Glad to find this English forum and I have already found some very useful information here   
Here is the thing: due to family reasons, I'm thinking about relocating to Switzerland in a few months. I just got an interview for a research associate position at PSI last week, and luckily I've got some positive feedback. They are scheduling another interview with me next week meeting meeting their HR, and I just have got a few questions as below:   
1. What type of questions do I expect in this type of meeting with HR?   
2. If they asked about my expected salary, how much I should suggest? Sorry I have never been to Switzerland before so I simply have no idea on this. As for myself, I have got a master degree in Engineering from a known university (but not in Switzerland), and I have got three years of consulting experience.   
3. Will they refer to my last drawn salary? This is something I'm a bit concerned about, as Swizerland has higher cost of living than the current country I'm staying now.    
4. I found out that PhD or PostDoc in Switzerland have some standard salary. But does it also apply to research position? or can be a reference for what I should expect? If it does, there is PhD 1-3 year, and PostDoc 1-3 year, which one should I refer to?   
Thanks for reading the post, hope that i can get this opportunity and be there to meet some of your guys in the future  "	21	 Jul 2013	1	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

			DELTA you can only take after having completed the CELTA and at least 2 or 3 years of actual teaching. Both courses are very intensive, but fantastic if you wish to teach English to adults. I did my CELTA in Spain and it cost 1,500€ for the four week intensive course. It's not cheap but then again it is cheaper than doing the course in Switzerland and it's real value for money. I'm also currently looking for more work in the Zürich/Winterthur area. I'm hoping that more opportunities will pop up as summer cools off, fingers crossed. Cheers!

1935	Employment	Moving to Zurich/Basel Switzerland	Barry30	1716	3	Dubai	07.07.2011, 00:15	"    Sorry Barry30, they may be sweet old ladies, but their facts are totally wrong.  As a non-EU or ""Third State"" citizen as the Swiss call them, you must have a firm job offer first before you can even come here.  The rule for getting that job is that any potential employer has to prove the Swiss authorities that they can't find a Swiss, EU national or someone else already living here with a valid work permit who could do the job.   
You definitely CANNOT work on a tourist visa as Eloy07 points out.  Nor would you be able to stay for longer than 3 months on a tourist visa, although you could look for a job while you were here - but you couldn't actually start work until the work permit was approved which could take months.   
This is the official Swiss Federation of Migration website:       
which has lots of info on Switzerland's entry policy for Third State nationals, visa requirements, etc, so I suggest you have a good read through, starting with the Legal Basis for Access to the Swiss Labor Market for Foreign Nationals so you understand how difficult it will be to get a position here.  There are also plenty of threads here under the Permits section about the difficulties in obtaining work for Third State nationals.   
What they were referring too - and still getting some things wrong - was that EU citizens can come to Switzerland to look for work and can do this for up to a year if they don't find something in the first 3 months.  They don't need tourist visas so that is erroneous.  The Swiss also will not let them stay if they don't have a job and their work permit expires or they don't find work within a year, they have to leave the country.     
The rules are different for EU citizens because of the Free Movement of People Agreement between the EU and Switzerland.  But even so, there are too many foreigners trying to get into the country and the Swiss have brought in some restrictions on EU nationals too to limit their numbers.

1948	Employment	"Daily rate for ""nannying"""	kifissiacat	1550	18	Zurich	15.07.2013, 14:55	"    Here is the UNiA official site, which mirror the government one. Please not this is the absolute minimum, so the higher rate quoted for someone with qualifications but no experience + statutory holiday pay works out at around 25.   
￼Legal minimum wage for domestic staff 
More and more families in Switzerland are employing do- mestic help – in some cases under highly precarious condi- tions of employment. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the unions, domestic staff will have statutory rights in future. With the coming into force of the Normal Employment Agreement (NEA) on 1 January 2011, all domestic staff in Switzerland are entitled to a statutory minimum wage. 
Am I entitled to the minimum wage as defined 
by the Normal Employment Agreement? 
All domestic staff working more than 5 hours a week in 
a private household are entitled to the minimum wage, regardless of whether their daily duties involve cleaning, washing, shopping, cooking, caring for children or assisting invalids or sick people. 
The NEA does not apply to persons who work less than 5 hours per week for the same employer. As a rule, however, their wages are higher than the NEA minimum. 
Gross minimum wage 
(excluding allowances for leave and paid public holidays): 
Unskilled with at least four years’ 
professional experience in housekeeping CHF 20.00/h 
The employer must deduct no more than CHF 990.– from the monthly wage for accommodation and food. 
Am I entitled to leave and public holidays? 
All domestic staff are entitled to at least four week’s leave 
a year, and in some cantons five weeks. If leave is not taken, they must be compensated at the following rates: 
n +8,33% of the gross hourly wage for 4 weeks’ leave, 
n +10,64% of the gross hourly wage for 5 weeks’ leave. 
The number of public holidays depends on cantonal regulations. If such holidays cannot be taken or time taken off in lieu, they must be compensated. For example, the wage supplement for nine public holidays is 3,59%. 
Sample calculation 
Minimum wage with allowance for leave and public holidays (provided these can neither be compensated as time off in lieu nor taken): 
￼ 
Gross wage, unskilled labour: CHF 18.20 
￼￼9 public holidays 19.72 x 1.0359 = CHF 20.42   
￼ 
Semi-skilled with Federal Certificate 
of Aptitude (EFZ) CHF 22.00/h 
+￼￼4 weeks’ leave

If you're going to be a translator, it's something that you've got to dedicate yourself to. You can't just dip in and out of it, else you won't get much work.

I work for an international global company with regional offices here, where the language is English. Again, any thoughts are much appreciated, thank you!  	12	 Dec 2011	1	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

			Dear Members   
In two weeks time from now I have a job interview. The topics I have present in interview is "" Welche Schwerpunkte aus meinem Studium möchte ich in die Arbeit der ausgeschriebenen Stelle einbringen "".    
Although my German language skills are good but still I would like to have some professional touch on presentation skills ( right choice of words etc.) for this topic.   
I am wondering could someone give me an advice to make an impressing presentation in German language on this topic. The job is for a physicist.    
I could cook for you a special Indian dinner (3 course menu  ) as a token of thanks.    
Please write me a personal message if you have some time from your schedule.   
Thanks

			Two things here.    
1. Although it is very common it is not an absolute requirement that your contract termination is till the end of the month. It is possible to have this from the day it is given.    
2. How much holiday entitlement do you have? Can you also take unpaid leave. This is often possible for the last week or two if requested.   
With this information you can calculate your last working day.      "	68	 Jun 2008	2	['41', '15']	['14', '9']	-5

			Firstly, it may depend on who HN contracts you to - they don't necessarily apply the same rules to contracts relating to different client companies. For example, they may take a 'cut' from the daily rate paid by the client, which historically has been between 4%-20% or so. With some clients they don't do this, but take a separate fee.   
However, you may expect to see the following deductions:   
Daily rate charged to client e.g. 1000 
Depending on client, maybe a fee to HN   0% - 20%   
Employers deductions (from your rate): 
       statutory deductions   ballpark  8.5% 
    pension contribution  5% - 10%   (depending on age, choice of pension options) 
   bank holiday / holiday accruals   12.5%   
Employees deductions (from your rate): 
   statutory deductions    ballpark 6% 
   pension contribution  5% - 10%   (depending on age, choice of pension options) 
   source  tax (depending on your situation)    0% - 20%       So, a lot of deductions.  However, the pension deductions are going to your pension, the holiday deductions are paid out when you take holidays and the source tax is your income tax prepayment.

However, some companies might include money toward the cost of health coverage (which you then arrange by yourself), and some companies might have deals with insurance companies to get a slightly reduced rate (5-15% off premiums).  Accident insurance, however, is covered by the employer (e.g., you fall on the ski slope - your employer's accident insurance would cover the costs).

			What nationality are you?  Swiss, EU nationals and then the rest of the world in that order for jobs so if you're non-EU I don't hold out much hope, especially if it's only for a month.  Employers have to justify why you would be better than anyone else before they could hire you.  The costs simply won't make it worth their while for such a short time.  Switzerland is very regulated on the jobs side, you can't just turn up and get employed here.   
Either plan for a ""proper"" holiday, exploring the countryside, sightseeing, etc, or think about holidaying somewhere else if you want to throw some sort of work/volunteering into the mix.

1992	Employment	Internship/Graduate positions in Banking	mularda	1277	3	UK	23.06.2013, 15:20	" 
			
			The Swiss recently brought in a quota limit for EU-17 nationals which may be affecting applicants from outside the country.  From others who've posted here recently looking for work from abroad, there seems to be a reluctance on the part of employers here to consider them.  The restrictions are meant to encourage them to look inside Switzerland first for employees so they are going to try and fill their positions with people who are already here.   
So the question is how much to you want to live/work here?  Because it may be that you have to move here to be able to get a foot in the door.  As I said, there are a lot of ex-bank employees looking for jobs and given the US's recent spat with the Swiss over banking secrecy there may be more people being made redundant in the future if the US goes through with it's threat to take many Swiss banks to court.

			Hope you don't mind me replying. I am the main course tutor on the CELTA course in Basel at academia Basel. We've been running courses (full time and part time) for 2 years now. I've certainly enjoyed them (although yes they are hard work - for us too!) and the people taking them have said they also enjoyed them too.   
We don't make outrageous promises like guaranteeing all our CELTA students will get a job with us - such promises when you scratch the surface never turn out to be as attractive or trustworthy as they may first appear    
However the poster who talked about employing people who do well and make a good impression on the course is spot on.   
On average we offer work to 4 candidates (on a full course of 12)    
In the 2 years we have been running we have offered a salaried position with teaching and admin duties to one candidate. And have employed a another teacher full time and offered financial support to help him in his plans to take his Diploma and become a teacher trainer in the future. We have employed countless other teachers from the course including 2 French teachers who did the CELTA with us (they were bi-lingual)   
We have schools in Basel, Zurich, Bern, Biel, Ticino, Visp, Lausanne and Luzern. Some are just developing and as things develop will need more and more teachers including ""main teachers"" who can hold roles of more responsibility.    
The full time course this summer will be a small one - the part time one in November is already looking over subscribed.

			I'll second Odile's comment about needing GPs in rural areas - where I live there is a desperate need, none of the local doctors are taking on new patients, one might need to wait months to see a doctor for any non-urgent illness.   
However, being a rural area, language skills are critical. I would imagine one would need fluency in standard German, and in all practicality an ability to at least understand Swiss German, as patients here generally only speak SG. Very little English is spoken in these small villages, and there is even sometimes resistance to standard German.    
A consultation here (in my small village, YMMV as always) is rather different from my experiences elsewhere - rather than relying on physical examination the consultation is purely a conversation. The GP does not ask many questions or direct the converstation, rather the patient tells his/her story - so language skill are indeed   important.   
The area of greatest need, where a non-EU doctor might have the best chance of acceptance, is also likely the area where, beyond any legal requirement, in all practicality one needs even more solid local language skills than one might need in a metro area.   
Wishing you all the best.

			Hi  
I am sorry I have offended anyone. My observation was largely limited to general public in my country. But my primary doubt was, if ETH and its degree are so much valued (which I believe, and you too), then would it be good enough to get a job in Swiss/EU or the USA after graduation. I am eager to know about this because after completion of my studies I need to work for some time to cover my educational debts.

			Hi Latos 
I am not really in the arts area, so will be difficult to give you an idea. Just bear in mind that in Zurich salaries are much  higher than London, sometimes double and so are the expenses. So if for example you were making 35 GBP in London expect to make about 70-100K CHF (just a guess) here. Then expect about 30% of that to go towards taxes, compulsory pension and various insrance schemes (accident etc). Your French and Italian skills may not neccesarily  give you a higher income but may make your CV standout compared to the rest.  Whatever you do, be persistent as well as  consistent and good luck!      "	1	 Jun 2013	0	['0', '0']	['2', '2']	0

And these ads were placed by multinationals and vetted by local HR. Needless to say the only reason for such 'requirements' was to get rid of handicapped applicants.        Maybe you being deaf raises a security concern for employers ? You stated that you applied for menial jobs. I can imagine a few jobs in the logistics sector where some warnings are done via an audio alarm (forklifts or trucks reversing etc.). Sometimes these are with a flashlight, sometimes they are not. 
Generally speaking some employers may also be concerned about disability-related absence from the job.

			Hello all!   
My name is Caitlin and I'm currently in search for a  job in Switzerland teaching English. I live in Texas and graduated this  last December with a B.A. in History from Texas Tech University. Since  then, I have just recently completed my Texas teaching certification as  of last week and am now on the hunt for my dream job. I speak German  fluently and Russian proficiently (thanks to my husband who is from  Moldova). I am also a mother of two children.    
My husband can get  a EU citizenship based on his grandma having lived in Romania, but that  would take a whole year to process (plus, many thousands of dollars to  travel and to pay for documents). So I am looking for an alternative way  for me to utilize my teaching certification and language background to  get a job in my dream location, Switzerland.    
I have read from  others on this forum that one must have a CELTA. But has anyone  successfully gotten a teaching job based on having a US state  certification? I am certified in ESL, History 8-12, and Generalist K-6.   
Any and all suggestions would be wonderful for me to get a job in Switzerland.    
Also,  if any of you have any suggestions on other countries that would accept  me willingly with my qualifications, or know of any place that is  hiring, I would appreciate the information.   
You see, my husband's  dream is to be a top 100 tennis player. And I promised that I would  make it happen this year and take the reign on finances. Living overseas  would allow my children and I to see him more often due to the  proximity of travel with tennis tournaments. That, in itself, is what is  propelling me to find a job overseas in a safe location.     
Please, any helpful suggestions would be wonderful.

			I agree that the OPs English has room for improvement but, to be fair the OP isn't (as far as I am aware) asking people on this forum to offer them a job... (if they are, then this thread is in the wrong section for starters). I'm sure that any potential employers will be able to decide for themselves if the OP's spoken and written English is of a suitable standard for the post offered. We all understand what he / she is trying to say.   
So going back to the OP's question of advice for job hunting... I think Odile makes an excellent point - the more information you give us, the better we can advise you.   
One other thought that crossed my mind is that you could look for jobs on free ad websites like   and  . In my own job search I have found these sites are more likely to have adverts for jobs which do not require any particular qualifications, unlike (paying) job websites where often the adverts require specific qualifications. However, one word of warning - check the original date of the advert before applying, as these websites (particularly petitesannonces) seem to renew the advert over and over again if the person posting the ad fails to remove it... I have been caught out before by finding an advert that looks promising, then I take a closer look and realise it was posted a year ago.    
You could also post adverts on those sites yourself (please make sure you post them in the 'demandes d'emploi'... there's nothing more annoying than searching for advertised jobs and finding half the results are job seekers who haven't bothered to make sure they post their advert in the correct location). Sometimes there are adverts posted in English, and perhaps if you asked nicely someone on here might be able to help you put your advert into French. I'd suggest you take time to look at the different categories and think about what you could do and then post targeted adverts in different categories, for example one advert saying you're looking to work as an au pair, another looking for work as a waiter/ess, another asking about gardening work. This will probably be more likely to get a response than if you post a general advert saying 'I'm looking for work and will do anything' - even if you are willing to do anything, take time to target adverts for different areas of work and think about what characteristics and skills you have which suit you to that work.    
When you're applying for jobs, or dropping off CVs, again take time to target your application to that job or area of work. I'd imagine people are more likely to employ someone who shows they have thought about the area of work and shows some interest and passion for that work (even if you're exaggerating) than if someone applies for a job saying 'I need a job and I don't care what I do.' Someone who cares is more likely to do a better job. I appreciate that you don't really know what you want to do (I'm in a similar position myself), but it seems to me the more interest you show (or manufacture) for a particular area of work, the more likely you are to get a job in that field. I could be wrong - I'm still unemployed - but I've been told the more specific you make your CV and application, the better your chances.   
Also, does your school have a careers advisor? They might be able to give you some pointers either about places to look for work, or about how to write your CV and highlight the skills that you do have.

And in fact I do list some things, which may be noticed and make me stand out from the crowd.   
Remember, the object of the exercise is not to persuade the reader that you're ideal for the job, but to make your CV stand out and grab attention, in a good way. So mentioning unusual voluntary work, sports or interests may just help do that.        Still? I only put one on mine a couple of years ago. Anyway, I'd tend to go with the same approach - an interesting photo that stands out, rather than a passport-type one, may bring your CV to the top of the pile. Clearly if you're an ugly munter then it may be better to leave it off  "	792	 Apr 2012	5	['13', '10']	['302', '167']	5

			That is what most companies do but you need to get a precise figure from your HR department. It's likely they round up or down to the nearest full or half day. It's up to the company so no one here can tell you. However I can tell you from my experience that it's not necessarily written in your contract. The calculation might be in an employee handbook, but get it in writing specifically for you from HR anyway.   
FYI it is also common for part-time workers holidays to be defined in hours. If you just work 4 full days a week then it's fairly straightforward, but if you work shorter days over five days then you book your days off in terms of the number of hours work that you miss.   
Another FYI, you should check with your company what the situation with public holidays is. It's likely that if a holiday falls on a day you don't usually work then you get no compensation for it, but likewise if a holiday falls on a day you do work then you benefit from it. (In contrast, for example, to the UK where bank holidays are more 'protected', so typically part time workers get the corresponding % of the public holidays added to their annual holiday allowance and have to book them as holidays if they fall on the day they usually work, etc. I don't think this happens here, just giving an example.)

2056	Employment	Nanny and baby-sitting jobs for non-residents?	tiffanyd	1710	9	Zurich	21.05.2013, 06:51	" 
			
			I was able to get a nanny/au pair position. I rented my own apartment, but I was also paid a really substantial salary. It is important to mention that is a requirement that the employer's get you your work permit! Baby sitting won't get you a permit...you do have to prove you're highly skilled, in my case I had a B.A. from a great uni in the U.S., and they specifically noted that they wanted their children to learn English, and my former employers in the U.S. wrote nice letters saying how trained I am.   Not sure if that made a difference at the immigration office, but I did get the permit, even as a non EU national.   
You basically just have to get lucky with the family. In my case, mine were really affluent and educated and had no problem navigating through the murky puddles of Swiss paperwork...   
Then, I got accepted to grad school here. I now have a B permit, and I can seek gainful employment (my parents were required to submit all the bank paperwork proving that they would financially support me, this is also really important!).   
I hope this helps!

2057	Employment	Part-time jobs in software development	Kedi	1969	16	Zurich	25.02.2013, 16:12	" 
			
			I thought I would come back and tell any future readers of this thread about my experiences. Less than three weeks after I posted this question I got my first invitation for an interview followed by 2 more in quick succession. In total I have been interviewed by 3 companies (a 4th one invited me after I accepted an offer). After a long interview process I now got a part-time job. My advice to anyone who is looking for a part-time job (or any kind of job in the software area) is:   
1. Scour job search/carreer websites. Don't limit yourself to jobs.ch and the like but go to others like   or  .    
2. German knowledge definitely helps. All 3 companies I have had interviews with were Swiss companies (no multinationals). My CV was in English but I wrote cover letters in German and did the interviews in German. Well, at least partly. They were OK with me answering some questions in English when it became too difficult to express myself in German. I always stated that my German wasn't that fluent at the beginning but people are usually fine if you are up to B2-C1 level and if you say you commit to making the effort to improve your language skills.   
3. Do not wait for a job perfectly matching your background to come up. None of the positions I was interviewed for were a perfect match for me. So apply if you meet some of the criteria. If they see you are good in what you have so far done and you have potential, they give you a chance.   
4. Be patient. They don't invite you for a first interview until about 2 weeks after you application and they usually give you a date for 2 weeks after.    
5. Prepare for the interview. I even looked at some German Software terms. That helped me understand what they were asking me even though I couldn't answer some questions in German.    
6. Recruitment agencies are no good. At least they were useless in my case. They were really interested in my CV until I told them I was looking for part-time jobs. All 4 interview invitations came from companies I had directly applied to.   
7. Be honest. Tell them what you know, admit what you don't. They really value attitude more than acquired knowledge.    
8. Expect a question about your salary expectations even in the first interview.    
9. Last but not least, all three of my interview experiences showed me that Swiss people are really nice and can be very warm and welcoming.

After clarifications it seems that money is a main motivator.

If one feels that the termination is wronglul, there are legal measures you can take, if you find a lawyer who agrees with you. The RAV offices will also inquire about the termination, and may try to intercede if they see a chance to do so. They don't like to see a lot of people drawing from RAV.

			Also consider fit of corporate culture - you seem to assume that a smaller outfit would give you greater flexibility and options for change and progression.  This may or may not be the case.  You are just as likely to find people unwilling to embrace changes and not all that flexible and not willing to give the new guy the opportunity when they could give it to the guy who's been there for 5 yrs.   So if you pursue that opportunity find out as much as possible about the corporate culture.

And then on top of that the OP would still need to meet Irish work permit requirements...  Where the contract is written is not relevant, it where the place of work is and that would be Ireland.   
The only possible way that this would have any chance of flying would be if most of the work would be done here and he visited Ireland occasionally on a business permit.  But that also has long cooling off periods to ensure that it is not used as a substitute for the green card and there is also a cooling off period after the last business trip before one can apply for a green card.

			Perhaps this is the sign you've been waiting for. You've struggled for some time trying to decide if you should  . I'm not telling you to leave, but it is a good opportunity for you to take a closer look at your decision.   
One thing I have learned as an expat is that if you are to be truly happy or at least satisfied in your new country - you MUST stop comparing everything to home. It doesn't matter where you're from, when you are an expat you are not at home any more. The same laws and cultural norms do not apply. When you're going through a rough patch, home will always look more attractive. Once you're back there maybe it will be the Utopia you think it is...or not.   
Wishing you the best. It sucks to lose your job, even if you're only in probation.

			My perspective:  This type of work no longer has to be geographically located.  There is perception that employing resources based in Switzerland would cost magnitudes more than other countries.  For such work, I opt to best-shore to less expensive locations.  The only time it makes sense is if your customer is locally based, and insists on interfacing with someone who fully understands the local culture.   
But of course, there are exceptions.  Look for companies with big data needs; e.g., Banks, Insurance or IT services providers.

			Over the last year I have been acutely aware about the job market both here in CH and in the EU zone. 
The RAV in their infinite wisdom have seen fit to park me at the Job Club for a month..   
Now that the four weeks are over I must say that it has not been too bad, it is geared for the Swiss job market and not for the international market and the clientele seem to come from the lines of sales persons, office jobs, butcher, baker, candlestick maker, clerks and not so much the PhD's and Dr. and Prof's of the world. 
The courses are rather generic and not really directed to those who command a 140.000 p.a. CHuff wage. 
But, they show you the best way to write a Swiss style CV and how to understand what is wanted and what is needed and how to get a handle on the Swiss job market. Also psychological evaluation and guidance on what jobs a person would be qualified for and also information on every kind of job available in Switzerland and what qualifications you need to get a fighting chance, they do not offer jobs and will not find you one, but they will talk to potential employers and guide you through the application process. 
They are now starting to open up to the expat community with courses in English so maybe there is something for EF members wanting a starting point to get into the Swiss job market and just don't know where to look first or how to go about applying for a job in Switzerland.

And about your concern, i don't think you should have any whatsoever cause we're not here to steal your jobs, lands or women, most foreigners come here based on market demand and to fill gaps that cannot be filled locally which results in enhancing the economy performance and insure businesses performance as required....any expat who's here today won't have an issue moving anywhere else to do the job but do you really want this to happen and understand the effect it will cause on the economy / local industries?

			I am assuming you are female and contemplating IVF.   
IVF is quite pervasive but I am not sure you need to take a month off work for it - of course your doctor might advise differently.   
If you are planning pregnancy you might want to be careful about what you tell your employer until you know the success of your treatment one way or the other as some employers like to make difficult for employees with maternal intentions.

The employer should inform him of the necessary paperwork, the doctor will require this information to issue the bills, or you have to lodge them to the accident insurance, and make sure you are pro-active in getting medical advice and treatment options.

Especially after a termination, one's notice period is not really vacation. I have spent all of it interviewing, researching companies, studying for interviews or providing work samples. There is web site devoted to the law surrounding vacation time in Switzerland and they touch on this exact issue:          The   they mention is  :      and they point out that it applies to both the employee and the employer -- neither one can try to arrange an exchange of cash for vacation during the period of employment.

			Hi Everyone!   
Im a canadian citizen with an unlimited B visa set to be renewed in May 2014. To further my professional development, Ive recently terminated my fulltime position here (in the zurich area) in favour of a position which will be on contract - in Germany. However, in order to hang on to my visa I need to remain living and getting my paycheck in Switzerland.  
From some of the research I've been doing it seems I could achieve this by going through a contract agency? It basically seems I need a swiss middleman who would for swiss purposes be my employer and from whom I would receive my pay check. The german company would in turn pay them my salary.    
Thank you in advance for any guidance or leads on how to go about this!

So simplifying those percentages, it would have been: 
Week 5 to birth: 96%, then 92%, then 90%, then 80%   
...of course you'll still have to subtract the various dates to figure out how many weeks should have been paid at each percentage level.   
You have been overpaid by - maybe on average something like 10-15%? - over 40 weeks. If so, that would be 4-6 weeks' full salary, or 6-8 weeks of your maternity pay.  So yes, you will have to repay them something but not the full amount of your maternity pay.

			With a salary like that, I would leave the tax/cost of living thing out of the equation altogether. You can afford to make your choice based on more important things like what you and your family enjoy doing, and where you will feel best.  If you are more city people, go for Frankfurt. If you are outdoors people who want to head for the hills as soon as you leave work, go for St Gallen. Zurich might be a good compromise as it has a bit of both.

			Hello all,   
I was slowly looking for CH-based jobs for past months and I have some first offers, or at least talks about it on my plate.  
Naturally I'll get asked about my salary wishes and I was wondering if anyone can share some insight on what would Swiss employees expect to hear (salary request wise) from to-be expat, looking to move into CH.   
I did go through Salarium, read the sticky posts here... 
I'm not asking about specific salaries, but more of - would an employer (let's say in privately owned company, <10 people) consider offering the salary same as for the CH citizen or would it be 5%, 10%, 30% less because I'm non-domicile. 
Is it even worse when offering jobs to non-EU (which would mean they have to go through permits and stuff)? 
I suppose larger, more multi-national companies would not lower offers as much?  
Do you think there is a difference regarding this in Geneva, Zurich and alikes compared to smaller towns?   
I guess Swiss employers are just like any other people and to go through some additional hassle, they'd expect to gain something from it (like - a cheaper employee)? 
What I'm also wondering is - if I stumbled on company or employer that would expect me to expect less, would it even be smart to work with him/them or that would just mean I may expect further issues and/or underestimations in future?   
That's why I'm posting a question here - if offering significantly less for new citizens is NOT normal in Switzerland, than I'd avoid such offers/companies, but if it is a generally accepted thing, then I guess I can't do much about it, except possibly look deeper.   
BTW, I'm in programming area (mostly web based business services, over 10yrs, on US market), targeting senior roles in CH. I did a lot of interesting things so far, that other competing players on market didn't do equally well, so I believe I have something valuable to offer, but without doubt I still have a lot to learn in any area I'll be working in..    
For first job in Switzerland, I'd possibly accept some non-senior role, with lower pay than (in all my modesty  ) I like to think I could get.   
Anyway, I'd appreciate a lot any input from more experienced members of EF and Swiss job market.

2142	Employment	Move imminent, but still no job!!	steevhugs	1412	19	Worb, Bern	14.04.2013, 15:31	"    Hi there. I contacted the Bernmobil company last week to inquire about positions within the company.  
I read an article last year about a scheme they were running where they would provide full language tuition for successful foreign applicants, apparently they did not want German citizens taking the Swiss jobs!    
Anyway, I digress, they replied saying that there were no positions available and I would have to speak German to get a job as all the signals and radio messages are in German, who would have thought it?   
Thanks for the thought though, I'll just keep on with the Deutsch lernern, I'll find something!

2146	Employment	Au Pairs on bending this regulation	Mike123	2871	25	Zürich	26.03.2013, 11:15	" 
			
			It is correct that Au pairs should not be left in sole charge of children for longer than around 50% of the time. Once again, the grey areas between what people believe to be a nanny and an au pair are very well...grey!    
An au pair should work around 20 hours per week, a bit of childcare, a bit of cleaning, a bit of helping around the house. They are to be treated as a family member, and be ""on par"" (au pair!) with everyone else and muck in with this. Au pairs cannot by law be left with children under 2 sole charge for more than 5 hours a week (I believe this to be the number of hours but not 100% sure, but it's a small amount!). Au pairs I know do the breakfast, get the kids ready for school, prepare some lunch ready for when they come back, and then whilst they're at school, they do some housework, laundry etc etc. Then after lunch are finished. THAT my lovely's is an au pair. If you're in sole charge of children for more than a few hours per day, THAT is a nanny. What happens with some people is that they just don't understand the difference, or do and don't care, then the au pair ends up doing a nanny job, for an au pairs wage, which is not fair. I know an au pair, who worked a 60 hour week, with 5 kids, one of whom was disabled, and she looked after a very young baby as well. It wasn't ""sole charge"" as the mum was ""around"" but not there to help with the child care....it was total role reversal, mum went and did some other work, helped with farm animals, and left the au pair to it!!   She was unqualified, and only 18 when she started....she did a fantastic job, and would have given any qualified nanny a run for her money, but she was paid 500chf a MONTH! THAT is shocking,a nd shouldn't be allowed (it isn't, but the parents bent the rules!)

			Thank you all for your reply and very valuable information.   
Yes, getting married is on the agenda but we would prefer to leave this as an option B (now this option may get an upgrade!!).   
I'm coming over to visit her in August (F1 summer break), so I'm going to try to contact some B Schools in and around Zurich to at least get a feel of the market there.   
I understand and am aware of the employment law there especially when it comes to none EU citizen. I did read a lot of posts here and looks to me like apart from getting a job before I move there (which is a fairly unlikely option), we would need to get married, or I could go and do a degree at one of the business schools there.   
Swissrob - yes that's so random! Yes, she's in communication and media and would be travelling to all the races. And you're right that nearly half the time, she won't really be in Zurich anyway. But getting a job in the UK will give me the same grief! I only have an Aussie and a Thai passport so that would get me nowhere in UK or EU. Plus I'm way too old to get one of those backpacker working holiday visa!

Alternatively you could always freelance to clients needing someone with US legal skills.   
I'd ditch the thought of adding a   LLM degree to your portfolio:  
From a continental European employers' perspective a LLM degree from an English-speaking law schools shows that one has the legal terminology skills. I don't think you need to prove this. 
From a US employer's perspective a European LLM might prove that one has the required German/French/whatever language skills. A LLM degree from London will not help you in that regard - and you should be able to impress a US employer with your current language skills anyway.    
There should be more effective ways to improve your German legal terminology:  Search for some summer schools of 1-4 weeks offered by some German universities, IIRC. Alternatively, inquire with the German-American Lawyers Association

			I was a multi-microscopist, with a experience from AFM, (H)TEM, S(T)EM, Optical etc over several jobs and countries.    
Career advice is: take it easy (actually this applies to all job seekers, incl. me).   
If you plan to keep on the marvelous scientific fields,  you will pay a price for that (forget about your talents vs other less brained disciplines):  
- strong competition (all the world wants a job in CH, and scientist are particularly good in moving).  
-German is nice to have but as long as science is English only, German guarantees nothing. 
- be prepared for time-limited contracts until your late 30s (40s). If you decide to go for them, do not complain afterwards (your decision). 
-do not under estimate jobs outside of your field. 
-do not compare to others    
If you still decide to keep in science (which I will truly admire), take home daily only the good part. You will be much more happy in life.

Most of them rejected my application but there are some who are willing to give me a chance but they do require recognition of diploma from swiss red cross. I already passed my documents for the recognition but until now i am still waiting for their decision. But i have my friends who are alredy working in switzerland as a trainee nurse.They have experiences that's why it is very easy for them to land a job.

I also know the UN offer internships (but no pay), but I don't know if they accept candidates who don't have a degree.   
You could try working for the ICRC. I don't know if you speak languages other than English, but if you do then it's going to help your chances for sure. They sometimes look for translators/interpretors.        
Also, you say ""college dropout"", but from what I understand you're finishing high school and then taking a gap year? Dropout isn't really the right term because it makes it sound like you stopped going to school and didn't finish your education.

2189	Employment	Working for a comany on a temporary basis - what do I need to do?	torts	647	0	Zurich	19.03.2013, 21:21	" 
			
			Hi there. I have recently come to the end of my maternity leave and I ended up resigning because I decided to stay home with my child for a few years. My boss is so nice, he has agreed that I can continue to do some work for the company here and there, on an hourly rate basis, so that I can get a bit of pocket money, and keep my nose in the business to hopefully be able to get back in in a few years time. 
I have no idea, though, how I should charge for this work. Do I need to set up a company? Or can I just write an invoice each month and give my bank details for them to pay me for the work I do? I guess it will be an average of 10 hours a month, not much more. I guess I need to pay AHV on my earnings and I will phone the ausgleichskassen tomorrow to check how to do that, but is there anything else which I would need to pay? (other than tax, but my husband is a C permit holder so I presume I do that through the tax return process). 
Thanks for your help!

As soon as I attempt to go direct, it got difficult, so I said balls to it. Then a company I worked at before got back in touch after a year and hired me back in without an interview, and they have a super reputation. One week after getting back in touch, I started, easy.

			Hi all,   
I am moving to a new place and I would like someone to design the interior for me. Usually designer companies seem to cost a fortune - I found a young girl currently working for IKEA who has no formal education but is very talented, our taste seems to match a lot, and I am finding her ideas absolutely great. How much should I pay her and how do I deal with taxes/insurance/bill to make this all legal? I am a normal IT employee at a company otherwise and pay only Quellensteuer with a B permit.   
Your advice is greatly appreciated.

Going a step further, unless it has changed recently, you are required per (weakly enforced) law to take two weeks (or 10 working days) at one time at least once per year.   
Also, the employer may even disapprove of your desired vacation days due to company requirements (deadlines, production overload, etc.).  On the other side, the company may determine Betriebsferien (company holidays) and you are forced to take your vacation days during this time.

2202	Employment	Business administration internship in Vaud or Geneva region	vief	844	0	Montreux	12.03.2013, 18:15	" 
			
			Hello everyone,   
I am a second year international business and management student at the University of applied science Utrecht (the Netherlands).   
For my curriculum a 3 months internship is required in my field (HRM, Logistics, finance or marketing) The internship is an opportunity to get to know my professional field. The goal is to get a better understanding of the day to day activities of a company by being involved. This can be by assisting a specific person in his or her job or independently conducting assignments or a specific project.    
My boyfriend is a french national but has lived in Switzerland (Montreux) for over 15 years now and has a permanent permit of residence. I am a EU citizen and can there fore work for 3 months in Switzerland without any special regulation.    
I have been looking for an internship (actively since January) preferable in the finance sector, but without any luck yet.    
I speak Dutch, English, German and a little Spanish. The dates for the intern ship would lie between the 29th of April 2013 going on at least 10 weeks (until the 5th of July) or for 12 weeks (until the 26th of July).   
Does anyone know companies that are looking for interns right now in the geneva or vaud region? Or maybe the golden tip?

If 337 days =100% then 69.5 days = 100/337 * 69.5 = 20.6% that's how I assume the 20% was calculated.   
69.5 calendar days is a little over 2 months' absence.   
""Lorsquau cours dune année de service, le travailleur est, par sa  propre faute, empêché de travailler pendant plus dun mois au total,  lemployeur peut réduire la durée de ses vacances dun douzième par mois  complet dabsence"" 
= when an employee doesn't work because of his/her own fault more than 1 month total (doesn't have to be consecutive), the employer can reduce holidays by 1/12th for every additional full month of absence.   
So they could dock her holidays by 1/12th I suppose. But not by 20%!   
It doesn't seem to matter if she had a certificate or if it was an accident, the law only seems to make a difference if she was pregnant...

			Hi there:-)My boyfriend used to work for Alstom the last 5 years. Dump people who were project managers without significance people were getting 100000 per year. I would advice you to go for the 120000 if you are asked pointing out that this is plus or minus anyway so that you are able to get the 100000 which I can tell you for your experience is the ABSOLUTELY normal that they should pay you. The company's language is englsh even though at some meetings-i am sorry I think this is pretty stupid when you announce that formal language is english- they speak german! But if it is not necessary for your job-which should not be unless you are in the production or have to do anyway with people with low qualifications who may not speak english-german are not necessary-but it will be good if you point out that you would be happy to learn-they actually finance german courses.

			@dannyt986 - I have a question if I may, related to the below.   
I am currently in my notice period, being made redundant by my employer. My notice period is 3 months and should be ending 31 Mar.   
On 28th Feb, I was informed by my employer, that as I was sick in January, they have to extend my notice period and I will be therefore employed till 30 Apr. I never heard about this rule, therefore it came quite as a surprise. As however I dont have any new job yet, it is actually a good thing.   
My question however is - in case I am going to be sick again in April, will my employer need to extend my contract again, i.e. to 31 May? Or sickness during the extra month doesnt count anymore.

			I have to agree with Confloozed, yes there will be foreign tourists but also many Swiss so you could be dealing with German, French and Italian on a daily basis, not to mention the occasional Romansch speaker as well.  And frankly why would you expect Belgium, Dutch, German, French, etc, tourists to speak English when they're on holiday in Switzerland?     
The seasonal ski resorts jobs are highly sought after in all countries so employers have their pick of staff.  Why would they hire you, when there are others speaking several languages and therefore better able to cope under pressure in a busy resort?   
Your ability to work out sums and give change will also be tested as waiters/waitresses over here tend to carry money pouches and do the taking of money and giving change back at customers' tables.  It's not done by customers going up to the bar till and paying there as they would in the US and UK.  So you're going to need to be able to count/figure in at least one, and preferably two, of Switzerland's languages.   
I think you do need to come over and visit some of the resorts, ask around and get a feel of what would be possible for you to aim for.  Then work on the languages and see if you can find a job here in a year or two's time when you have more to offer potential employers.

It's called ""HES-SO:Haute Ecole Spécialisée de Suisse occidentale"" and even though I had a good look at the website I couldn't understand what it is exactly. Is it a proper University?? Is it a good school? I am sorry if this sounds like a weird question, but I am not familiar with this kind of istitute. 
Also, the job would be in Sion: is it a good place to live in?    
Sorry if I didn't put the thread in the right section, I was not sure which was the most appropriate one!

Make sure you are in a quiet room and have a good telephone line. If you didn't hear well or the line is bad suggest you hang up and redial (or suggest that they do) if it doesn't improve - don't be afraid to say you cannot hear them well enough (assuming you can't).

I am not sure if Swiss big 4 do similar referral schemes like they do in the UK, but in London I got my foot half way in the door by referral. Still had to pass the interview and competency tests, but otherwise they would of probably thrown my CV in the bin. So, if you know anyone working in one of these firms, look at trying to get a referral also.

			Interesting you say that, the more I was reading on the internet, the more I was getting the impression that Swiss law may not apply anyway. As it happens, my job has always been classed as a ""local"" position, which I understand would then be subject to Swiss law (the reason for this is that they were always employing a local Swiss person as groundsman). However, when I started the job, they officially had the role classification altered so it is no longer a ""local"" position.   
I think its possible that my boss may have gotten confused by the recent switch and has not realised I am no longer subject to Swiss law.

			My advice having recently passed the B2 exam is to follow the flow and let the interviewer decide. If however you are given the choice then certainly opt for English as it is lot easier to convey rapport in your own language.   
The language of the job advert will give you a good rule of thumb. i.e. German advert implies German interview. Unless English is a mandatory requirement in the German advert. If however English is only a nice to have and the job advert is written in German, then I would stick to German.

Either move to a country where you are fluent, or look for a job which does not require good local language skills. Hard advice, but please face reality, there are many people looking for jobs here.

			Thanks for the info. I think this is essentially same as the other national institutes.  
6280 x 13 = 82000 pa, slightly higher tax becos of the 13 month system. 
ETHZ: 83000 pa, and I think it is normally 12 month system.   
Minimum level of emplyment is 60%. So it again boils down to 1:2 ratio of net income.  
At the lowest end is a bachelor at 60% position who pays higher taxes, and at the other end is 100% and married/kids who pays lower taxes and gets additional allowances which may not appear on the contract. I find the difference amazing!!        "	5	 Feb 2009	0	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

			Well don't assume that just because you work for a law firm that they know what they are doing. I recall that whenever I ask a lawyer something they say ""I'm not specialised in that area of law"". Actually this has very little to do with law, more knowing how the slow wheels of the various parts of the Swiss system turn... Be warned - most people that work in it often aren't very knowledgeable on the subject either!   
Anyway, we discussed this at length also on this thread:       
In that thread I claimed that L permit holders will suffer more discrimination, one person responded that they've never had a problem, but your recent experience would suggest that it still does make a difference.

It is expensive, true, but normally you earn more, too. 
Fact is you can live pretty cheaply here, if you don't insist on having an angus steak for dinner every day. 
Food is much cheaper in Germany - but that doesn't mean I want to move back (and basically halve my salary).

Make sure you get/negotiate your reference letter before though.

But I am afraid it does not change a huge amount (I wish it did), what you need to think about is how specialist is my skill set when compared to the Swiss and European people looking for work in Switzerland. Unfortunately for you employers find it much easier to employ residents of Switzerland and the EU-27, as other individuals need special permits.    
Please do look through the forum using the search function int he top right hand corner, there you will find lots of excellent advice and information about permits, job recruitment agencies etcetera. There is even a thread ongoing at the moment where a headhunter is giving advice to individuals about the recruitment process!

			Hi Luba! 
I also applied for this scholarship from my home country, and my boss (in Basel) told me that he will cover the difference if I do get it.   
IA1899, as far as I understand, this scholarship is just liquid money that you can use on whatever you need, but they are definitely not paying for a separate accommodation - at least not in the Italian version of the scholarship! The only thing you get for accommodation is a 3-months allowance (I'm guessing it's for temporary accommodation while you find a definitive one).   
When I spoke with my boss about this he was very happy to help, perhaps you should try that with your supervisors?   
Good luck!

As you may have read many employment related posts in this forum, I would strongly suggest or repeat that you brush up your German language skills. There was an opening for a financial accountant in my company (the one in Zurich), and unlike the other positions, its descriptions were written in German (it might have been intended for a local or German speaking person with the right skills, dunno). Though one example and may not be representative, if this is   what you want, you need to persist no matter.

			I worked for 2 years from home after moving from the US for the same US company, we moved here for my wife`s job.   
You are liable for Swiss tax. If you are paying US social security you don`t have to pay Swiss SS at least for a few years. PWC who handle our tax affairs said this could become a longer term issue but it was acceptable (at least in Canton Zug) in the short term.   
If you are a US citizen or green card holder you will still be required to file a tax return. Basically the rules will apply to you exactly like a US citizen working and living in Switzerland.   
First $90k odd no US tax liability, after that depends on deduction but basically you would owe the US govt the difference between the US marginal tax rate and the Swiss tax rate. If your wife is a US person you will get $90k foreign earned income exclusion each.   
I would suggest you actually get them to stop paying US social security and pay it here instead. This is something I never did and I think it hinders you in accessing unemployment benefits potentially in the future. I`ve never tried to access unemployment benefits here even though I am unemployed and paid taxes here for 2 years because I never paid SS here. My company didn't have a Swiss office (easily accessible) so I just paid US SS as it was legal.   
Any business trips you take inside the US you will also need to keep track of. These reduce the foreign earned income exclusion pro rata.   
If you feel like you will have no US income tax liability (you both earn under $90k, neither of you are US citizens/ green card holders) I would have the US company stop all US tax deductions. I never did this is as we still have US tax liabilities for our sins.   
Good luck.   
I am not sure how ANY of this relates to Swiss visa`s.

			Hi N,   
I have to say, so far i've been unsuccessful with finding bar work in Geneva.  My previous work experience in Scotland is from Aberdeen and Edinburgh.   
I'm confident that it's much easier to rock up in the UK and apply for jobs than it is in CH.  Not only is the nightlife of Scotland in constant boom, but from my experience managers are far more open minded to employing people people from CVs and interviews rather than networking and contacts.   
There are also a lot more job agencies in the UK which will put you in contact with managers.   
My experience of searching for a job in CH has taught me that truly, it is who you know.   
All the best with your search and keep in touch

And if I did that I wouldn't be able to go home and visit my family anymore. I'd have to go through a complicated process of obtaining a Russian visa any time I wanted to fly home, which is kind of a bummer.   
Anyway I'm not prepared to switch my passport for the one of the country where I can't find a job in two years. An African passport would probably be more useful in that sense as there seems to be more jobs in Africa.       In all honesty I don't think the problem of massively missing jobs is going to be solved by YetAnotherJobSearchEngine. There's plenty of them right now and all they do is stealing fake ads from one another. We need genuine jobs, plenty of them, that's the only thing which will help.

2323	Employment	French or Germanic engineering company to work for?	jacek	1299	7	Aargau	15.01.2013, 20:39	"    I think it's difficult to draw comparisons. I work for one of the companies you mentioned, but the experience you have largely depends on   you work with. I know people who have had wonderful experiences in both companies; some who have had truly awful. We have had disgruntled people leave us, only to return (keywords: frying pan and fire). We also experience the opposite; disgruntled people from other companies who join us, and then sometimes return from where they came from. They say, amongst these large companies - Siemens, ABB, Alstom, etc; they're all the same, essentially.   
We had one guy here recently; he struggled with the heavy processes, red-tape, extreme conservatism, interfering management that is typical of a large company.. He came from a small company, and has since returned to a small company.   
I think with these two companies (here in CH), the multicultural aspect is probably more important. We have a fair few Germans here and I find a  proportion of them have a very gloomy and pessimistic outlook indeed; everything for them is always wrong, every deadline is too late, everything is ultra-high priority, everything is taken extremely seriously.. There are no exceptions. My experience of the German management style here is that it won't willingly give you support. If you ask them for support, they seem to translate your request for support as: ""I'm incompetent, stupid and cannot do my job. Please do it for me"".   
All of this can   grind you down (as it has me, if you may have guessed!) Sometimes, even just changing department within the same company can make a world of difference.

When the schools break up (mid July to end August) and over Christmas really.  Switzerland has a strong apprenticeship culture so many school leavers will go straight into those, plus the summer holiday season too so not much recruiting going on then.   
Obviously it depends on the company itself, but those are the general quiet periods.  Switzerland's tax year is from January to December so I don't think there are any special incentives for them tax-wise.

			Thanks MusicChick... My experience so far has certainly been frustrating. After I saw your post I checked this out with the local network and they confirmed they would organise the paperwork if I found my own maman de jour (although this seems to be a little unfair to everyone else sitting patiently on the waiting list) but maintain that we cannot source a maman de jour from another commune until all possibilities have been exhausted in your own network. I had already contacted surrounding communes and they say the same thing, they can't help us even though it is geographically more convenient in terms of where we live and where I'll be working. Have had just one option from the local network which was with a very nice lady although her French wasn't great and the flat was so small and cluttered with junk. I felt it just wasn't a suitable place for children but the standards here seem to vary massively and so much seems to be down to luck. Perhaps I'll just be a good girl and settle down to being a full-time mum for the rest of my life   but thanks again for the advice!

			Some good advice in the replies here and probably the biggest reason why many foreigners in Switzerland are underpaid for their position. It is extremely important to negotiate and state a high (but realistic) salary expectation. The better informed you are about the industry/usual salaries the better your chances of getting a good salary. It is next to impossible to catch up a low entry salary later on through promotions, you are simply ""the cheap employee"" for the company, and they might treat you as such.

2381	Employment	IT Contract via Agency - Payment Part Salary, Part Invoice	magic	1442	7	Geneva	08.12.2012, 13:45	" 
			
			Thought I would post some feedback on this one as I have been offered the contract    
Looking at the contract they pay me gross, I have to undertake all the payroll, pay taxes, have liability insurance, pretty much the normal. However they do have a section that they can audit that you are in fact paying the taxes etc.    
I just sent them a copy of my accountants bill which details doing the work for salary, payroll, VAT, completing the returns, book keeping, annual returns etc. That should I hope be enough to satisfy their nervousness, there seems to be concern they end up liable with some of the bills.   
The contract is 3 months but rolling and there is 3 years worth of work in the pipeline. Apparently I was way ahead of the other 7 people they interviewed (do they really interview this many for a contract role now?). But the best news it is 20 minutes on the bus from where I live so Mrs. Magic will have to fight me for her half of the duvet each night    
No more getting up at stupid O'Clock on a Monday morning to catch a flight just after 6 am.   
The agent wants to meet up with me at some point so I will ask try and get more detailed account of why this area of invoice/payroll has become such a concern for them.   
Lucky for me any extensions are based on the first contract, so I am going to stick with that, after all get in with the client and it becomes a hard to move position on their part.   
Working back close to home, cannot believe it, this is going to be great for my family and me.  "	849	 Mar 2008	5	['6', '6']	['349', '186']	6

But I think you could still find work as a lawyer doing corporate work, NGOs, lobbying, etc without needing a Swiss law degree/sit the Swiss bar.    
Well, it's possible the the people in Geneva are correct, but since you speak French and Italian and looking at some of the links already posted, I'd keep asking around. Maybe ask someone at the other universities that have law schools in the French and Italian cantons (now sure which ones do). There are still some differences among cantons in education.     
Don't dispare yet. And well, to be honest, going back to school isn't the worst thing in the world. Who wants to grow up anyway?   "	9	 Dec 2012	0	['0', '0']	['1', '1']	0

Also by registered with RAV, you are entitled to 4 months of training and that can be language ( I don't know whether you got German or not) or other relevant training if an employer said they will employ you after your training. Have you been to their English session? That is very well explained.

			Make the move, start with this money. Save like every sane person. Work hard and show what you can(I am often offered fixed employment after having worked just a few weeks as a contractor). You will grow. Your wife can look for jobs, your situation will improve once she gets something. You seem to have spirit, thats what counts.   
See it this way, at the moment, there is nothing you can loose. You seem to have zero. You seem like a guy who would risk a shitload for his family. That is respectful, but dangerous. But today, what isnt??   
I think after 10 years of family you have enough experience. I would go for the offer, you will soon have a solution if you deliver a good job.   
Play your card, get out of the shithole. Your children will thank you. I am not a father (yet), but I know how my father felt once he knew I left the crap behind me - today I am able to help him, no matter what.   
For me, that is fatherhood and family. Helping in the worst situation, you can rely on family.

			As quoted from the Swiss Re Referral Policy   
A. Definition of Employee Referral   
An Employee Referral is defined as a friend, former colleague, or close acquaintance of a Swiss Re employee, whose resume is presented and who is subsequently hired.   
C. Referral Process   
The referral resume must be submitted before the initial interview takes place, or the completion of the candidate's application, whichever occurs first.   
The Referring employee must be available to provide a reference for the referred candidate, as needed.   
I really doubt that posting links on forums in the hopes that complete strangers apply and get hired thereby resulting in a bonus for the OP is the goal of the social referral process.   
Seem to me like Burrito is just after a quick buck...Why in this age where personal branding is so important would you want so many complete strangers applying to your workplace and claiming to be your friend, colleague or close acquaintance?

Just got to Zurich 3 months ago and recently started looking around for a job. While Swiss are often impressed by the Chinese language skills, there are definitively very few jobs requiring this skill, which is rather strange.

We were pretty surprised too about how difficult it was but it has been the same for all the positions we have had open this year, has taken several months to fill each of them and for half of them we ended up importing people from abroad.

I know at least 2 agencies specialized in recruiting test engineers.  One is called something like Bvb but I cannot find anything remotely resembling them with google or with the Zurich phone book.  I know they have a billboard very near the Zug bahnhof.  And, I have hired people from them but cannot find any listing anywhere for them.   
Also, there is another agency in Zurich but I cannot remember their name.  when I google, I just come up with job ads, no matter which search I try.   
Thanks for your help.

Also one quick question, which I am not sure if any of you can answer.  I am familiar with IAESTE, and I know Switzerland is one of the participating countries.  Do you think if I contacted the local committee that they would be helpful in telling me which companies have sponsored international interns?  I am looking for a permanent position, but I think if the company hosts international interns that they are more likely to employ international engineers.

			Assuming he`s not Swiss qualified (front the Italian speaking part) I think he will struggle to find work. Most positions in Zurich area also require german. I`m an Accountant/ Controller who followed my wife here and have found it very difficult to get anywhere. Most of the jobs require a local language even those with multinationals.   
There seems to be a bigger market for 2 to 4 years qualified. If your partner is more experienced there seems to be less jobs around as you get more senior.   
Go to jobs.ch and go through and see how many jobs you can find that match your partners skills and only require English (as well as the other languages your partner speaks). That will give you an idea. It seems to help to know people at least around here and Im sure that helps in Berne.

			I have checked the forum but can't find exactly what I need an answer to, and I am hoping someone out there can help me.   
We are employing someone to care for our two kids one day per week at home and I am unsure as what the rules are on holidays and sickness.     
These are my questions :   
1.     I am presuming we have to pay the additional holiday allowance on top of the hourly rate, I see this is 8.33% for 4 weeks per year.  When holiday is taken, am I right in thinking that this is then unpaid, as the hourly extra accounts for this?   
2.     If our employee is sick on a working day, is she paid the full rate as usual?  Is there a set out number of days she can be sick before pay is reduced or stopped?   
3.     I have heard there is an option of a deduction if the employee eats with us, as opposed to bringing her own food.  I have no problems with her eating our food, but what is the normal deduction for this?   
Hoping you can help

			Hi,   
I'm waiting to hear back from a major international company for a 6 month internship post.  I'm really more interested in getting the experience than making riches initially, so I have no issues with an internship in principle.    
I was just wondering if anyone else had done an internship, and if so what was the wage?  I understand there are slightly more rigorous rules around paying interns over here than back home in the UK.  I have a decent wedge of savings, so all I would really be looking for the internship wages to cover would be my rent, health insurance and monthly travel to Zug (from Zurich) where the intership is.  This would probably come - monthly - to about 1500 CHF.   
Does that seem like a reasonable internship wage, or is the average higher/lower than that?   
All info/1st hand experience of internships in Switzerland would be much appreciated.

If you add up the transport, either gas and parking or SBB, prep or admin time, material you use to teach, copies, etc etc., the final rate isn't really that different for both private tutoring or language agency/school. Some school will pay you a little less, since you get the contract for a bulk and a security and they know it.

Use your English as a valuable skill, sell yourself to companies requiring German plus excellent English skills. everyone will know that the German will come back fast as you are Swiss and you spoke it for 10 years.   
And the locals accept language errors: one of our directors is from the Romandie, his German is worse than mine - he mixes up die/der/das all the time, but he is a director of the company. So it is not the language that matters so much as the skills. But communicating in German is a must, and you can do that.   
So focus on some large companies that have international business where your English is an advantage and you will surely find a job.   
And if not, there's always the tourist industry: they love English speakers.

			I presume you will study at HSG where the workload is considerable, anything above a 35% isn't feasible if you take your studies seriously. And there is absolutely no guarantee that you can find a part time job quickly. So don't budget with that extra revenue. You should be able to cover the basic cost of living (apt, food) with your savings, and try to earn something more for your quality of life (eating, drinking out, travelling). There are thousands of foreign exchange students in Switzerland, and especially in St. Gallen (predominantly Germans who should have it much easier finding a job than you) so don't count on it.

I'm currently applying to an LLM in International and European Economic and Commercial Law, at University of Lausanne. I'm also interested in a MAS in International Taxation, at University of Newchâtel. Since the begining I thought about a business-kind of career. 
Do you have any opinion regarding these programs?

However I have another question: in the CV you have to write name and contact info of several references (I don't know about other fields, but in my domain reference is a must in CV). Usually the potential employer will contact the references (if ever) at what time? Before or after the interview? I guess they will only contact the references at the end (e.g. when they make the final decision from the shortlisted candidates)? Is that true?   
I have this concern because, as I just started my current job 2 months ago, my current supervisor will be quite annoyed if he gets a surprising call from another employer asking about my candidacy...

			I have finally applied for a job in CH. I am unsure about the next step and am hoping EFers have some advice.   
It is a small office and my CV and cover letter went directly to the hiring manager via e-mail. I received an out-of-office reply that he was away until X date. Super, except I left CH for holiday the day the hiring manager was due back. I mentioned this in my cover letter, and explained how I could best be reached while away.   
So far I have not heard anything other than the out-of-office reply. I expected at least a short e-mail thanking me for my interest. I won't be back in CH until next week.   
Should I be concerned at this point? Send a follow-up message? Mail a hard copy of my CV and cover letter? I have received conflicting suggestions from family and friends. Some say I need to be the proverbial squeaky wheel or the company will think I'm not   interested in the job. Others say I should just sit back since I told them I would be away.

My son from SA, qualified in various fields, but no good without the language, did that.  He learnt Swissgerman from work and mixing with the locals at the Stammtisch in pub  .  That made him realise how ""dumb"" one is perceived when one is unable to communicate!   
The good news about that is he became qualified in building trade, which enabled him to improve his High German, which allowed him to study at University, and is now a Bauführer for a large international company.

I'm in London and I'm planning to move in the opposite direction, and one of my motivations is that here I have to spend a considerable amount of money (40% of income) to rent a tiny cheap flat in a relatively decent location in the outskirts of Central London (but you also need to consider that Central London alone is 3-4 times larger than the entire city of Geneva). In Geneva, I can see that larger apartments can be rented for the same amount of money (at the current exchange rate) - without even considering that in my sector I would expect to get paid more than twice as much...   
So by moving to London you'll probably have to pay more for your accommodation (definitely relatively to your income, and maybe even in absolute cost), and/or take into account long and probably quite unpleasant commuting...

			Good luck! I'm an architect with a masters degree, 2 licenses, & 10 years of experience from the US. I moved to Zurich last year, and have been learning German daily & intensively (I completed B1 level). I already have a work-permit, but I haven't had much luck getting interviews. There are lots of jobs (as you can see on swiss-architects.com); but as I'm sure you'll also see, the vast majority of architecture work here requires German language fluency (a minimum of C1) and local experience. That is a bit of a catch-22 for people like us: internships seem to be allocated for young students, and I'm not sure how to go about acquiring my first local experience. 
I've only had one interview so far, at Herzon & de Meuron in Basel (because I spoke Arabic and the project is in Qatar); but I didn't get the job. There aren't a lot of international architecture firms in Zurich, unfortunately; I only know of Calatrava (which is also incredibly competitive).  
I'm trying to be flexible and consider jobs outside of architecture (in areas of interest for me: art, perfume, Arabic/English language); but I thought, since my education and experience are primarily in architecture, I'd stand a better chance getting a job in it. I've often considered giving up myself, but that is not much of an option for me (for personal reasons).  
Frankly, I'm not sure this city can offer me the chance I'm striving for. I've recently enrolled in a part-time postgraduate program (in English) at a local university, hoping that that would open some doors for me. I realize that's not an option for everybody (nor can I vouch for its efficacy yet). But even though I don't have much positive to offer, I think sometimes just knowing that you're not alone helps...  
All the best,

Does this mean that i will have to ask for more than that so as to agree to 6500? I dont know how things in Switz work... they are kind of different here in Greece...

			OP, is there anyone with whom you have had developed a relationship during the course of your education or work experience who could serve as a ""mentor"" to you?  What I mean is someone whom you look up to and who would be completely honest with you in evaluating your CV, your experience, and your interviewing skills.    
Also, ten-ish interviews during 18 months of unemployment seems like a low number.  Are you sending enough CV's and applying for all positions for which you qualify (even those for which you might think you are slightly over-qualified)?  Sometimes (especially after a long period of unemployment) just getting a foot into the door is more important than the salary, benefits, or the job being a ""perfect fit.""    
Best to you as you continue your search.

Unfair dismissal only exists if for instance you were on sick leave or pregnant, or were sacked because of your political opinions for instance, or race.    
Even though you cannot get your job back, only limited financial compensation (up to a maximum of 6 months salary, in theory).

			now don't be alarmed but legally all they have to do is pay you up until the 14 weeks maternity pay (unless your contract says more) and they cannot fire you until that time period is over, but at that point you are no longer protected.    
That is the legal side of it, but the human side of it says they would not string you along thinking you are coming back unless you really are and they will hopefully offer you something at the % you want to work and at the same salary level but they don't have to. The fact that they promised you a job when you come back is great, but they have nothing legal that they have to follow so hopefully they prove how valuable they think you are and offer you a great job for your return!

			Hmm...always a difficult question this one. 
I would say that a salary of 150k Swissy is equivalent to around 80k in the UK.   
However the taxes here are lower (especially if you live in Zug), you won't pay National Insurance and you won't pay council tax. The amount of money that will end up in your pocket will be more than you would get on 90k in the UK. 
You are really suffering because the exchange rate at the moment is so poor.   
Prices are comparable to London prices (although I have no idea about childcare) 
I'm sure your financial model will take all that into account.   
I think your standard of living will be much higher here than in the UK, depending a lot on what you like doing. (i.e if you lunch and shop then you will hate it)

im an IT Consultant, living&workin in İstanbul and really tired of this big city which is getting more crowded day by day..considering migration..   
i work for one of those companies, -top 10 in size in  SI/IT consultancy globally-  at the moment and my company has offices in Switzerland. i have +7 years of experience 3 years in banks, 4 years in multinationals (my previous firm was a german one, but i dont speak, English is all i can do atm, and my native Turkish)   
im considering moving to Switzerland -if i can find a job-, not sure if the market will consider my experience valuable.   
i have a computer engineering degree, i did programming for only 2 years, later switched to systems analysis design, IT vendor/project management, worked as consultant for a german firm on BPM/Enterprise Architecture management domains, data architecture, Conceptual/logical/physical modeling of data and other IT assets & capabilities,SOA governance for 2 years -in top TR banks. 
in my current company i did various projects as well, from ""IT product selection for investment brokeragehouses"" , to big IT - telco mergers, roadmap design, project management etc. i can provide international references.   
it would be a lot easier for me to say im a java developer, after that, a small algorithm test maybe, and i would get a job offer, right?   
as i said i did programming in C and JAVA, but that was years ago, and im not much interested in 9-6 coding.i have good command of SQL and networking (attended some CCNA courses for a year , just to complement my general knowledge on IT )   
anyway, i know Swiss have some nice banks around Zurich and a strong insurance sector, honestly i dont know where to start.    
im willing to learn swissgerman or whatever they speak there.    
bonus: im not a EU citizen  
do you think i will have a chance or too old for that ? im 30   
i found this forum yesterday,it looks great, big  thanx for those who maintain it and keep this going ..

			Hi,   
First of all, I would like to say hello to everyone, as I am new to the forum. 
I have searched the forum, and have not seen this question yet.  
Please let me know, if you think an existing thread already covers this topic. I sincerely apologize if this is the case.     
My situation is this: 
I have been offered a very interesting opportunity in Bern. My wife and I are of Belgian nationality and we are living in The Netherlands. We are really keen on moving to Switzerland. We are married and we have a little baby girl. If I am to take up this position, it is very important that my wife also has professional opportunities in the broad region (essentially French-speaking Switzerland for her). 
Now, my wife has a degree in law (Master), which she obtained in Belgium. Her field of specialization is competition law (anti-trust, mergers and acquisitions, ...). She chose not to qualify as a lawyer until now either in Belgium or The Netherlands (i.e. doing the traineeship, and sitting the bar exam).   
While looking on the Swiss recruitment websites, we saw that most employers for a legal position require applicants to be qualified as Swiss lawyers. My wife's diploma is recognized in Switzerland, and as far as our information is correct, she'd have to do a 1-year traineeship and pass the Cantonal bar exam in order to become a qualified Swiss lawyer. However, she's very much interested in working as an in-house counsel in a company.   
My questions to the forum would be:  
How do Swiss employers look at foreign legal qualifications ?  
Does anybody have experience with finding a legal position in Switzerland while having a foreign legal degree ? In particular with applying for a Swiss qualification (through the cantonal bar exam) with a foreign law degree ? 
Or, on the other hand, have you been succesful in securing a position as an in-house counsel with a foreign law degree without qualifying as a Swiss lawyer ?   
I would really appreciate any helpful feedback, as this is the main blocking element to our decision to move to Switzerland. If this is important: my wife is fluent in English and French.    
Thanks in advance for your answers.

But, you know what, good for you.

2570	Employment	Claiming Social Welfare: Valid loss of employment	Express999	760	0	Interlaken	21.09.2012, 19:49	" 
			
			Consulting the AHV website about Claiming Unemployment benefits for EU citizens resident in CH, it says that proof of a valid loss of employment must be given to make a claim. Firstly, if a person is dismissed because they aren't considered suitable for the job, is this a valid loss of employment? Secondly if a person has difficulties with the job, they are very unhappy there or unable to cope with the pressures, are they penalised when claiming benefits.    
It indicates that the unemployed person must have worked a minimum 12 months within a 2 year period but it doesn't mention if in addition to that contributions made in a 3rd (EU) country (i.e. not your home EU country) to the social welfare can be counted towards it. I know CH has agreements with EU countries although its not part of it. I read somewhere that your home country could pay your social welfare if you worked there within the last 24 months. If such thing is possible, would you actually get the welfare benefits of that country instead of the Swiss one for a period of time or will it be added on top? I'd imagine most countries in the EU have a much lower pay out for social welfare.   
I've not been able to glean better information in English from an official source. Should anyone have a good source in English and you can provide me a link to it or any reliable advice, please let me know.   
Thank you.

The only reason for the scary deadline is so they can be sure that you'll act ASAP.

2577	Employment	Companies with English as their Business Language	brianmccabe85	2757	9	Zurich	28.03.2012, 21:43	" 
			
			Brian, what you need to realise is that most Swiss people, and Europeans speak English anway, just take Austria or Germany for example. An English only speaking person is not of great interest here, unless of course you have a special skill set, and a basic European language in not really a skill set.   
Whilst a lot of international companies work in English, the people who work in the individual departements work in their own language,m be it German, French, Italian or English. It is here that the information flow has to work to ensure the departement works correctly. If everybody is jabbering away in Swiss German, for example, and you don't understand and you're part of a lose team, then the dynamics are lost and the tean cannot work properly. People will make some effort to assit you and you'll pick up the language eventually, but in the meanwhile, it's not easy to have a non speaker within a small group of people, speaking fluently the language of origin.   
The fact you, we all speak English is not such a great selling point as most people educated in the Swiss system speak English anyway. You need to emphasise your other skills and qualities.

			It's difficult to get permits for non-Swiss, non-EU citizens as these are first in the queue and there are quota limits for the rest of the world.   
The other problem with being self employed over here is that you don't decide you're self employed, the Swiss authorities make that decision.  You can apply for a self-employed permit, but if they don't think you meet the criteria they won't issue the permit - and it's still subject to the rest of the world permit quotas as well.  You'd need to have written evidence/contracts from at least 3 different people/businesses that they are going to employ your services and they may require more.   
It might be slightly different if you're coming as a trailing spouse, but that might also depend on the nationality of your other half.  If she's American too, then you might not be allowed to work here as a trailing spouse.  I'm not sure what the rules are on that side of things.

			Hi, I am in a similar situation: looking to gain status of ""self-employed"". Apparently they don't make it easy. I visited the AHV in Zurich and got a broshure that lists conditions that you have to meet. The hurdle for me is documenting multiple clients through invoices and/or contracts. The other option for us crazy people living in CH and working outside the country is to register as ""Arbeitnehmende eines nicht beitragspflichtigen Arbeitgebers (ANOBAG)"". Someone who is working for a company that is not obliged to pay into the Swiss Social Security. As with being self-employed you will be required to pay in yourself. HOWEVER... I don't think that this will get you the tax benefits you would have as a self employed person. For that you will need to prove that you meet the self-employed conditions.  
I hope this is somewhat helpful. Good Luck!

  I am working on a project at school that requires us to ""evaluate"" a company that speaks English as its official language.    
We would essentially come and make an environmental footprint plan for the business, and form a report that would indicate areas that could be improved to increase performance and environmental sustainability.   
This would be done for free, and would of course not be published or any information learned during this project would be deemed confidential.  The end result would be us presenting our findings to our project leaders, and to the company as well (If they so desire).     
Please respond if you know of any companies in the Luzern or Central Switzerland area that are 250 employees or smaller, and speak English as their official language.     
Thanks so much! I am studying Business Engineering: Sustainable Energy Systems at HSLU in Horw, if any of you are curious!

			I could be way off base here, but what the heck. As far as I know, ADT is a security firm even here in Europe. If that's the case in CH, then a ""freelancer"" probably is someone cold calling to sell their security systems and monitoring services. In theory if you sold X amount in 5 hours then you'd make a commission of 340 CHF. But I don't know for sure. Just thought I'd throw it out there.

2615	Employment	Forced to work 80% when pregnant	Marrisol	3146	32	Basel	24.08.2012, 23:09	"    This also touches on an important issue.  If the OP goes part time then is either fired or leaves for whatever reason, when the question of unemployment benefit comes up, she will be compensated according to her last salary, which will be a max of 80% of the 80% she was working at.  If she can, I would suggest she try to remain at 100% if at all possible.   
In addition, when I was claiming unemployment benefit, my advisor accepted that, although my son was only in daycare 60%, I got my 100% entitlement of benefit. I argued that my son had been in daycare 100% up until I had been made redundant and I simply couldn't afford to keep that up whilst unemployed.  The nursery was willing to take him back at 100% when I started a new 100% job.  OK, so maybe this is an exception but it illustrates that the RAV are willing to discuss and be lenient when necessary.   
I suppose I was fairly lucky with my son and his health, although he was sick a few times with stomach upsets, random fevers and the odd cold.  The law says that a parent is covered when their child is sick, as if they were sick themselves.  A doctor's note should be produced, as normal, but for a few days off here and there it is not a big issue.  Obviously, if the child is long-term sick or has a condition that keeps prevents the parent(s) from working, alternative arrangements have to be made but it's no use future-planning your working life based on worse-case scenario.  Rather just stay informed of the options should XYZ happen.

a.scientific interest applies to highly qualified scientists working in R&D in areas of high economic interest and  
b. economic interest requires a demand for that particular qualification for a particular position, the new position generates new additional jobs or new revenue/orders for the Swiss economy.   
Studying law is probably not the best approach to get a foot into Switzerland. You may want to look at a job qualifying you for CERN (but search for the other thread on citizenship preferences), studying in order to become a watch maker or a doctor. But even for these positions you will be competing with EU citizens. 
And, as you should know when contemplating law studies: Laws are subject to change. Who knows what this law will look like once you graduate ? The same applies to the economic environment.

			Maybe I'm stating the obvious, but it's obviously important to have a good up-to-date website with references and a portfolio. As well as looking for jobs, keep looking for freelance as well to increase your portfolio, add contacts, expand your network.    
I'd apply not only to vacancies but even any companies that might hire people with your profile, just to let them know that you're out there and to show them what you've already done.   
You've probably got links for the job-searching websites, but I'd also look for freelance projects on classifieds websites like anibis.ch for the French speaking region (not sure what the German equivalent is, someone will surely post it).   
Good luck.

There have certainly been threads on here where people have been seeking English-speaking architects, so that they can communicate their wishes properly.

2648	Employment	Had a PhD? Share your story.	hiaw	10779	85	Bern	12.06.2012, 14:28	" 
			
			It should also be pointed out that PhD programs differ between the US and Europe.  Typically, US PhDs are 4-7 year affairs (depending on the field) and do not typically require a masters degree upon application.  Euro PhDs typically require a masters degree (2 years) before application, and generally last 3 years.  In total, both routes typically take the same amount of time, but if you did a masters in Europe and then did a PhD in the US, you'd be in school for a long time.   
Keep in mind I am speaking about science and engineering.   
I would counsel anyone considering a PhD first to decide if it is worth it - you have to want to do it, for the right reasons.  If you have a natural curiosity and a passion for a topic or just learning in general, then yes - do it.  But if you just want a title or a fat salary when you graduate or your parents to have something to brag about to their friends, it's really not worth the suffering.   
By the way, whoever assumed only rich kids get PhDs - that's an incredibly ignorant statement.

As an alternative, take notes of who agreed what, and major topics of discussion. At the end of the meeting, type it all up nicely, send it around and ask for any corrections.   
90% of the time no-one will even read it, and then your minutes stand as the only true and accurate record of the meeting. It's nice being in control.   "	3	 Jun 2012	0	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

			I don't hold any hope, but you could try to negotiate an increase the salary. Temporary jobs are just that, flat pay rate for a fixed period.    
BUT! Sometimes you get to see the internally advertised jobs, and for this reason I would go for the job and look for something better.

			When you leave your old company, they should contact you to ask what to do with your pension (2nd pillar) funds. If you have joined another Swiss company, they will provide you with the information to give to your previous employer.    
In my case, I am now working for a German company, so I am no longer contributing to the Swiss pension. In this case, the pension manager sent me a form asking what to do with my account. I contacted my bank (in this case, Basler Kantonalbank) and asked them for the right forms, which they sent to me. I forwarded the BKB forms together with the questionnaire from the pension manager back to them.    
My pension fund money will be paid to a BKB ""restricted"" account - I can then ""manage"" this money (investing it in mutual funds, etc.) but I cannot withdraw it until I'm 65 or I completely leave Switzerland and the EU.

			Depends what you mean by strong.   
You can be technically briliant and have a CV that tells that story but if it's 5 pages long then really the CV could be seen as weak because it is too verbose as and it won't get the attention it deserves!   
Personally I have a CV that has a short intro, a list of key skills and then detailed experience. Only the last position gets more than 2/3 lines. Is someone really interested in the detail of a project you did 10 years ago?   
The personal stuff (age, nationality, etc) I always leave to the very end. It's not key information and could be lead you to be discounted before they get to the good stuff e.g. Age: 50 ... um he's too old. No point in reading the rest.   
These are, of course, just my personal opionions and I've been in the same job for 10 years now. I did update it last year when things looked a bit 'shakey' with the bank I work for but so far my CV hasn't been tested!

			Never been to Portugal. How expensive is it there? 
I have a co-worker who has worked in a number of countries (UK, Brazil) and he said: ""However low the cost of living seems to be in a country compared to the salary, living in the country that pays the highest salary turns out to yield the highest disposable income"".   
OK, so he's a bit of a special case (very small flat, but GA and spends weekends in the mountains with his SAC buddies).   
You can adjust your cost of living downwards, but you can't adjust your income upwards.   
Of course, everything turns out different once you get CxO-level payment and move to Asia, with servants, chauffeurs, cooks, house-maids, paid-everything etc.

			The e-mail can be viewed as an offer to treat and is not legally binding by any means. Same when you go to a supermarket and see a price for a good. It can change both ways... What is legally binding is a written contract with signatures that confirms the understanding of the document (in your case a working contract).

After call, it seems that it's not trivial.   
When we code, and create program - source code, object files, which are subject of ""Copyright Act"" :      (no english translation) 
(I've asked for translation on appropriate thread :   )   
On   page you can find reference to : 
""Barrelet, D.; Egloff, W.: Das neue Urheberrecht, 3nd ed. Stämpfli Verlag, Berne 2008. ISBN 978-3-7272-9563-8. (German)"" 
I've been guided to check out comments according computer programs, but unfortunately I can not find this book... (not mentioning it's in german)   
I can not check in mentioned book interpretation, could you ensure me if I am right that: 
design of program, algorithm can be separated from source code ?   
If yes, 
AFAIK designs can be covered by mentioned ""Art.332 OR (Obligationenrecht, key part of the Swiss Civil Code)""... 
but...    
I've heard that ""fundamental principle of contractual freedom is predominant"", so if contract states everything is owned, it is if it's the same activity. 
So it would mean, that if someone do programming at work, than programming in free time  can be owned by company (another topic if for additional compensation or not...). If that's true, than it means that agreement from employer is needed ""you can do such kind of programs at hobby and own them"".

			Hi,   
My daughter has an employment contract with a base number of working hours/ week at 21 but additional hours to be worked at the request of management. The company is a Swiss company. For the last year she has worked an average of 36 hours/week and has paid AHV etc on these hours.   
A month ago she was sick for 4 weeks (with a doctor's note) and her employer has paid her 80% of the 21 base hours for the 4 week period. I have been told that the sick pay calculation is based on the AHV contributions made and therefore i believe that the payment should be 80% of her average working hours per week.   
Has anyone any experience of this? Is there some official body that she can talk to?   
Thanks

Whatever happens, your employer in CH is entitled to request an independent assessment by a doctor of their choice. They are not entitled to know the exact medical detail - but they can get confirmation or negation, of the cause of illness.

			If it's not in the contract, then it should be regulated in the ""personalreglement"" which is an integral part of the work agreement and should lay out disciplinary procedures etc etc. and be available to all employees.   
If it's in neither it doesnt sound very serious to me... take care.   
I wouldnt make too much of it not being an expat contract. We have a few juniors with no family ties etc where we helped with the move and some free accomodation but not much more.

			I´m on RAV since beginning of June 2012, so my Rahmenfrist runs until June 2014, so plenty of time left. Now, I am most likely going to get a temp job for the nine months (11/2012 - 7/2013). I assume the salary will be higher or the same as my current ALE, so I wont get any top up payments from the Kasse. Fine. I also know that if I end up jobless after 7/2013, I can go immediately back on my old ""RAV salary"", i.e. the ALE that I am receiving now because it falls within my Rahmenfrist. That is all clear to me.    
But what happens if I find another temp job, say for six months for example, starting immediately after the previous one ends and I do not have to go back to RAV in between BUT then after the second temp job I end up jobless. Am I still on the same Rahmefrist ALE amount as originally, providing that this happens before June 2014 which is the end of my original Rahmenfrist? Also if the second temp job pays less than my current ALE, am I still entitled to receive the top up to 70 %? I am pretty sure the answer to both is ""yes"" but I just want to double check, just in case   "	142	 Apr 2006	3	['0', '0']	['28', '19']	4

Why Switzerland? I've always been deeply intrigued by the country as it's the country my family immigrated to the United States from in the early 20th century. Although we're open to other countries, there's something about Switzerland I find particularly alluring.

			Hi, yes you need to contact the Arbeitsagentur in Hamburg:    
They will need an 'Arbeitsbescheinigung' from your old employer(s):       
Your old emplyer is required by law to give you one of these when you finish your employment.    
After you have this (or several ones if you were emplyed by different employers in the last years), you can put your request for the E301 in writing to the Arbeitsagentur.   
I just went through this process in Munich and it took about 2 months to process. Maybe if you let them know you need it bad as you became unemployed here, they could be quicker.   
Good luck!

Apologies 
The role is in the Nyon area. Yes- it involves relocation from Ireland. I think it is a bit low (should be about 10-12% higher). Partner is native French with fluent English.   
We would like to buy a 2nd hand car/camper van (if possible) 
We are happy to live in a 70m2 apt near to the job (with spare bedroom for guests and storage space and car parking space)   
We are vegetarians who would like to travel around Switzerland/neighbouring countries on the weekends now and then. We like outdoors sports (skiing, cycling,hiking, anything really)   
Pub/cinema/dining out : 1-2 times per week (not 1-2 each but in total, and dining out can be simple)   
Dinner 'party' for friends 1 per week.   
1 social activity/learning activity per week (eg French classes)   
5-6 bottles of wine per week.   
I head it was cheaper to commute from France and if so, in that case I was interested to find a farmhouse (if feasible) to grow our own food for example.

			Hi swisspea,   
Your advice is good and fits with what I have been told... however there are 2 kinds of sickness insurance which employers can hold. Insurance organised by a private insurer (LCA) do not have to accept all employees, and even insurance organised by an insurance company under the federal law on health insurance (LAMal) can refuse to cover pre-existing conditions. (Sorry if that's not very clear - I'm trying to translate a rather technical passage in French from a book. Main point is, you may find yourself either not insured at all or only insured with exclusions.)   
So it may be that an employee finds themselves in a position where they have a condition which may recur, and where, if that condition does recur, they are not entitled to any sick payments beyond the employers statutory obligations. It happened to me. Not helpful to your recovery, perhaps not 'fair', but there is very little, it seems, a person can do about it.    
Your post reminded me - OP, have you arranged your own accident insurance? Now you are no longer working, you will not be covered, so you need to get that in place. I just called my health insurer and asked for them to modify my policy to include accident insurance.

From what you have said, I would imagine a doctor would either sign her off sick at 100%, or possibly at a lower percentage, for example 50%. However that second option might not be helpful as her employer might pressure her to work longer.    
However, before she does this, I would suggest that she checks that she will still be paid if she does this. If she has only been employed since April 2012, she is still in her first year of employment and is therefore only entitled to 3 week's sick pay. However, it is important that she knows that the end of her sick pay entitlement does not equal the end of her contract.   
If her employer has a loss of earnings insurance (assurance perte de gain), she may well be covered for longer absences due to sickness. But there are different kinds of insurance so she might want to check that sick leave due to stress is covered.    
If your family member does go down this route, a useful little book to read is 'Troubles Psychiques et Travail Salarié (the third book on  ). Although most of it is aimed at people with long-term psychiatric difficulties, it does have some information that I think would be useful for your family member. It has a section on what happens when you are signed off work with a psychiatric difficulty (I believe stress counts as such), including more information about sick pay. It also has information about protection against abusive sacking. It gives advice about what your rights are if you become ill as a result of your working environment and are then threatened with being sacked, and also about what you as an employee should do if you feel your working environment is making you ill.    
I hope that she manages to find her way through this situation.

			Hi there   
Actually, I can confirm happyrobbie's information. 
I checked this with the tax office in Zurich for our service   quite a while ago.   
More precisely, I was told that an employer has two options: 
1. Clear directly at the employee's living canton 
2. Clear all employees at the canton of the company   
Option 1 is easier for the employee since s/he does not have to take any actions at the end of the year. However, for large companies, option 1 is not viable because of the administrative overhead. Therefore Option 2 is commonly used.

			To introduce myself; I am a Physiotherapist who graduated from King's College London in 1999 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physiotherapy. 
Since then I have worked in a variety of medical areas, specialising mainly in orthopedics/sports injuries. Coming from Ireland my mother toung is English, 
I speak also German fleuntly and have worked as a Physiotherapist in Germany fr the past 5 years. I am now looking to move to Basel and would be be very happy if anyone has some tips on employment openings. 
I am confident working through German but would prefer to work through English if possible ! ;-) An opening in sports massage/with sports teams etc. would also be very interesting. 
A slight change in career path I would also find very exciting, for example I am told that there are many, for example medical supply firms around Basel who employ people with a Bachelor of Science degree for research/client training purposes. In addition I am also told that native English speakers may be sought for such positions as in medical writing/ various stages of clinical trials. 
If this ""rings bells"" with anyone and you have any suggestions I would be really happy to hear from you! 
Best wishes

			We used to run a small agency in the UK. What is the nature of your business, match UK nationals to Switzerland and Swiss nationals to the UK. Remember in Switzerland au pairs have to be placed in families who come from another cultural background, so you cannot for example place UK nationals with a UK family based in Switzerland.  You could place for example UK nationals in Germany and German nationals in the UK, based in Switzerland without a licence. I would start with the British Embassy in Switzerland or the British / Swiss Chamber of Commerce. How good is your German?

			If you can, take the time to do full time study in German (I realise this is not always possible, but if you have the option, use it).   
In parallel, why not volunteer to clubs. Most people speak English and if you are offering support for free, they may take you up on it.   
Not only will it keep your skills ""live"", it may even help you improve your German faster.   
For starters, I know Basel Rugby Club do a lot in English, and having a physio on board is a valuable asset, and will even get you an additional string to your social life if you want.   
There was also a Basel hockey club advert/call for players today on EF, and it was in English, so maybe another opportunity.   
Ultimately, if you want a ""local"" job though, you'll need to get that German up to speed. As for 4 months, it isn't that long to be looking for a job, especially if your German isn't up to speed.   
Good luck.

I found them correct and professional , certainly no time wasting event.   
Sadly enough the jobs offered so far are a bit to far from where i live ( traveling to certain areas is not that easy using only public transport    but i wouldn't call them bad now.   
They are one of the bigger and better agencies out there, as smaller ones do mess around.   
BigBlue2 is correct.. the staff who interviewed me are also foreign nationals ,chances are big one of them is on the forum also.   
Also note that EF is well known in agencies around Switzerland, a few told me to check it out as jobs come up on the forum also   so yes..they are watching.   
If you want ,i have a list with agencies and companies i emailed for jobs already... as said i didn't find any but that's probably me

Since my wife already received these benefits, I was getting a difference between Zurich and Zug - 80 CHF per month per child.

However, I have seen questions posted by others where it becomes fairly obvious that the poster isn't a native English speaker. If you had not identified yourself as a non-native English language speaker, I would have assumed you were a native English speaker.   
I wish you the best of luck in your endeavours. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that if you try to become an English teacher and fail, it will not be because you don't know English well enough.

			Hello everybody! This is my first post here and I would like to ask some questions and see if I can get an answer. 
In the first place I would like to apologize for my English (as is not my native language).   
I moved to Switzerland just one month ago and I would like to start working on something. My main problem is the language, I don't know anything in German and I can understand basic things in french.   
I moved to Spain since 2005 and studied there the next:   
 - Microcomputer and Networking Systems (2 years) (1 month internship with a company)  
 - Management Information Systems and Networks (2 years) (6 month internship with a company)   
I've done my studies in June 2011 and in November 2011 I start working on a company there (in Spain) for 6 months. I left that company to come here but now I'm a bit afraid about my future. Why? I will explain in the next lines.   
The language: as I don't know to speak German yet I'm afraid to join a company and start working without any clue of German, I guess it would be a hard point to start working.   
At this point you may ask yourself whats the link between the thread name and what I've said before...well, I will shoot my main question.   
Can I start working as Webmaster/Webdesigner by myself? I mean...make an add somewhere over internet and start making websites for people. 
Do I need to make bills for every work ? It is legal to just make a website for someone (for money) without having a company?   
I hope you got my question and I would like to hear your point of view about my situation. 
I hope I posted on the right place and sorry for giving all this information before the question.   
Thanks in advance, 
Respectfully, Cristian.

2809	Employment	Job sharing	Fcolosso	1541	11	Schwerzenbach ZH	07.05.2012, 10:42	"    Indeed. From the client's perspective, my experience with job sharing was also a complete and total nightmare.   
Perhaps it's just human nature, but the problem with job sharing is that when two people are responsible, the reality is that no one takes ultimate 'the buck stops here' responsibility. In my experience, communication was disastrous, deadlines were routinely missed, chasing down the appropriate person was a waste of my time. Ultimately I fired the agency. The whole experience left me with a very bad opinion of the concept.   
A 50% job, with clearly delineated responsibilities, is a different matter altogether from job sharing. This can be done successfully, as long as the scope of the project is appropriate.   
Perhaps job sharing might work in some fields, for certain kinds of jobs. But not in my field, not at the professional level.

I am currently an academic researcher at the CHUV in Lausanne, and I am currently looking into becoming a freelance scientific editor, but I do not know where to start. I have written and published scientific articles in well respected peer-reviewed journals, and also undertaken an editing and research job for the WHO. As I am normally one of the only native english language speakers in the laboratories where I have worked, I have corrected many forms of communication including theses,  grant proposals, and letters. Additionally, as I work in both english in french I am quite able to translate documents.   
I believe that I am rather good at this task and now I would like to see if I could make this part of my career. If anyone has any experience in doing this, any help would be most appreciated. I should also mention that I would ideally like to do this work from home, but would be willing to commute from the lausanne area for meetings with potential clients.   
Many Thanks,

			I'm assuming your permit allows you to work, and that you've checked out everything you need to regarding hours you can work, social security, tax, insurance etc. If you haven't, I suggest you do that first.    
When that's all clear...   
If you just want to advertise your services, try posting an advert on small ad websites, for example   and  . And make sure you put your advert in the correct category. You are asking for work, not offering work.    
You could also try advertising   and perhaps  . I haven't used either of these sites myself so I don't know if they're free, but they are websites which are more geared to educational and training adverts.   
You could also have a look at the international schools in Vaud. Some of them do summer camps - you could ask them if they need additional tutors.   
Have you thought about contacting language schools in your area? They may be running summer classes. Ditto for Migros.    
Finally, if you have a place where you can hold your own classes, you could just put up posters and adverts in your local supermarket, on those free ad spaces at train stations etc. There is someone who lives near my parents who seems to do that quite often in the school holidays - she puts up adverts for summer classes for children, two a day at different levels, with limited places. However if you're thinking of doing this in your own home again I would imagine you'd need insurance... and to check with your landlord.    
Hope that helps.

			As mentioned, the permit-situation is such that you won't get a permit. 
I remember a case some time ago where the the director of "" Schauspielhaus"" in Zurich (imported from Germany) wanted to bring the nanny they already had into Switzerland. 
Only problem: the nanny was from Bulgaria, which at that time was not EU and thus couldn't get a work-permit. 
The issue was quickly escalated to the political level, but the Migrationsamt said they couldn't do anything, either. 
What did the guy do? He brought her into Switzerland anyway, causing a big scandal...       
The women who worked on the case and quit her job over the handling of the affair was eventually awarded a full year's salary as compensation...

			I would read the terms and conditions of offer A. As mentioned before, when you accept an offer you are on probation for 3 months. During these 3 months you can leave the job according to the T&C you have signed. If you have, for example, 4 months notice period then most of the times during probation the notice period is much shorter --about weeks. This information should be in writing in the offer. I would do my best to not make any breach of contract from your side.   
Anyway, when this happened to me  , once I had offer A in my hands I called company B and said ""I have in my hands an offer of £££year and £££bonus"". Then B came with a better offer in a couple of hours. They know that when you have an offer in your hands they have to move quickly as your time to sign is limited. I personally would do the same in CH.

Factory and retail - around 3.5-4k and more gross per month.  
The unemployment around blue collars here is low, but this is true for skilled jobs nonetheless, i.e. with formal training and experience. You better try applying from Poland, as here you'd need 1k+ per month to barely survive for a shared apt and food, not including health insurance (for a short stay).

			I do wish you the best of luck - but without one of the national languages, it will be very hard. Young Swiss people are finding it increasingly difficult to find a good apprenticeship (any, in fact)- as there is more demand than supply. Most employers will take on the local youngsters, as they work closely with the schools and the Career Advice officers. As they have the 'pick of the best' - you will have to show exceptional talent or experience for them to take you on without speaking the local language, or local contacts/network. Have you got the Swiss end of school certificate, which is normally required? Perhaps you might find something in Hotel/restaurant in a tourist area due to your other languages.   
Does anybody know what sort of permit one needs to apply for an apprenticeship?

Right now am confused and I don't know what to do.  I am not able to get any kind of job (dishwasher, cleaner, etc).  I got more than 5 years of experience as a video maker.  I applied to two university in the french part but did not fit in because I need to have a CFC(Internship of 3 years).  It is almost impossible to get a CFC if you are not swiss and don't live in the french commune.  Can anyone recommend me a course, a job or anything that I can do with my qualification??    
Thanks

			Hello guys,   
I had a telephone interview with Alstom last week, which I think it

What kind of questions are they going to make?   
What is the procedure after that?   
I am so anxious so If can somebody come back to 
me with some answers I will really appreciate that.

			If you have worked a minimium of 12 months in the last 24 months you will be entitled to benefits. Insured salary is based on the LAST 12 months earnings, even if you only worked 6 months the total salary will be devided by 12 to arrive at a monthly amount.

On the recruiting website for this company where you do all the application stuff online you can choose what language you want for communication (German or English) and I did choose German as I can talk...I just don't like writing!   
Fingers crossed.  Last time I applied to this company I heard after 2 weeks so hopefully in the next 10 days or so I will know something...    "		 Jun 0001		[]	[]

So it should not be very hard to figure out who your father is. I assume there are not much Spanish / French Civil Engineer VPs in Zurich area.   
I am pretty sure that there are some HRs scouting EF as well and your father would not be happy to hear that his situation is discussed openly in internet.   
I kindly suggest you use this   and close this thread.  Also, please also note that the executive headhunters work continentally so your contact doesnt need to be in zurich.   
Cheers

However don't get your hopes up too high, unless you have special skills, they will first hire the locals, then selectively the permit-holders.   
Don't believe anything about being ""equal"" in job hunting. Swiss locals come first.

Simply put, Can I as a non EU citizen with a student B permit have more than one contract at the same time during the school term break?

			Hi tangkamma,   
I admire ur passion about pursuiting ur medical career here in Switzerland and i wish u all the luck. I am afraid i dont have a first hand experience to tell right now but i have some points to make clear for u and Goldtop and others; 
first, doctors with non-EU diplom may pursuit a clinical career in sweitzerland in most cases as residents, providing finding a job first and then apply for work permit by the Canton. 
Secondly, u cant take the specialization exam after ur residency except when u have a fully recognizable diplom (which is hard for non-EU), and that is what Goldtop is talking about. 
The process of matching non-EU  medical diplom in switzerland is complicated but u can check  it under:   or    
Good Luck again!

There is the problem of residency, but as long as your friend is a resident and paying the foreigner's withholding tax, I don't see why they would have a problem. If he is looking for residency, it is technically possible, but a very very big hassle. With the residence/work permit, there is a cap to the amount of days you can work (and/or live...) in CH. Mine is limited to 240 days. There are many kinds of permits out there, but this is one of the weirdest.

You might be able to come back as a job seeker. As far as the RAV are concerned unless you opened your rahemnfrist they will base the payout on the LAST 12 months earnings, if 6 months were zero because you were away then your benefit is half! 
If you already opened a rahemnfrist you have any days you have not claimed in the system. However if you leave CH for 3 months you B permit is finished.   
To get a C permit you need to be in full time employment when you apply,  it will also expire 6 months after you leave. You can apply to be away for upto 4 years.

			Guess 115,000 CHF will suffice if you have other expat benefits such as housing.  Geneva is more expensive than Zurich and housing is even more limited.  I know somone who works for the UN in Geneva and he has a rent controlled apartment at around 2,800 per month.  I'm not a tax accountant but I am an expat working for a large insurance co. and my good washington, dc salary was grossed up net of tax by quite a bit plus my housing is paid for.  My level of experience would likely be similar to yours but I do have over 10 years experience in my industry-non manager.  If I were to stay on here in Swiss land and work as a ""local hire"" I would demand more than the 115,000 that was mentioned by another member.  What would a tax manager make in NYC?  Last I checked Zurich and Geneva are about 25% more expensive than NYC.     
Good luck and get what you need.  You only have negotiating power before you get the job.

			hello all,    
I would appreciate your opinion regarding a referral letter.  
The one and only firm I worked for went bankrupt on me (not my fault ) so I happen to have two referral letters which are absolutely  but have different ""names"" and have been signed by different people:    
1.  regularly signed by my former direct boss and the department boss. this was given to me upon maternity leave (planning to go back). 
2.  signed by the   when he took over and after I had resigned of my own will.   
Now probably it would be more correct to include n. 2, but I feel a bit uncomfortable about how the insolvency administrator is going to come across: can a future employer think that at that stage they were giving everybody positive referral letters to make up for the loss of the job?   
this was not the case: as I said, he just took the same letter as before and signed... so I am quite tempted to include letter n. 1 instead (it states in the letter that the reason for the referral is due to maternity break), even if the employer might ask himself WHY I dodn't get a final zeugnis    
thank you so much for your input, even if just subjective!

			Hi Emma,   
I took the CELTA course at academia in Basel last summer. The course was intense, of course, but also very beneficial - both in terms of what I learned & the opportunities it opened up.   
I'd been teaching for about a year prior to the course, but as I was uncertified I was having trouble building it up to something full-time. A lot of schools require some kind of certification, and these tend to be the schools that pay a little bit more.   
Since January, I've been working full-time (about 25 lesson hours a week) and earning enough to support my family. We're not rich, of course, but it pays the bills, and I enjoy the work.

After six months when i get back on RAV will my daily payout be based on the temp job salary or the daily pay out based on my original job?   
[HTML]Taking temp jobs with less pay then you previously took is a sign to the  RAV that you want to work, discuss it with your contact at the RAV.     [/HTML] yes i want to work, but also aware RAV may force people to take lower pay jobs, if taking a temp job for a few months reduces my daily RAV allowance afterwoods it may not be in the best interest.

I would be wary of making any major decisions right now, stress has a way of short-circuiting your normal decision-making abilities.     
It sounds like you inherited a lot of work on very short notice.  Maybe that's the nature of this job and it will happen over and over again, or maybe it's really just a one-time disaster: your predecessor left without finishing this important project and so now you've got to pick up the slack.    
I don't know enough about the job or project to guess which it is. What's your gut feeling? Any chance life will improve if you can just survive this one killer deadline?   
If so, my advice would be to hang in there - but get some help. Talk to your boss. Explain how much work there is to do, how many hours it will take, how many hours are left between now and Friday. Then make a specific request for help. Point out a particular area of the project where someone else could jump in effectively without extra training, and ask if there's any way to make that happen, just for this week. No harm in asking, right? Especially if the alternative is you quitting the job entirely.

			I am an American with a B permit and I have been married to my Swiss Husband for 8 years. I have only lived in Switzerland for 1 year. I went to RAV as well to see if I was entitled to any benefits, specifically German classes or assistance with Swissifying my CV.   
  It was a long process, and I got a big NO at the end. I did not qualify for any sort of assistance because:       
  I understand the reasons why I was denied. Even though it seems a bit harsh, I found my RAV counselor I spoke with to be very kind and wanting to help. She just had her hands tied from the restrictions placed on her.    
  If you were to ask my advice on if you should go to RAV and ask for assistance, I would say to go and ask. Theres no harm in trying. Just do not to get your hopes up.   
  At minimum, getting together all of the paperwork they ask of you is something you will have to do anyway when you search for a job or find a new one.

			Hey guys,   
I am new on the forum but have used the search function to try to find an answer.   
I've worked in Geneva before, between November 2011 and February 2012. I worked as a receptionist/porteur at a relative's hotel.   
This relative of mine did all my paper work for me and necessary registrations. However, this relative is now on holiday and cannot answer my question as to which registrations/documents I have.   
I would like to know which basic registrations and documents  I currently have. Which are the standard registrations one needs to work in Geneva, Switzerland? I worked without an official work permit, but I did, however, pay ""taxes"".   
I paid the following things, according to the deductions on my pay slip: 
GS 
5010. Cotisation AVS/AI/APG 
5015. Cotisation assurance maternite 
5020. Cotisation AC1 
5040. Cotisation AANP (code A1)   
Again, I need to know what has most probably been registered for me as I want to apply for a new (summer) job in Geneva this year. I would like to inform my potential employer that I have certain registrations in place in Geneva, Switzerland.   
Thanks in advance, 
Fred

			Without qualifications, your partner is in a vulnerable position - unfortunately there are employers out there, especially in the domestic arena, who exploit young people like her, knowing that an unqualified employee has few options.    
These 'pieces of paper' mean a lot in Switzerland - and often even moreso for entry level jobs.   
(For example, in Mcomos' example above: I don't know about child care, but the person he/she hires to look after the dog needs to take the SKN at a minimum.  Qualifications in one form or another are needed to do all sorts of things here that no one would ever think necessary elsewhere.)   
Someone with impressive qualifications and skills can get away with only English in many fields - but for those without the necessary 'pieces of paper', a basic command of German is likely needed to open doors.   
If your partner's German isn't to the point where she can pursue a course of study, I would make this the first priority. Get her German up to speed - this would be time well invested.  And then look for jobs.     
Wishing you both all the best.

			Just for information, here is an update. 
I (luckily) did not get the job in the end so it did not matter.   
After arranging the first 2 interviews by myself, I hoped the recruiter would start to be more active with the possibility of a commission coming.  I had to phone literally 10 times to follow-up before getting any reply.  What was funny was after finally realizing the possibility of something happen when I the 3rd interview came up, the recruiter suddenly tried to be friendly and invited me for a coffee (I had never met them before in person).   
I have learned a lesson from this case, I now look much more by myself for jobs advertised directly, a good site is jobs.ch  These days there must be few companies who do not advertise directly on their website & you will have almost the same information as many of the recruiting agencies.  I already got a few interviews myself by going directly.

Make sure you read the conditions carefully though... where I work, you are allowed to build up a maximum of 120 hours' overtime (I think). If you are working eighty-hour weeks, you would hit a limit like that very quickly - so make sure you know what happens once you hit the limit!

			I think you need to get some sensible advice here. There exists in Switzerland an organisation advising the public on education and training. It is extremely useful for school leavers and will give free competant advice, there are pamphlets and books at the centres, but it would be best to ask for an interview. It is a part of the cantonal education department.     , are in most Cantons, including Zug where you live and Graubunden where she wants to study.                
The Hotel industry is a very serious profession, and I think your daughter needs to avoid a half baked training course. She is probably bi-lingual and she can build on that by taking a proper hotel industry recognised apprenticeship, and the BIZ will be the best place to get some impartial and up to date advice. She will learn hotel management, languages, wine cellar, cooking, and of course waitressing.

And it is also possible that you are very specialized in a field where qualified personnel may be hard to come by, and they could be so happy to get the talent they need.   
Nevertheless for regular jobs within the Swiss market, work certificates are a must.

			This is an excellent post, thank you   
Funny you said that: in my previous life, my favorite subjects and the ones I got the highest marks on were Latin and Ancient Greek, but in terms of careers, I thought ""Then what?"". So I picked my ""second favorite"" subjects, which all involved playing with numbers. With a lot of hard work and a lot of luck (being lucky with an internship and landing in a high-demand, growing field), I feel I made a good career choice. As you said, one has to always stay updated with current developments - which in some cases happen daily - and the struggle is never over, but I am happy I chose what I did: moderate liking with good career perspectives vs totally love it but high unemployment potential.

			Hello Heather   
I did a CELTA course last summer as I wanted a sideline. I did it in London as it was less than half the price, no sorry, almost a third of the price of the same course in Zurich!!!!!!! I found work but not as much as I thought. The CELTA was a great experience and prepared me well for teaching classes of students.   
In Switzerland the pay for English teachers is relatively high but the demand for English teachers is low. In the UK there is higher demand for English teachers but the pay is c***.   
You can get work here but it may take some time to build up the hours. Job adverts for well known language schools in the internet attract very high numbers of highly qualified English teachers. I found part time work through the Uni jobs board. It won't pay for your pension but it's fantastic fun and a great learning experience and you can have holidays abroad in exotic places and get paid for the privilege (well near enough). Other teaching work here can be very well paid and there are some serious shortages so English teaching may be a good start to a career here.   
Find a course in England here:       
I recommend doing a five week course if possible as it is so intensive.   
Find information on countries here, including Switzerland. The information is in depth but now a bit dated:       
I have found a few interesting job adverts here:         
Let me know if you need more details. Good luck with looking for a job. It can be very hard work finding something but it's worth it.

			2 round-trip airfares seems unreasonable. But you could get a girl from Italy, France, Germany, Slovenia, or even the UK with very cheap travel especially if booked at the start of her (his) stay for Christmas and say Easter. Our Au-pairs ate with us on days off, and if they chose to go out that was their 'problem'.   
I really feel for young families trying to find solutions for child-care, here or in the UK, or anywhere else. It is heart wrenching, full of guilt and angst, and a financial nightmare. Our daughter has a fully qualified Nanny near London and it costs a GINORMOUS amount of money and takes a great part of her salary. She sees this as a way to stay on the ladder and continue the slow climb- so that one day it will reap benefits, in the long term. Not easy- and I feel for you. I couldn't work when mine were very young as OH's job just had to take precedence, and it would have cost me a lot more to work than not. But when they started school, it worked very well- and like my daughter, gave me the chance to start that professional career climb, with the security of back-up. Initially ate a big part of my salary, but paid out after a few years.

			hello Ativals, i am the same age like you, and also similar experience (1 year java development, 2 years sql development, some own python projects, and another students jobs).    
here i am actually working as a python developer + some embedded software development in very very small company. maybe you can also look for some small ones - there you can find more familiar approach, which could be really helpful while being first months here.    
there are plenty of such small companies which needs some developer guy to cover their IT needs (i think so). what is definitely true (and as also my boss told me) you 'll get lover salary as in enterprise world, but also you can have more freedom (comparing to my home country where i used to work for ""big names"" i found very nice to have free choice of technology and task priorities).   
as soon as you are here, you can get in touch with all big companies and comparing.    
what you should except in this ""small business enviroment"", is maybe more types of work, and maybe also some not-IT work (i spend 5 - 10% of time doing things, which just need to be done, but dosen't have anything to do with IT)   
and as i am reading this forum, in small company, i am much more sure about the fact i'll be not fired tomorrow as in big companies - but again i have much more lover salary, than these people, so you have to know, what is better for you.   
regarding technology - if you love python (i am hope so   ), there are not that many jobs as in java (try to compare results on jobs.ch) in zurich, but i 'll definitely never want go back to java.

If you register it means you give up some rights about what you are looking for and where, and they also have expectations of how many CVs you send out/month, etc - because it is designed as unemployment insurance, and you can't access counsel without going for the whole thing (financial aid included even if you don't want that).

			I don't want you to put your hopes too high but it seems you don't need necessarily the SVEB nor vast teaching experience to hold language class. (But it would be a very strong asset working towards such a qualification). What is necessary though is a background in language studies. My candidature at a private language school for a tutor position was received well - hence I don't 'formally' qualify as a teacher seen my former professional background. This school offers an initial training of four weeks (which includes coaching and feedback for teaching in front of a class). 
If your looking to qualify as a teacher for adult learners please look up the websites of EB Zürich and SAL Zürich. They offer at least the SVEB certificate, but so do other institutes.

			Hi. Thanks for replying so quickly. In terms of experience I have taught children and adults, mainly adults. I have taught Trinity GESE exams, IELTS and some FCE but mainly General English, at all levels. The fact that I don't have CELTA has never been an issue before I have taught in Australia and I am currently located in London, teaching in a private language school. Are there any useful websites I could be looking at?..google is suggesting too many general sites.    
My masters consisted of 6 weeks teaching practice in Hungary.    
I think one of my major questions is, can I teach in schools, because I have heard mixed reports about teaching there. Some say you need a BEd in teaching, others say you don't.    
Another worry is my level of French..I am only pre-intermediate and learning French is one of the reasons I would like to go to Lausanne. I have heard of many people moving to Switzerland because they have partners there, but I want to move because I want a change. What are the set up costs like over there?    
Thanks so much for all your help on this..I am very greatful for any advice I can get!

They track our hours 'in' work at Novartis, and treat you like adults, which is nice. Was just wondering about it.   
I'm several hours in credit (time spent at work), and would be a bit weird if some of that extra time was just trawling the internet. (Or as a French friend and colleague put it, ""we are always stealing things from work!"").   
Before anyone gets excited, I a) love the French in particular and b) those were his words.

With the salary that you mention, you won't feel very happy in Zurich. You need at least a 90% salary (it goes with the 150% of work   as usual).

Now you are completing for English only jobs with other EUs. You have no advantage really.

I'm sorry you're angry and this is happening to you but remember that the economy is crap right now, a lot of people are on RAV, and there is a lot of paperwork to process and these people are overworked and dealing with a lot of sad cases.

3004	Employment	Advance one's career from senior developer to project manager	frogdr	4296	13	Wädi	28.01.2012, 15:37	"    Hi, I'm a Program Manager for a large multi-national, been doing that for a couple of years now. If you want to jump to project and then program management any certification is nice as it gives you a management methodology to use for a project or program. However for successful Project Management, and much much more so Program management, people management skills are more important than which project management methodology you use.   
My recommendation is that if someone doesn't have the tolerance level to deal with the people/emotional management (ie: task, time and deliverables) ego, otherwise known as stakeholder management, and how to politically block out distractors who want to either butt in, divert or introduce scope creep for their own gain at your expense, then it's not the right job for them.   
At times managing all of that can be frustrating and sometimes be left wishing for the good old days when someone else dealt with all of that, but if you're someone who wants to be in on the decision making side of things it has it's rewards.   
One last thought..if you're serious about making the move a DIMACK/Six Sigma certification (green belt minimum) carries a lot more weight than which project management style you're certified in, and that trend is strongly growing in the Consumer Packaged goods industry   
Good luck

			Hi everyone,   
Easy way of moving to Switzerland didn't pan out so I'll be looking for a job as all normal people do        
I'm Software Architect with 11 years of experience.   
I began my career as hard-core C++ engineer building peer-to-peer application for Windows (174 million downloads on CNET).   
Then I shifted toward C++ server-side development (Windows as well) building media-streaming services.   
Then I worked on online survey engine building it with Java, Tomcat, Amazon EC2 and MySql.   
Finally I landed on my current job building web-services with C# / .Net (I had no knowledge of .Net before this job). But eventually switched to another project where I led development of Windows client for content delivery platform (similar to Valve's Steam). It's written mainly in C# with few C++ libraries for security stuff. We have it deployed on 40M machines right now but planning to cover entire range of hardware products across the world of our company with it.   
And in addition to that I have side-project which is web-portal for my friend's mail/messenger company. It's website built with Java, GWT, RequestFactory, hosted Google App Engine. Plus they have very very simple Android client which couriers use on their phone.       
I'm concerned that I'm not focused on one particular technology. I know this and that, and I can build product according to business goals. But on other hand I can't say I know something  . Yes, I'm pretty good at C++ but not to the point of knowing internals of Boost or doing crazy metaprogramming in Alexandresku style. Plus I haven't used it extensively for over 3 years although I can get to the speed fairly quickly.   
Same thing goes with Java and C#. I'm good but not to the point of quoting CLR specification.   
I have no formal CS degree. I still haven't finished reading Cormen (I'm on 300th page) :-)   
Question to you is.. Would you recommend me focusing on one particular  thing ? How should I market myself on Swiss IT job market ? What else would you suggest ?   
Please share your thoughts. And thank you in advance.

			Babies are very adaptable and it would be quite easy to slowly transfer, day by day, to 1.45, and then again after 4.30pm, with water given in between. We are only talking about a couple of hours here, not a half day- so providing the baby is not just weeks old- adapting should be quite easy and make little difference. How old is the baby? I am very pro-breastfeeding, but feel that one has to give and take in order to ensure more positive responses from employers in the long term. Bonne chance.

3020	Employment	Advice on unemployment benefit and the swiss law	nasa2000	1000	0	Fribourg	29.02.2012, 11:19	" 
			
			I was wondering if anyone could provide some feedback on my case...   
I worked in Switzerland for four years and through out all those years I was paying-like everyone- my monthly ALV contribution.   
Last December, my contract terminated with my employer (contract was for 4 years, and they could not renew it). Knowing about that ahead of time, I started looking for jobs within the notice period, registered with RAV, filled in my ""Job hunting sheets"" -even with more jobs than the 8-12 required by them- that I got from my RAV advisor, to make a long story short...I followed the procedures for claiming the unemployment benefit that I was paying for.   
After a lot of letters and paper work, I received a letter from the ""Amt fur Wirtschaft"" on 15th of Feb (my contract ended last year and filled in for the benefit from 01.01.2012) saying that they are not sure if I am eligible to claim this money or not, and they ask me to be patient because checking will take them time. 
I called them on the phone, and they said because I am a non-EU (I have a B-permit valid until 08.2012) they have to check with the Immigration.   
So far, I got no more updates from them. I made my own search and found that actually the nationality of a person has no role upon claiming the AL benefit as long as one have a valid residence. 
As I found on this page (German), point three (Wohnen in der Schweiz):         
To this end, I would like to know my rights and if what they are saying is making sense or not. I payed my ALV, I followed the rules, I have a dependent child (which actually should reduce the waiting period of the 10-20 days not 2 months!), I am looking for jobs, so I think it is fair enough to ask for what is my right.   
Any feedbacks would be much appreciated.    
Finally, is it possible to extract the act of the Swiss law or article number that mention that everyone who worked for 12 months is eligible for AL claiming? Could anyone provide me with the text of the law or guide me where to get it from?

			Reasons why the authorities might knock back your permit:   
- employer fails to demonstrate that they have advertised properly across Switzerland and the EU for long enough to 'prove' they can't find a suitable applicant inside Europe. 
- employer fails to demonstrate how your skills/experience/qualifications are fitted perfectly to their prospective job 
- employer offers a salary below what is considered by the authorities to be high enough - based on accepted averages for that position, or a basic cost of living assessment. 
- employer stuffs up paperwork or completely bungles the application.   
In general, Non-EU permits are for highly specialised jobs, and particularly where the job includes building the expertise of the team, or local staff, passing on skills/expertise to other 'locals' and/or increasing employment opportunities...   
If you do get issued an L permit with an 'open/permanent' contract ,there is a risk that they will not roll-over to a B after the two years - the application process has to be repeated to convert the L to the B - the employer will have to re-advertise the position and demonstrate for a second time that they cannot fill the position from within Europe.   
If you are lucky enough to get a B permit without any major 'strings attached', good for you, but don't plan your life on that basis.    
The 'good' news (if you can call it that) is that if they are going to knock the permit back on any sort of 'fails to meet requirements' they will let the employer know pretty quickly. The authorities are actually not bad at telling an employer what they need to do, and how to jump through the hoops, or how to at least make sure the paperwork is done properly the first time...   
I've heard of prospective employers having to re-lodge the papers because the salary was deemed too low, and we were advised that a permit for a person from the 'New EU' would not be approved unless it was for a 100% position.   
Oh, and I thought of another problem with L vs B - L permits are tied to the employer, and it can be very difficult to change jobs whilst you are on an L. Once you switch to the B, you usually can change employers without all the added paperwork. (I was working for one employer, and signed up to start with my new employer the week that my permit rolled over from the L to B, to avoid a lot of headache).   
I am aware of one person 'in real life' and one person via the forum who was able to get permission to change employers, but both employers had to be in support of the arrangement, and even then it was not easy to convince the authorities...

3028	Employment	Unemployment treatment from Swiss government - who has the experience?	yezi	825	1	An	26.02.2012, 21:34	" 
			
			Basically it works as you say.  A few key details:   
If your salary was more than 3797 CHF per month and you do not have children, you will get 70% of that salary from the unemployment fund.  If you have children you will get 80%.   
You will not get benefit payments immediately after registering as unemployed. The waiting period is between 10 and 20 days depending on how much you were earning. There is no waiting period if you have dependent children.   
If you have resigned from your job or been fired for misconduct, the unemployment office can delay the start of payments by anything between a few days and several months.   
If you are aged 25 or over and have been contributing for 12 months, you will get unemployment benefit for a maximum of 260 working days (Saturdays and Sundays are not paid). If you have contributed for 18 months, you get benefit for 400 days. If you have contributed more than 24 months, you get 520 days' benefit. Here again, the conditions are better if you have children.   
In all cases, you have to prove that you are looking for work as soon as you know that you are going to become unemployed (even before you sign up for benefit). Typically you will be asked to provide evidence that you have applied for between 8 and 12 jobs per month, and you are only allowed to refuse a job offer under certain strict conditions.   
You can read the full details on the confederation's website, in French and German respectively:      "	182	 Jun 2010	3	['3', '2']	['18', '17']	0

			Having worked all over the U.S., I can say that I've never been asked to take a drug test in California, which is a good thing.  I think that drug testing is a violation of my personal sovereignty, and I would refuse to work for any company here that requested it.  Fortunately, in my 15 years in IT no one has requested it.   
This is not because I take drugs, it is because the insinuation that I do is insulting, and I wouldn't want to support a company that engages in such an invasion of privacy - nobody is getting my bodily fluids unless it is for medical reasons or I'm dating you.     
I think that what people do off the clock as long as they don't hurt anyone is their own business, and I definitely think the war on drugs in the U.S. is worse than the drugs themselves.  I think that ""drug free workplace testing"" is an extension of the war on drugs which is another reason I don't support it.  I value privacy over any so-called ""integrity"", and if co-workers use drugs on their off time and still are able to do a great job on the clock I think there is no problem.     William S. Burroughs managed to use heroin and other opioids his entire life.  Sigmund Freud was a daily habitual cocaine user in the days where it was still legal with no ill effects.  Those and countless others managed to be successful and still have a ""drug habit.""  I think it is WAY past time that the world just legalize, regulate, and tax drugs already and get rid of the stupid and childish social stigmas as well -- we'll all be better off for it.

What permit / visa are you on at the moment? 
I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but as non-EU kiwis are in a tricky boat permit-wise, and experience tells me a job-hunt without a permit or fluent language skills is an uphill struggle.....also even if you find a job you may well have to leave CH to apply for your permit from NZ!   
Marriage of course will make everything (administrative-wise at least!!) easier    
The answer to 3 is much easier - here! EF is a wonderful collection of (mostly) helpful and kind-hearted souls...and keep your eye out for the social events for meetings (as a kiwi you keep your eyes peeled for news of the ANZAC service in Vevey.......complete with wine and ANZAC biscuits.

			Lying is never a good idea, whether in job hunting or otherwise. However, it's perfectly fair (in my view) to refuse to disclose your current earnings. I spent twenty years dealing with recruiters, mostly as a contractor, sometimes as a permie, and it's never in *your* best interest to do so. Salary is never a good guide to capability, and a good cv will speak for itself.   
If a job is advertised at a salary of x and you have the experience and capability to do it then why should you be excluded from applying on the basis of your current salary? - if rate x is significantly above your current salary (which you've told the recruiter) then you won't be put forward. I have close friends who've been in the business (as recruiters) for many, many years and they won't hesitate to put you forward if you seem capable, but may hesitate if you label yourself as a ""salary x"" type of person. Always be confident in your own ability, and never be afraid to say no to a recruiter.   
They are all nice guys and gals for the most part (excepting all the ones I had to take to court  ) but never forget that they have *their* interest at heart first and foremost - you always need to have *your* interest first and foremost.   
good luck!

3067	Employment	Swiss Citizen living in Japan. Could I find a job in Switzerland?	nickm758	2173	9	switzerland	19.12.2011, 01:41	" 
			
			I'd like to thank everyone again for the advice. I'm sorry I never posted any more responses, although I have been reading a lot of other threads in the Employment forum. The ""No German, no job"" thread was quite scary, I must admit.    
Unfortunately since I have barely two Francs to rub together, it will be a while before I can make it to Switzerland   Still, I'm doing my research, reading about the RAV, etc. Unfortunately the Swiss Embassy in Tokyo wasn't very helpful.   
I have a few questions ... 
1.) If I were to land in Switzerland with no money, no place to stay, etc. what they do? Tell me to sleep in the park? I've read that they try to find relatives to support you first.   
2.) I believe I'm registered in Zurich. Since I'm not planning on doing #1, how much money should I plan on bringing? 5000CHF looks like it wouldn't last very long at all.   
3.) Are there age restrictions for jobs in Switzerland? The US is usually okay about this, but Japan is very straight forward: ""we want someone under 30"" for example. I'll be 40 in a few years, which I think wouldn't be all that attractive to a potential employer.   
Thanks again for everyone's help. Sorry to ask so many questions.

			You don't need to wait until her bump is showing (generally around 4 months), but 6 weeks is very early.     
So many things can happen in the first weeks/months of a pregnancy that you may want to wait until at least 3 months and have confirmation of a healthy pregnancy before informing anyone. (At 3 months an ultrasound is done where they check for normal development.)     
Congratulations and good luck with the pregnancy.

			HI there,   
I worked for a while in a bilingual school in zurich teaching years 3 and 4. From my experience there I found that there is a huge amount of additional work teaching in a bilingual school than a non-bilingual one.    
The relationship with the partner teacher was critical. With us we got on well but we spent hours and hours doing the weekly handover, discussing the students, curriculum and we were both there at parents' evenings. Then the policies, curriculum, homework etc all had to be translated and this took hours too.    
Not sure what curriculum you are following but mine was basically a Swiss school with half the curriculum delivered in English so I had to teach from maths curriculum and follow other documents I was not familiar with and were obviously in German which was very taxing as my German is poor. I also had to teach new kinds of gym lessons (trapezing and ice skating) and for this I did not really feel comfortable.   
Anyway, this is not to be negative about your job but actually a long winded way of saying I was paid 10% more than the cantonal teachers on the official scale and this was to reflect the additional work that working in a bilingual school entails. I thought this was more than fair and is something you could argue for if it isn't already part of what your school offers.   
Also the salary would have been going up more each year and the rise was more than I expected. I did not stay to enjoy this rise though as I decided to leave.  I think that the levels you have been quoted seem a little high but not overly so.

			Thanks... kind of makes sense... although I'm still not sure in that case where I would go to find the complete job description!    
I asked my mum and we came up with two alternative scenarios that might explain the strange response:   
a) The lady on the other end of the phone thought I wanted to train as a secretary and was telling me they didn't offer that course... which would reflect badly on my French!   
b) The lady did understand my question, and what she was telling me was that the GED and BPV both refer to the fact that the place of employment is an haute ecole de sante. She just didn't make that explicit... which would not be a good reflection of her communication skills.    
Any other ideas?

			First, if you were working 45+ hours per week, you were not an au pair.  There is strict work hours, including language classes, etc for an au pair, and generally you also have to go through an agency.     
If working as a nanny at au pair salary, you were definitely being taken advantage of.  Did they pay your AVS, other social deductions? Not sure what you mean by witholding tax?, but presumably they did pay their share of insurance, AVS, others?  I would ask them for clarification on what the money is for and compare to what you have already had deducted.  If AVS or insurance, best to go to those agencies directly.

I've never been anywhere in the world where women are allowed to work, and this includes the US, where such rampant attitudes towards women with children were so unabashedly and unashamedly displayed. Sure, in countries like the Nordics where women can take up to 3 years of leave for a child, it has some chilling effects on hiring women but, with much lower immigration, it's less of an issue. I don't think CH has much of an advantage on the US (if any at all since there are seemingly more legal protections for women of child-bearing age in the US) in terms of being a woman, especially a woman with children who wants to work either full-time or part-time. It is a very striking difference for CH from the rest of the EU.

These are the questions l always have in mind though I always try to think positively, still I'm  .    
I graduated  t in the Philippines yet I never had a thorough training in my field after graduation because l opted to work right away since there was an available job in Taiwan as an Integrated Circuits Inspection Specialist.

in Switzerland that would accept me for an   in hospitality industry as I would love to make use of mygraduated course   
It's still important for me because l worked hard for it. Just imagine a young woman with a tiny body working as a part timer in a fast-food chain 4-6 hours a day, seven days a week while attending full time classes in college. Ugh  Anyway, I'm done with it.

			From the HR soapbox, i would never ever put my bdate on the CV. It is unprofessional to have it there, and as an hr rep, one has to pretend not to see it - unless one is applying for a small, local company. Anyway, the age is easily deducted from your graduation year! I also am not in favour of pics... It usually speaks of local experience, and of a lack of global exposure....   i've seen cvs going in the bin for less... Should you add a pic after all, let it be super professional, no self shot in front of your laptop.    
The main recommendation i have is to craft both cv and motivation letter to the position you are after... It is a lot more work, but it pays off. It shows you are interested, that you understand the position and the requirements, and that you've done your homework.    
And aftr interviewing, say thank you. It is a great time to make some extra points, or to remind the hiring manager who took the time to see you what a wonderful person you are, and few think of doing it.

			It sounds like moving from one little scam to each bigger scam.  
First the Swiss passport gets him here past truly qualified people, or interest in being in Switzerland. Then host family takes him on, paying his expenses here. Then he uses their house as a base to search for work he could not find from where he was before. Then he reads or read before arriving here, that he thinks Switzerland just willingly recruits bodies to pay their lifestyle while they search for work. So he is tired of being an Au Pair, and wants to instead not work at all while Switzerland sets everything up for him. Finds him a job, pays his expenses, and educates and integrates him into their system. Really, their aren't that desperate for bodies to fill up space.   
I mean it's not like options 1 thru 5 were all Au pair based jobs and he just wanted to find a better option in that field. As far as any of the Au Pairs I have ever met are concerned, they weren't using that work as an opportunity to stay permanently, but rather as an experience as whole, as mentioned before, the pay is normally not so great.   
The Unemployment insurance is set up so that people who are in a dire situation, and for the moment are not working, but have contributed a fair amount over the past 2 years(just as any insurance policy one would pay into), are taken care of.   
 I mean I would never crash my car, and call up a private insurance agency and demand them to pay for my repairs, when I haven't taken on their insurance, nor made any payments. So why should this be any different?   
  In effect if you couldn't afford to come here on your own steam, or by the way of a company contract in hand, why should your unemployment in Spain(assuming it's where you were before here), be any more important to your un employment here?    
AND PLUS, you are actually, by working under the table, taking a legitimate job from a job seeker here, thus adding to those in the unemployment lines here.    
The un-employment insurance here is under funded, and they already passed measures in the last year to try to delay and cut payments to recipients, because not enough people are paying in as they are taking out.    
So pardon me if I come off as aggressive when some one comes on here and publicly states he wants the best advice on how to get over on the system. And I don't feel this way just because of being here. I felt the same in the US, and the same in France. It's a common scam and I don't appreciate working my tail off to meet the requirements for that safety net, and to hear someone looking to coast there way to actually get paid to look for a job.

I will be very hard for me to get a job without a bachelor that's why I am asking for some Advise if you already experience or know someone who had the same issue as me. There are many qualify people out ther that could fit better than an unskil person like me, eventhough I have 1 yer of experience in a callcenter.   
My husband and I got married quite young and we decided together that I will work and support while he finishes his study and then I'll start Uni as well, that's why as soon as I found a job I stick to it and really didn't search for something else until now that I really need the experience.

Come for a visit(!) You have the option of being here for 3 months, without a work permit, on a tourist visa.  See if she is really the person you thought she is.   
When you have  , come for a visit. If she too, believes you to be The Love Of Her Life, then small issues like borders and permits, can easily be overcome.   
There are enough US people here to prove to you that they can get a job, else you could both pop down to Germany, and try your options there.

If seen companies that ask for a CV with photo (Germany, 2011), age, date of birth, marital status etc. Being married doesn't mean you can't or don't want to travel. Neither does being single mean you can or want to travel. It's all a game about keeping the HR department happy to get you to an interview.

			Wow, i find quite surprising that there aren't HR jobs.... Bizarre. Perhaps you are looking for something quite specific?    
There is a Brevet Federal covering HR, but as others have mentioned, many start inHR from other areas. It could be interesting to convert your master in a Swiss credential, it may help employers to understand. They may worry that you are overqualified, and will either leave quickly or be too expensive, hence resulting in a waste of time.    
SAP HR would be relevant only if you love the technical work. It is a niche in a company, and even in the larger groups it lands you in a career with a relatively  ceiling. Even more relevant, SAP will not just train you... Unless you are hired by a consulting firm or by a company installing! You would need a customer number or vendor number to register in those courses. Of course there are 3rd parties...   "	5	 Jan 2012	0	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

			As has already been said, termination is very easy here in Switzerland as long as the rules are followed, and the only rule is termination period.   
Check also your contract because if it forbids any other work (without written persmission etc) then quite likely the notice period will be zero and you can find yourself out on your ear.   
If the organisation you are writting for is as you say it is, then maybe they have access to legal help, but I don't think it changes much.

			It looks like the question has been answered but you don't like the answer.    
NO company Swiss or not, big or small can guarantee you a permit as they are not the ones who make the decision. What is likely is that they already know how the process goes so they probably will have all the right papers, etc.    
Good luck.

			So far what I have found is that ""social work"" as a degree, and title does not exist in Switzerland. What falls under social work in North America, is broken into many separately defined, governed professions which each come from a different educational path. This makes job hunting difficult. I'd be curious to hear how other social workers have had their titles/educations translated or what equivalents they have been granted by swiss authorities -anyone?

			OK - reality check.    
If they were going to hire you, they will whether you send the mail or not. And if they decided you weren't right, they won't change their mind on the basis of the mail.   
So I think we can all agree that it will make no difference to the process - right?   
So in my mind there are only two reasons to send it.   
1. Politeness 
2. Political ""savvy""   
I'd suggest that there is no upside to politeness (they won't hire you if they weren't planning to anyway) and only downside (ie if Mirfield is the boss) - so don't do it for that reason.   
If its for more political reasons - wait until you get the answer. If you get rejected, maybe send a mail to the boss and the HR person saying ""got the letter. I understand I wasn't successful but loved you guys and was impressed by the company and if there is anything else suitable, would love to be considered""   
But bottom line is - it will make ZERO difference to the recruitment so don't do it for that reason.   
(And by the way - if you think that they are the kind of company for whom it WILL make a difference, don't join them)

			thanks guys.i'm learning more things from you. i appreciate all the help.    
yes, i know moving in lausanne might be too expensive for us without the job offer. that's why we're thinking of spending a day or two submitting our resumes until we got a reply for interview. we will only move once either of us got hired. would you think it's okay even if we live outside the city and no residence address in lausanne?   
@metallising - how we can go on applying to factories in  La Chaux-de-Fonds? I googled and it's near neuchatel? right now, i'm working part time as housekeeper-babysitter (jobs that don't require me to speak german or french). working in factories would be okay since it's an everyday job and i get the chance to learn french.    
i guess i'll also take fribourg as another option. there are lot of jobs here in where i'm living but it's more of seasonal jobs. we need to make a big move when winter season is over as there will be lesser or no work. we don't have kids yet so we will just mind ourselves. thank you so much! keep coming your suggestions.

			Hi Wisco,   
My situation has some similarities to yours. I'm also American and married to a Swiss native. We moved here after being in the US together for 8 years.   
I don't know how long you've been married, but you might consider applying for Swiss citizenship. If you've been married longer than 6 years, you can apply without having lived here. It could make finding jobs easier in some cases, but since you can get a work permit anyway, to most companies that might want you, it shouldn't matter at all.   
This is also a good Yahoo group for foreign spouses of Swiss:     
I would also not forget about your wife and the adjustment she will have to go through. Everyone's situation is different, but my wife is Swiss, grew up here, and yet would agree with much of what the ""nay-sayers"" are saying on here. If I told her we had to move back to California, she would probably have her bags packed before I finished the sentence.    
As others have said, I would definitely start learning German, after 3 years of that, and being frustrated that you feel more at home in Germany than here, you can then start on the ""local language"".    
I wish you the best in figuring out your situation. You'll learn something, no matter what happens.

Im evaluating a job offer to work in Lausanne as a salesman in the Assurances industry. 
I would love to move to Switzerland, however Im not sure about the contract conditions.   
There is anyone who can tell me what is usual to have in this type of positions? For instance: 
-	Very little base salary plus commissions? (by very little I mean to say insufficient to survive...2.000 CHF) 
-	How this kind of job is seen in Switzerland? Is it considered rewarding? 
-	Car provided by the company to visit clients?   
Many thanks in advance! Any tip will be important to formulate my decision.   
Cheers,

anyway..my manager is really giving me a hard time..he keeps saying this project is not important, is easy to manage etc etc..he's making me feel completely useless, but then..why did he decide to keep me? and why with a permanent contract? he could have extended it for other 3-4 months..ah, people are really strange.   
on top of that he has even told me (completely out of the blue) that in his opinion i am not really interested in working for this company and that the only thing i want is some stability (which in any case I think it is in the human nature) and this is the only reason why I want to stay there...

			The way that people are linked and networked these days, it's normally not too tricky to know someone from an HR company in a similar field to where you're looking and do some research.   
From what I understand, banks and insurance organizations have fairly rigid ""payment bands"" and are less likely to have people with the same age doing the same job with wildly varying salaries.   
I've always paid employees based upon their experience and quite frankly, directly linked to their ability to create revenue with new clients that I haven't had to spoon feed them.   
I know that there are some agencies out there who have contractors working for them making a killing, billing out treble or quadruple to the end clients against what they are actually paying their workers. Seems to be the case with short and medium contracts with banks and software experts, but also with other specialized fields such as aviation and hi-tech industries.   
Check out discussion and forum based websites for actual remuneration packages. Internet anonymity is a boon for discussing actual pay deals, bonuses and salaries in this day and age.    
Be kind of cool if EF were to have an open house policy and a section with salary discussions, no holds barred:   
Bank ABC needs a customer service clerk. Pitch yourself at CHF 7.5K, 13 month salary with pension scheme for example. Anyone brave enough to see if it would happen?

I would recommend using one of the online services such as jobs.ch, create yourself a profile in terms of the jobs you are interested in and then subscribe to a daily email containing jobs that match your requirements. Just waiting for a newspaper once a week is not going to be the best way to look for something.

			Thanks for all the replies.   
The reason I asked was because in the web page 1985 was shown as an example date in completing the form. I didn't want to look like a fool among fresh-faced 25 year old candidates.   
I always wanted to go back to school on my own terms, without having to worry about graduating so that I can find a job, etc.   
I relocated here with my husband (who is working), but since we are non-EU, with my L permit it is almost impossible to get a job. When I saw the ad for the PhD position I thought this might be a good opportunity to study in a really good university and   it like I always wanted.   
I don't think I will drop out as I tend to finish what I started and we don't have financial worries at the moment.   
Your replies encourage me so I think I will go for it.

Anyway, this job is gone. On to the next opportunity.   
Did you fall out with someone at your old company ? If yes, the usual trick is to ask someone senior at your old company to act as a phone reference for you. You then quote the names and numbers of these people in your application.   
You ask someone who likes you a lot, and thinks you are a good worker. Then you tell them what job you have applied for and that they should expect a phonecall. That way, they are primed and prepared to give you a very good telephone reference.

One is set for life to support the other. But wait, there is more to that.

			Hi David,    
The CELTA is a great qualification to have. Hopefully you will have great course tutors which will set such a high standard for teaching, that you'll find yourself thinking back to how they did things, as you start your teaching career.   
I found it challenging in the sense that there's a lot to do in not a lot of time (the 4 week course) but this also set me up for life as a teacher.   
As for job prospects, the CELTA itself, as said by Kristanez, will open more doors than other TEFL qualifications, and a better salary. Saying that, don't expect full-time hours at the beginning of your career... unless you take up classes with many different schools (but even then, it's unlikely at first).   
Enjoy it!

			When I was  let go  from my job I was told my position was being made  redundant . I was  laid-off  and now I am  unemployed  ... these are the terms that are used in the US, although the company where I worked is located in Geneva. Whatever the correct term is in English (whether it be BRITISH English or American English) the end result is the same ... YOU need to negotiate for as much as you can while they are deciding to end your employment.   
Another word I keep hearing in Switzerland is  fired , as in ""Did you hear that John was fired?"". In the US, this means that John did something so WRONG, like stealing money or sexually harassing someone, that the company FIRED him!!! This obviously is different from John being ""let go"" or being ""laid off"" or being made ""redundant"", yet whenever someone loses their job in Switzerland people tend to say that the person was ""FIRED"".   
My point ... language is an ever-changing thing and it differs from region to region (and from country to country), so even if your employer may or may not know the correct English word to use ... the important thing for you to remember is to focus on the bigger picture (and negotiate for as much as possible to help you get another job).

			I was thinking by now your investment punter out there would realise that all these schemes/policies since the 60's only make money for the sales people and those that manipulate the investments. 
We have had Unit Trusts, Endowments, Pensions, Investment Funds, Hedge Funds, Bonds etc etc.   
In fact I am surprised that the City of London and the financial centres of the world have any business left to do. 
I gather there are still a load of suckers out there; or perhaps they are just selling trash (""bundled financial investments"") to each other as they have been doing for the last 10 years and think they are making money.  Or perhaps it is like musical chairs but the opposite; when the music stops, you get hit with the loss.   
I sit here in disbelief that the FT100 is so high at 5,200 +.  I really thought it would be around the 3,500 max and ask myself why is this the case.   
Is it becuase the banks have off loaded their Toxic Debts (Bad Debts) to the government and got Government Bonds in exchange and used these as collateral to buy shares and hype the market or are there so many stupid (perhaps I will be proved wrong) punters buying shares doing the Bar....Bar.....Bar......Sheep Syndrome.

I am so glad to hear that. I have considerable interest in doing internship in Nomura or Mizuho Bank.

Actually I don't regard the salary thing as a crucial point of internship.    
Furthermore, I would like to know how the work environment is, i.e. proportion of employee's nationality and substance of work for internship.   
Incidentally, May I ask your nationality?

			Forgive me if this is obvious to you, but have you tried looking through the thousands of positions on   to see if there's anything that grabs your attention?   
Even if you don't meet the specific requirements, you may find something that helps you decide what is more to your taste.   
Do take into account that in your situation, nothing may really appeal. It's a bit like losing one's appetite after being unwell, and being long term unwell tends to destroy the appetite for work. Other people on EF have better knowledge than I do about coping with that and several other threads have a lot of good information.

			Switzerland's data protection laws are (as already stated above) compatible with EU data protection directives. They are also more stringent in some areas than the EU requirements, with the result that some EU companies choose to warehouse their data inside Switzerland for safety(*).   
To the OP: Without you paying my godawful ridiculous consulting fees I can't give a professional verdict, but a general rule of thumb is that your confidential data should only be available to people who have a legitimate requirement to view it to perform their duties. So what you describe does not seem, shall we say, quite correct.

The experience is something to trade on but reading your posts say that you are not that experienced in banking (yet).     In Switzerland, it is worth noting that the UN, chemical, Insurance industries tend to pay more than the banks (e.g. 30-50% more) so don't make the mistake that just because banking in London is the 'nuts' that it is here.  In Switzerland most of the banking contract job market (about 85%) is taken up by 2 banks UBS and CS and most of the work is in the private banking area.  Since private banking makes money and its clients are there anyway, they tend not to be installing the latest wonderful products because there is no need.  You may have heard of Calypso or Murex. I dont think a Swiss trader will have though.  (I standby to be corrected!).     In London, you, I suppose would be looking at 450-500 gbp pd contract and 60K salary.

			Commuting has it advantages and disadvantages like many things in life. As others pointed out if commuting by train you can read a book or the newspaper, listen to music or maybe even work. But you are bound to the train schedule. While this usually is not a problem in the morning, it can be very difficult to leave on time after work. It really depends on the job. If you just missed a good connection you might arrive home very late. Driving by car again depends on the job and the working hours. If you can beat the rush hour (for example be in the office at 7 am or 7.30 am the latest and leave at 4 pm or 4.30) it might be an option. If your working hours are not that flexible it might be very annoying and can stress you out completely if you have a meeting arranged and fear being late. So depending on the job a little flat or even just a room might be a better idea. This would give your husband the opportunity to work a bit longer days on the days that he spends the night in Zug which might allow him to leave earlier on Friday (again depending on the job). He could still come back once a week maybe . Furthermore a possibility to spend the night would also mean that he could socialise better with his working colleagues outside office hours which again, depending on the job, might be good for his career. Many people rent out their apartment during the week. Look for Wochenaufenthalter and also search for Einliegerwohnung (a separate apartment in a family house) as these people are often looking for a quiet person and therefore prefer a working family father over a student.

			Stephanie, from BB's link, perhaps the FBA (Fachspezifische berufsunabhängige Ausbildung) might be the way to go - or at least a good start.   
This is the less-intensive of the animal care courses, and it would allow you to work commercially in animal care (for fewer than 19 animals). This is not enough to work as a vet assistant, nor to   a Tierheim, but you'd be able to build experience in the field which might perhaps pique your interest in further possibilities.   
The FBA is a shorter course and includes an internship (unpaid I believe) in a Tierheim/kennel situation. This would allow you to set up your own pet care business or to work in (but not manage) a Tierheim/kennel.   
The Tierpfleger diploma is ca. 3 years - this allows you to manage a shelter or kennel. It is a more intensive course of study.   
Working in a vet practice usually requires a TPA, a 3 year degree/apprenticeship. This is perhaps akin to what in some countries would be a veterinary nurse.          
---   
Another possibility for further education that would probably not lead to job qualifications but would likely give you a great deal of personal satisfaction - and perhaps help pinpoint future career goals -  is to pursue independent courses/seminars on topics of interest.    
For instance, when it comes to dogs Certodog ( ) is a well thought of training institution - and one of the institutions certified to train SKN trainers if that is a goal.    
A foundation I very much respect is Animal Learn in Germany ( ).    
You could also look at distance courses from the UK or US if studying in English is a preference; you can study to degree level or take independent seminars. I can get you recommendations if you are interested.   
BUT these would largely be for personal satisfaction - to work in CH you'll most likely need the CH-specific credentials.     
----   
If you go the FBA route, may I ask that you post a few updates? I've been toying with the idea of doing the course - strictly personal interest -  but I fear my written German would not be up to snuff. I'd be interested to hear what others, especially expats who did not go through the CH education sytem, think of the course.     
Wishing you all the best!

Thanks for the feedback, both here in the thread and in the PMs.   
I turned the job down 3 times, and each time the recruiter came back... Looks like this time i'm going to accept it, mainly due to the uncertainty of future prospects in the current employment, and due to the pay rise (+16k base salary and +~10k allowances).   
This means that i'll be looking for a place to stay during the week (plan to keep the domicile in ZH until the trial period is over), any hints on that?

For many jobs/functions/qualifications the equivalent is not easy to find, or not the one to expect at first sight, since paths, competences and requisites are different.

			I think it only amounts to the equivalent of one months Sick leave in the whole time that you are registered with the RAV.   
Apparently, you need to also have your own insurance policy which kicks in after either one month or 3 months and pays out so much per day Tagesgeld (up to 2 years). This is optional.    
This costs a few grand a year. Usually you can continue your previous employers insurance, but the premium increases in relation to how ill you have been and can stipulate exclusions. Mine wanted 9000 CHF a year for 265 CHF per day cover (Allianz)    
This was my experience - it may depend on which company you worked for and health circumstances.

			1. Typically your notice period starts to count from the end of that respective month  irrelevant of the day you hand it in. E.g.  if you hand your resigntion today and have 2 months notice, your last day of employment should be 31st Dec. Your notice period is typically written on your contract.   
2. It depends on your earnings. There is a capping/limit to the 70% you are entitled to. This is usually based on the insured salary (but not necessarily your current salary)   
3. In Switzerland there is no law that prohibits you from working in more than one company. Hence you are free to look / join another company unless you have something specified in the employment contract

			I do not have any concrete tips, but I would try to send out open applications to companies that seem interesting to you. This worked best for me when I was looking for an internship 10 years ago.    
Also, ask your university, they probably have connections.    
In Switzerland, student internships are not as common as in some other countries and places are not always advertised, if they are you will be competing with many other people. However if you can add value to a company, make it clear to them what kind of assignments you can do. It is likely that somebody will give you a chance.    
For them it is a cheap way to get an educated person on board, if you do not live up to their expectations they are under no obligation to keep you after the agreed period of time, if they do like you they might make you an offer to stay. Anyway, good luck!   
PS I don't think you are too late. If I remember correctly, many friends of mine found their places very last minute. But yes, it can be stressful.

The problem is I do not have time to do a PGCE.  Taking 3 months out to do a CELTA is already enough as I have a family and we need the money!   
My degree is in French and Tourism, but there are no need for French teachers in Vaud.   
I have always wanted to teach, especially primary level and I have a small window of time next year...this is why I am going for it.   
Thanks everyone for their responses, they are really helpful.

			Hi all!   
I'm also in this position, I'm looking for a position in Information Security in Zurich / Winterthur area, since im moving there till the end of the year.    
I've worked 2 years has a System Administrator (Linux) / Web developer in a StartUp and 1 Year in Deloitte Portugal ( Enterprise Risk Services, Security & Privacy ) where I performed IT Audits, Security Assessments, Access Control & Role Management, and others. I did try Deloitte CH, but since I still don't know German nor French ( going to start learning soon ) there was no position available    
In terms of Certification, I have the LPIC-1 (Linux Professional) and ITILv3, and i'm studying for the C.E.H and maybe i'll do the OCSP (Offensive-Security Certified Security Professional)   
Any suggestions? I'm also considering starting in a different role, maybe in a Startup or IT Consulting, and see what I can find after I'm settled in Switzerland....

So maybe you want to crosscheck what your permit actually says - and maybe post it here for reference. Maybe it says that you cannot work for   but that is <> from       You  have a work permit, and if it runs out, the AHV becomes your de facto employer and your permit is renewed until your right to unemployment extinguishes.

This is my first time posting here and I've tried my best to adhere to the forum etiquette but please forgive me if there is a case otherwise.    
So I'm thinking of going for an MBA from a good Swiss university. I'm basically from an Engineering background and have around 1.5 yrs of IT industry experience. I hate IT and desperately want to change my field. My ultimate goal would be to find a job in Switzerland afterwards otherwise I might as well choose some other destination.   
How good are the job prospects here once you graduate from a local college? I'm a Non-EU citizen. Other foreigners in Switzerland here who might be going to a Swiss university, what have you seen usually? Do other international students on the campus end up finding jobs afterwards in Switzerland itself?

I just arrived in Geneva, Switzerland to live for two years while my partner is attending school for International Relations at UNIGE. The intent was for me to work and pay for things around here while the loans he had did the rest.    
I've looked on things like jobup and the marketplace here (thanks for that!) would any of you know particular companies or institutions that hire english speakers who do not have great french skills and are non-professionals. Seems most ""english jobs"" that are posted are professional only. I'm definitely ready to do cleaning or trash and I want to (trash collection or manual labor would be ideal and realistic), but I'm not sure where to find such service jobs or even if they would be posted. Any suggestions?   
Thank you.

			OP, there are 2 trail of thoughts in my head, depending on what your situation is.   
trail#1: if i'm a family man and that is my main source of income, i would just close my eyes and do my job for the sake of my wife and kid. i would sacrifice if at the end of the day it means that my kid would go to school and i would be able to support my family. if i can't do this then i would try to find a new job ASAP.   
trail#2: as a professional employed by the company, i would do my job the best way i can. here's a hypothetical scenario, say i need to do designs to market cigarettes to minors, i would do it the best way i can and make those minors smoke more.. reason being, is even a company that is doing something wrong, still have people who depend on it for their bread and butter and their families depend on them. 
either way, if i really can't stomach the business ethics, i would just find a new job and leave. at the end of the day, you should be able to go to bed with your conscience intact.   
that's what i think.

			OK, in the UK, if you've been employed for less than a year you can be sacked at any time as long as the terms of your contract are followed (unless the real reason for being sacked is because of your race, gender, disability etc) i.e. effectively as happened to the OP. You must however be given a written reason for your dismissal.   
After 12 months your employment rights kick in and you can claim unfair dismissal. 'Your work is great but our chemistry isn't' would probably be unfair dismissal.

If we look at the root cause of why there are not enough places of work, we can see that automation, computers and robots have taken our jobs and can perform today things beyond the imagination of past generations. Computer can do tasks more precise and for a much cheaper price than employing people to do it, and for a business its much more profitable. Have you heard about the  ?  
The corporations we created dont have feelings, and are profit driven. We should have learnt from the industrial revolution but the time is not lost if we enter the age of awareness.

			My wife landed a job (as a social worker) within 3 months, although she was not looking for one. She just wanted to take an inside look on how things were organised here, was showed around, and could not leave without a contract proposal. She signed a week later!    
The key: carrying an internationally accredited diploma, of which there obviously are not enough available locally.

			Hi all,   
I am moving to Zurich in a few and looking actively for a job there in the cosmetic industry/spa/beauty buisness.    
I have a master degree, several years of experience in major cosmetic brands and spas in Paris and New York, I am fluent in French (native) and English but my German is a little bit rusted so I'd rather go for an English speaking job.   
Does anyone know cosmetic companies based in Zurich? Head hunters with a beauty/cosmetic division? Spas? Any other tips to find a job is that field will be welcome.   
Thank you so much for your help!   
Cheers   
Nico

3398	Employment	Looking for a job in procurement	andreeac	722	0	zurich	09.09.2011, 12:48	" 
			
			Hello Everyone,   
I've moved to Zurich in May 2011 with my boyfriend (now he is my husband, we got married in August). I'm from Romania and I have an L working permit obtained only recently. I'm looking for a job in Procurement as a buyer/ procurement officer, any associate position. This is my main search but I'm also looking for assistant jobs, team assistant or personal assistant, or customer service jobs.   
I have a 5 years experience, in contract management (worked for 2 years at Oracle as contract specialist) and in procurement in another company, not so famous (worked for 1 year as a car fleet coordinator- I handled all the activities related to the company car fleet, contracts-acquisitions and for almost 2 years as a Procurement Officer - I handled all sorts of acquisitions for the company, organized tenders, conducted contract negotiations etc.)   
The main issue I have encountered so far in my job search is that I don't speak German. There are a lot of jobs in my area of search that ask for fluent German speakers. I'm only fluent in English and French and I manage current conversation in Italian. I have stared a German course but I'm only at the beginning.   
Finally, the point of this post is to put myself out there more. If any of you know any job opportunities that may match my profile, PM me with an e-mail address and I will gladly send you my resume.    
Thank you all for your time,   
A.

			Sorry on the language front forgot to mention I am an English speaker although I do speak good French and reasonable Hoch deutsch - probably would not have got the job otherwise.   
It is a requirement that you have good fluency in one and can understand the other. In principal everyone is allowed to speak his or her national language so you have a meeting where someone asks a question in French and the other person responds in German.   
Incidentally Swiss Germans are obliged to speak Schrift deutsch when French speakers are present and they are pretty good at sticking to this rule

Its arguably a better negotiating tactic which makes them ""declare"" first. I wouldn't worry too much about the wording of how much more as it could sound awkward...

			Hi there,    
Well this is my first post but hopefully I will become a regular user on here if my plan works out!    
I am currently living and working in Dubai but it's looking like myself and my boyfriend will be moving to Geneva shortly.   He has been offered a fabulous job and we're both really keen to move. The only issue I have is getting work. I've been a PA in large investment banks for the last 12 years or so. I have really good experience and never have an issue getting myself a job but i speak no other languages. (I'm British) I'm having French lessons to get the basics but i'm nowhere near conversation level. I'm doing ok though... anyway my question is this i guess... Am i dreaming thinking i'm going to get a job without French? and also... what kind of salary can i expect? I have a friend who has just moved out to Zurich and does the exact same job as me. Similar age and cv etc... she will be paid 85k CHF. But was told that anything between 70k - 110k is about right. This seems like great money?! More than what i am getting paid in Dubai!    
Any feedback would be great! good or bad too!

			Single person on 90k should have little or no problem living... I am supporting a family (wife & three kids) on only a little more than that, in Zürich... as others have said, look for public transport deals, cut back on eating out (a weekly grovery budget can be spent on a week's groceries, or one meal out...), and be smart with choosing your apartment - public transport is really good, and if you want to check travel times from different areas to your office, try   for a few tips... Unless you are moving large items (eg, furniture) around, you will probably not need a car. 
Of course, I don't know the US tax rates - but if you pay those, will you also need to pay Swiss taxes? And medical insurance - will your current medical cover continue while you're over here, or will you need local health insurance? Will your company cover 90% of that cost, if required? Also, will you receive assistance with relocation costs? If not, that will chew up a fair bit of your money...

Regarding whether you would deserve the salary for those two months or not that is up to debate.  It is rare that employees are effective and up and running from day one..    
Don't also forget that the Swiss love accurate CVs and will check and will ask for reference letters etc.  So any future employer might not be that impressed with your little two months adventure.

			Send me a PM and I will happily have a look After a number of years in IT management I have seen any number of entertaining CVs....    
The simple rule is that the 'words have to match the music'. If you turn up for interview on an impressive, but largely fictional, CV then it won't take any savvy interviewer long to realise that there is a mismatch between the person on the CV and the one on the chair.   
And although the temptation is strong to oversell oneself to ensure that one gets to interview then it should be resisted.... you will probably trying to punch above your weight and will be found out anyway. Largely because you will be nervous at interview, worrying that that you won't be able to carry it off.   
On the other hand... if you have successes to celebrate then don't undersell them. If you have stuff to be proud of, then be proud of it.....   
And, if you're in the job market. Good luck!!

Yesterday I got more details on how much was paid for my move (it just came up in conversation -- how fortunate).   The total for my move was ~20K CHF.   Half of that was for lump sum.  The other 10K was for the container + temp housing + the relocation assistance.   The company did not pay a deposit for the temp apartment, they merely took responsibility for any damages (which of course would have been passed to me) contractually.    
When I independently went to look for the cost of moving my things BACK with the same company, the price I was quoted was 10K.   So they obviously gave a discount to the company of some sort.  Which is something to consider if being offered a lump sum.      That will save you a lot, and flying with your pup in the cabin is so much more less stressful.  Have you traveled with him before by airplane?

I am a swiss-german speaking swiss who grew up in New Zealand and so aside from spoken swiss-german have no language skills in the four languages of CH. However for the last five months I have been in France learning french.    
My question is about getting an apprenticeship in nursing in the french speaking part of CH. Does anyone know about the process for this? Or at what times in the year one can start? (I realise that at the moment I might not have sufficient french language skills but am hoping that prehaps by the start of next year this will have improved somewhat) Also, I already have a Bachelor of Sciences in Anatomy from New Zealand.

			It might be possible to get a Project Management (PM) job with some smaller companies, where you also do a multiple other activities given your programming skills. Larger companies generally look either for some kind of experience in Project Management or some kind of certifications of the skills. Needless to say that the content of Project Management  differs on the size and professionality of the company, as well as the business they are in. A probable suggestion would be to get into programming and grow into a Project Manager, which may make things easier.

			I don't think it can hurt, so long as you do it nicely and make it clear that you are considering their offer.  They are aware that their contractors earn a lot more than the internal staff so 10% more than the base offer isn't like you're asking them to make you rich.  But like I said, do it sensitively as the people you are writing to probably don't earn all that much more than you were offered.  Good luck!

			Hi,   
In Switzerland what is the ""standard"" number of references an employer requires? Do they really ask for references covering your whole career?   
In England, my experience is that employers require 2 references - one from your current/last employer and one from the one before.   
Thanks

			Hi! 
I have not introduced myself properly yet, but I have a quick question, so I will ask it now regardless:   
I am doing an internship in a major engineering company (location: Zug), and my contract for is approaching its end. My last payslip (for the month of August) included a nasty surprise, because they have withheld a certain amount of money, writing the explanation ""Einbehalt Austritt"" next to it.   
I assume it is like a ""caution"", to make sure that I will actually appear at work for my last week? Could someone please confirm? Also, does anyone know when I am expected to get the remaining withheld amount of money (since I actually do intend to remain there, and unpaid at that, in order to my master's degree project with the department where I am currently completing my internship).   
(I guess that by reading that you have probably understood that I am student. Meaning, chronically broke.)

			Hi Guys   
Thanks so much for your comments.   
Yes the reason I would like monthly payslips is that I work part time for 3 different employers throughout the year and so calculating the correct amount of tax I should pay is a little bit of a nightmare.  Over the course of the year I actually pay too much Quellensteuer as it is taxed on your monthly income for that month.  Having payslips from each employer makes it a lot easier for the end of year accounts.  I get payslips from 2 of the 3 employers but the third is not being quite so helpful.   
Also as I work on an ad hoc basis without payslips it is quite difficult to see how much quellensteuer I have actually paid for that month.   
Thanks again for the comments, I guess I just have to ask my employer again, if they will give me a payslip.   
cheers

I have the option to be a ""no employee"" immediately (one week notice until the end of the test period), I don't have to wait three months.   
Generally notice period is to protect both sides, in Switzerland it is even often more for the employee (e.g. a lot of people who have to leave UBS don't even work their notice period, they just get money for three months).   
As for the benefit: In my case there is some if I stay because I am working on a project that is till November. So if I go now, they will have to find somebody to finish the project. Instead I can finish it and quit e.g. end of November. It's another question if HR will ever think/ask about that.

			Hello, 
I will soon transfer to a new company.    
Upon receiving my last pay cheque from my old employer, I see that my old company has reclaimed 100% of a training course fee from my last salary.  My training contract expressly states that 50% is due until my leaving the company.  The company is basing their argument to deduct 100% on terms and conditions that were ""allegedly"" discussed with the students before the course commenced.  There is no documentation to support their argument and I strongly disagree on principle. 
I have not received satisfaction and am forced to take legal steps. 
Is there a Small Claims Court in Zurich that can assist with such an action?  I believe this route to be appropriate as the amount is only chf 1k. 
Thank you kindly!

			Hi all 
My agent has asked me to consider a pay cut of 5% (contractor) as the client company is struggling with strong CHF until CHF is slightly weaker again and has assured me this is done for all contractors in company. When I asked him that I must come back from holiday to think about it (on holiday now) he threatened me with the 'alternative' which is presumably contract termination. Is he bluffing like most agents and if he terminates my contract is he not losing his pay cut too and losing his reputation (if such things exist for agents) with client company? He asked me to sign the new contract at the airport when I come back..

			Short answer: I worked for a MNC that is world famous for paying crap salaries... and 70k is what they paid to fresh graduate engineers without any work experience whatsoever. I guess you should not get less than 100k as a permanent and since you work as a consultant it should be a bit more.   
The problem is of course the low Euro. For 70k Euro can one hire a fairly experienced and well qualified engineer in Germany. So if you do in fact work abroad and your employer bills customers in EUR, you can probably not score as Swiss salary in return.

			In general work contracts in switzerland oblige the employee to assist the employer with reasonable amounts of overtime if needed.  However, there are special rules regarding public (religious) holidays and sundays.  You may find this reference helps, but I can't advise on a specific case.

3495	Employment	Lack of job, plenty of problems...	andreea_hara	6907	53	Fislisbach	17.03.2011, 10:33	"    It seems you're definitely filling your time in a productive way, and that is good  . In my experience, anything I applied to either online or by email was quickly rejected and the standard form letter would arrive stating my qualifications didn't quite match what they were looking for. Sometimes I received a phone interview, but then it was my language skills that were lacking. After a great meeting with an advisor at the RAV, I was instructed to only go in person to companies, as my in-person German was worlds better than over the phone (true  ). He also said to call ahead or research and find the name of the person whom I would ideally want to talk to- that way, when I dropped in with my dossier, I would have a name to give and make it past reception. I was usually able to sit for a few minutes with someone who was either in charge or able to determine if I was a good fit, even if they weren't advertising an opening. It really worked, as I was given an office job by a small clothing designer who needed an office assistant for a couple of months while his was taking an accounting course. He didn't want to advertise the opening as it was short-term and he didn't want to respond to so many dossiers. So I came along at the right time, and didn't have any competition for the job, so it was mine!   I've since worked in different restaurants, bakeries, and yoga studios, as those are my fields of study and experience- and every position was had by showing up with a dossier, a smile, and the name of someone to ask for. Maybe this could work for you?        Yes, that's a great idea! You could find out about opening a table/booth at the different local markets, such as the Saturday ones that are in nearly every town, and sell your desserts there.         The RAV could be perfect for you. They may not be able to help you find a job, but they should be able to help you take your German lessons for free. Mine also provided me a small amount for lunch and train travel reimbursement as the classes were not in my home town.

Zug has some decent hedge funds with maybe 2 or 3 quality firms. But most of the hitters in the industry are still in London or NY.

I was working 100% and then got a 50% sick note from the Dr. This meant I could take 2 days off and only  lose 1 holiday day.  By taking 25% of your holidays as sick leave you still have 25% of your holidays to use as you like (or in the allowed times!)   
The same rule applies when you're not pregnant too. Even if you are already on holiday, if you get sick and get a doctors note, they should change the holiday leave to sick leave so you can take your holiday later.

			There's Desperado in Bern and Mexican Bar in Boll, have you tried either (I haven't).   
OP, Switzerland can't be compared to California and visa-verso. If you are thinking of Switzerland, maybe visit first. Switzerland and Europe have a tremendous amount to offer, but if you are coming mainly for the salary without a high interest in the European experience, it might not work out for you so well.

This situation has actually just come up again. I've been offered an internship with a UN agency but one of the eligibility requirements is to be enrolled in university. The supervisor himself is not concerned whether I'm attending or not, but it is a UN-wide regulation that must be met.   
So I need to find a way to pay for courses in order to not be paid by an employer.... *sigh*

			Hello,    
I am a U.S. citizen currently obtaining my MBA degree at the best MBA program in Germany. I have 3 years of management experience as the Director of Operations for an international company in the U.S. and 1 year of additional product development experience with the same company.    
By the time I obtain my MBA degree, I hope to be able to secure a job in Switzerland, preferably in Zürich.    
Does anyone have any idea regarding the following?   
1. What is the likelihood of me finding a management job in Switzerland?    
2. What would be the average salary for someone with my education and work experience?    
3. Would it be difficult to obtain a work permit?    
I also speak near fluent German, fluent Italian, and limited French.   
Your help in answering my questions would be much appreciated!

			Just browsing the forum for this exact answer, so thank you.   
I applied for a postdoc at Basel Biozentrum over two weeks ago and despite having an acknowledgement saying 'looking at your application with particular interest' and 'will get back to you as soon as a decision has been made' I still haven't heard anything.   
Desperate to work (hausfrau life is driving me totally and utterly round the bend) and having had experience several times of being 'courted' for the position and then never hearing back again, or simply never hearing anything at all, I was starting to think I should give up and wait another 6 months for an appropriate position. But I'm feeling much heartened by this. Academics have their own way of doing things, after all.   
I do wish the same etiquette applied here as in the UK though, ie if you've taken the time to apply for a job you deserve at least to be informed you aren't being considered.

			First of all, a deep bow of gratitute to you guys for taking your time to read my silly questions       That is actually the problem: he hasn't gone to the RAV. We noticed he got into tough financial problems, basically because he was not counting on the missfortune of getting fired on the first month of his new employment. We talked to him about it, but it just turned into a screaming ""end of discussion"".      Yes, that makes sense in the same line like swissbob. I will try to find out what's the situation right now and what are the possibilities to ""freeze"" his self-employment.       
The whole situation makes me look like a meddling hag.   Proud, independent men sometimes are really difficult to help, because they refuse to accept they are in  of help, though it is quite obvious to outsiders. I'm just testing my ground here, so I can make a stand and fight for his happiness without getting the relationship cut.   I'm a selfish bitch: I care for him and, for my own sake, I want him to get on his feet. BLEH...

I guess nobody will tell you that you MUST learn German and will give you any deadline but it's really helpful and people appreciate when even when you don't speak their language you make the effort to learn. And, of course after some time, when your language skills are good enough, it's always nice to put it in your CV, don't you think?   
Job agencies? I'm not sure if we talk about the same thing but I just found the nearest agencies in my city like Manpower, Randstad, registered online, went personally, not only to find job offers but to ask for advice about my resume, if there is anything more I can improve.   
And the last but not the least: there is a lot of people on EF from India, I guess they can help you much more. But I believe when you will do some research here, you'll find a lot of useful information and answers to all your questions.

Your local RAV office may be a good starting point to look for someone to give you legal consulting on this - e.g. in Basel the authority that runs the RAV give free legal consulting on such questions. I could imagine that your canton has similar institutions.

			It sounds a lot like the US where, when I was laid-off late last fall, I was given a severance, a parachute and some perks of a job finding service, etc...some of which was bound from the original company which was acquired by the current company. The catch of the whole deal was that I had to sign a rather lengthy legal contract stating that, in addition to my needing to honour the NDA for 2 years, that I would have to return the severance if I found a new job in the company in 90 days or less. Didn't you have to sign something? Maybe you should re-read it just to be sure.   
Of course, suing you is likely more than it's worth, but they might punt you which could be a problem in terms of getting a job here as Zurich seems to be a real small place.

However, some agencies have blanket contracts that are tied to the level of the employee. E.g. Band 3 equals a daily rate of 1K. So in order for these firms to get a rate increase the guy would need to proceed to the next band. BUT, there is a cap per department on the number of employee's per band so it's pretty difficult to get much of an increase.

			Hi All,   
I've been through alot of postings that were helpful to my query but many were quite old and none address fully my situation. I'd really appreciate any help that you might be able to give me as I have just landed in Switzerland.   
My situation is a little complex. I am an Irish national and have spent more or less the past 8 years working in France but finished my job last year and have not worked there this year. I accepted a contracting role in Switzerland last month having been recruited through an Irish based umbrella/recruitment company.    
As part of my deal my accommodation and expenses are being covered in Switzerland but my salary is payed in Euro and linked to my irish social security number. I will not be living in Ireland nor will I be working there but I will be processed through an Irish company who have told me they don't mind where my receiving bank account is. I am single and independent so I am happily moving everything to Switzerland (the contract is 6 months extendable).    
I am really not sure where I should be paying tax, but I do know that France would probably be least favourable out of the 3 potential countries. Ideally I think I should set myself up as a resident tax payer of Switzerland. I am of course taking professional advice (in all 3 countries!) but would seriously appreciate any tips that people might have from their personal experiences or even if you could recommend particular professionals in Switzerland who could help me with this.   
Thanks.

My remuneration package was not affected, but various other things were, for example, the class of travel I was permitted to take for long distance flights (quite important when you are taking 12 hour overnight flights and going straight to work!).   
However meaningless a title may seem to be, it's a fact that something like this feels humiliating and like a demotion. Recognition is a hugely important part of motivating and rewarding employees. There is nothing wrong in feeling like you do.    
In my case, and I suspect in yours too, there is nothing you can do about the title or grade as long as it does not affect any money or benefits in your initial contract. But long term it could have an impact on things like bonuses (some companies have fixed %ages of salary that they will for bonus at each level), holiday, etc. I swallowed my pride and got on with the job which I enjoyed, but it motivated me to perform to the higher standard that I thought I deserved and made me feel less loyal toward the company. I had no qualms moving on when I felt I had achieved all I could in that role and something much better came along. And I learned what questions I needed to ask when moving into my next job!   
Sorry this probably isn't an answer you wanted to hear, but hope it helps a little.

It's quite normal to agree that you stay three years after the end of the paid education (depends on the costs for the employer). If you leave your job 6 months short you have to pay back 6/36 of the costs.

She CAN""T fulfil the job as she won't be there for the required time to do it and this is something she knew BEFORE the contract signing not an un-forseen circumstance! No-one is suggesting for a second she should be excluded from the job market... more to the point she should stop booing about being caught out and trying to seek recompense from a situation she was fully aware of.

In Switzerland you are paid more than in France, however that's it. After 12 months you are entitled to uneployment pay for 12 months.    
If you have been working for 4 years you will be entitled to 18months uneployment pay, notice period is then 2 months.

3579	Employment	Any insights on Risk Management roles (entry level) at Zurich?	GreenEarth	1296	0	Canada	28.06.2011, 18:21	" 
			
			Hello everyone,    
I would really appreciate some insight as to the following (or any part of the queries that you may know about):    
(i) What would be the best qualification to have in order to enter the risk management field (entry level - ie no previous risk management experience) in Zurich.    
(ii) Are there many entry level (no previous risk management experience) in Zurich?   
(iii) Is GARP or IRM (please see below) more recognized in Switzerland?    
I am currently looking to pick up Risk Management quaifications; and the 2 options that I have seen are:    
- The International Certificate in Banking Risk and Regulation (ICBRR) from GARP (Global Association of Risk Professionals). A Certificate of Completion is awarded by the Global Association of Risk Professionals with passing exam score    
- The International Certificate in Risk Management or Risk Management in Financial Services from The Institute of Risk Management (IRM)   
- I would ultimately be obtaining the Financial Risk Manager (FRM) from GARP.    
My experience has been in the banking sector, currently as a Process Analyst in one of the top 5 banks in Canada.

I've done it, it is possible. You must be an EU or Swiss citizen, moving to an EU country and have been collecting RAV for three months.

It's a position in a hospital, and I have already worked 2 years in  Switzerland in a similar job (sadly I quit just before being eligible  for a B permit- thought we were going home, until my partner got an  excellent job offer) 
There are Swiss/EU people who can perform this job, but they have less specialized training than myself. 
And yes, as far as I know, they were fully aware that I don't actually have a work permit anymore, and would need to get a new one.

			Hi    
Welcome on here, you seem to have a lot of experience in various high end jobs, i would start looking now because u will have a better chance now to sus out work and get a feel for the market and all that now for when you come over, if your not successful that is in finding a position before you leave. I am a golf professional from irelandand i looked around the golf industry and did not get much back so as regards that and, for the summer, i will happy doing any kind of job, it was better for me to come over here and look for that sort of work hands on here rather than over the net. so far, thru here aswell, iv gathered some contacts and have picked up a part time job thru iv come in contact but i think with your experience you prob will have more luck chasing a position down over the net or email and phone as those type of positions will be readily advertised over the net, i think!! plus you have loads of time till you get here so why not!   
hope this helps

3600	Employment	need info as how to apply for jobs	sirishasudhakar	810	1	zurich	21.06.2011, 17:22	"    First you need to build a CV. I advise you to look at this site, which has wonderful tips and a great skeleton:         After you put your CV together, you need to find a job   
- check newspapers; 
- check job agencies like  or  ; 
- post your CV and profile in online sites in your field (for example   is very good for IT) 
- etc;     Have your CV ready as a printed version and PDF just in case people contact you by email.   
It is very useful to have a nice email to add on your CV and job application. Something not        If you apply directly, make a nice letter like (in German/French/Italian depending on where you live/apply):   
Dear Sir/Madam,   
I saw on NEWSPAPER X DATE HERE you are looking for a new JOB. I believe I am well qualified for this position because I AM AWESOME. Please take a look at my attached CV for more information.   
Looking forward to hearing from you in the near future,     
Sincerily yours,   
XOXO     Wait for a response (by email or job agency). If you get an interview, it is important to take you CV, look ""presentable"" and confident. They might ask you for credentials (like school or previous employers), so take them if you have them.     I take that, though you have no work permit, you do have a living permit, since you are dependent (or have I missunderstood?). Once you found someone willing to give you a work (it is important to mention on interviews you do not have a work permit yet!), they will take care of getting it for you. The whole shebbang can be read on other threads.   
Good luck

A lot of clients love boxing as you can't get it in a gym so much, its high cardio therefore good for weight loss7 fitness and plus you get to beat 10 bells out of someone..... releving stress!!   
Great exercise! good to hear PT is working for you and you sound like you enjoy it too!

Macarena, I would suggest that you try the cantonal hospital employment pages and the individual clinics.

3634	Employment	Help me mobbing my colleague!!!!	Praktikum	6519	55	Zürich	10.05.2011, 19:17	"    Ok, so that blows my theory out of the water. Apologies to any Swiss who might have been offended...       No. You post it on the local COOP notice board... Of course you show it to your management. It is much easier to make any sort of accusations when you give specific details of ""mobbing"", i.e. date, time, exactly what happened (note stick to facts), include as much detail about what was said and who witnessed it (if any) and why the situation was uncalled for or any accusations unfounded.    
Mobbing I have read about, all here on EF (see links below) have been based around belittling colleagues/ subordinates  in front of other colleagues, accusations of bad/poor work and accusations of not meeting goals/deadlines/objectives.         
Do you know how to sue a company for being forced to leave due to mobbing and/or ill health as a result, loss of earnings etc.?   
If you do, then you don't need a lawyer. But I'm guessing from your thread here, you don't. In which case, you'll need a lawyer.

3640	Employment	Seeking some advice	Ruffian1386	1203	7	New York	01.06.2011, 23:46	"    You answered your own question here. Many people come, or plan to come, wearing rose-coloured spectacles. The anglophones think everyone speaks English. The country has a reputation for being well-organised and clean. The locals are sure to be friendly and it would be great to learn to ski... Then the prospective newcomer starts looking for a job - and the employers aren't always in agreement about the value of the job-seekers qualifications or whether a permit will be forth-coming.    
Then comes accomodation. Most people here live in rented flats - a shock to home-owners from other countries. In said flats, washing machines may well be shared by many occupants, and the rota may, or may not, function satisfactorily. The locals are perhaps not quite as welcoming as the people connected with the tourist regions were. And in the German speaking part of Switzerland, the German one might have learned at school will help you to read the newspaper but will not guarantee that you can communicate with your neighbour. And the 'well-organised' comes at a price. Every canton makes many of its own rules and each village adds a few more. And of course, you, too, are expected to stick to them. All of them.  Even the ones written in tiny writing on the back of the paper or perhaps not even written down at all.   
I've lived here for ages. I love it. I wouldn't really want to live anywhere else. But folk who come all starry-eyed - stars caused by being madly in love or by the thought of high wages here (which are countered by high prices anyway) - often come down to earth with a nasty bump.

I am worried to provide the best to my family (in terms of environment, safety and family economy) and that's why I am looking into Switzerland.   
And I have no problem with changes, whatsoever, nor do my family       Again, I am not trying to escape from work. I get my things done. If anything shows up a minute before 5, I attend it and finish it (if it's a short activity or urgent). If it's something that requires an hour or so, forget it. I never said I cut my work and leave it to someone else. Please stop dragging words into my mouth that were never intended.   
What's wrong with you people? Seems like you're suffering from this at your workplace.. but seems I also messed up describing the problem specifically.   
What I meant is, I start at Xam and finish by Ypm and I leave, ending my activities for the day, but if there are more, sorry, but will end up by tomorrow (if it has been a very-very-very busy day). I can't work at 120% with no time to even pee, all 8 hours (or more), can you? If you can, wow, you must be the perfect employee.   
Sorry for the sarcasm, but it's the way it is.      Holy crap.. not again..   
It is true though, everything else, and thanks       Thanks!       The employer MUST know that you have a family and that he owns part of your life, but not all of it! That's how I see it.      Thank you.

			Hi there and welcome to the Forum,    
You could try hanging up some ads in the Coop and Migros (I am a German teacher and I have found a couple of students this way).  Make a habit to start reading the ads in Coop and Migros that others hang up - you may find students in this way (has also worked for me).   
Another thing I have done is to hang up ads at all of the Universities, libraries, etc, in my area.  You could try that too.  (Do ask permission first before hanging up an ad at a University, but they normally say yes!)   
You could also try this website:      I can't comment on the success rate of finding students on this website, as I use it to network with clients related to the other part of my company (document translation).   
Your own website down the track might help, for people looking for English teachers in your area...  I have my own website and many of my students/clients have found me with a google search     
Good luck with it all!

That language is sought for, has future, people usually do not go into Russian classes just because of some romantic ideas or travel plans. So, for Russian I would charge more than for, say, Croatian. Sorry, if the reasoning sounds discriminatory.    
Also, be aware, that private language schools usually do not pay so much, compared to local schools, or, high profile language agencies.

			Mmm - interesting reply . . I guess I should have expected it. 
However I appreciate your point of view. 
In any case . in answer to your question: 
I wouldn`t say that visiting prisoners is the BEST use of my time but I do feel (through the experiences of my family being involved in these type of things) that there are many people serving out their debt to society, who have no family to visit them. 
They are paying for their crimes by being incarcerated - but surely re-integration can begin before their release. I`m not sure that visitations is that much of a luxury for prisoners but maybe isolation can lead to a more insular and potentially antisocial character - therefore maintaining or rebuilding some sort of normality prior to release could be a good thing. 
Actually I believe in many worthwhile causes, I can assure you and I admire anyone who supports them either passively or actively . 
In any case - `Those deemed unfit for freedom, due to their own actions` is true but very general. What I mean is that there are people in prison for a huge range of crimes. I remember a while back in the UK, some guy went to prison for selling fruit in Pounds and Ounces instead of the official Kg .  
Thanks for your comments anyway.

3667	Employment	Contracting in Switzerland - Let the Naive Beware!	IanSmithUK	6361	67	London, UK	14.05.2011, 13:06	"    I think that can be very dangerous and doesn't tell the whole story (quite aside from the fact it can be difficult to research contract rates for specific roles - people don't like talking about what they're on).    
Time and time again the UK agency told me they had ""loads of other contractors on the same sorts of rates working in Switzerland"" (although for my rep this was his first Swiss experience) and saying I should speak to one of them to get reassurances. I keep asking to speak to one of those contractors - but for some reason it never happens      
On my visit the only Brit I did meet on the team I'd be working with lived in France. For him this was a relatively easy commute at weekends and so he was happy to cope with ""serviced accommodation"" during the week. There was a French guy there as well and when I asked him it was the same story. He lived on the border in France.   
The reality is everyone's situation is different and the only real way to work out if a contract is right for you is to compare your existing costs and income with those on offer and decide if they're acceptable.

			I was in Zug last year for two weeks on a language course, but as I had classes everyday and didn't get to travel a whole lot, mainly as activities involved going swimming usually. So this year (I'm 17 now) I'd like to go back to Zug but get a job and stay in a youth hostel or an apartment. My German (Hochdeutsch) isn't particularly good, nor bad, but it's enough to get by easily enough.   
The main reason for going over is to improve my German (Even if it's Swiss German), and possibly to get some money for college next year.   
I remember walking past an Irish pub last year in Zug, anyone know the name of it?   
If anyone knows of any jobs that are available in Zug I'd be delighted if you'd share them    
Bern would be a nice option too, but that's supposedly almost impossible for a non-fluent German speaker to understand    
EDIT: It would be for about 2 months. How did I forget to mention that. I'm hoping to do Mechanical Engineering next year so somewhere like that would be nice, but I'd be more than happy to work as a barman or something.

It was only when I sat down with her and showed her a comparison of her productivity versus the rest of the team that the message: ""you are not pulling your weight, the team requires people to perform at a certain level. Shape up or ship out"" sunk in. The message was further reinforced with a mini-review with certain KPIs for her to meet in within the next 3 months. Was her choice on whether to throw in the towel or rise to the occasion. You'd be surprise how much faster some peopel move when a fire is lighted under their arses - and how dispensible they can be.

I'm pretty familiar with the terrible Geneva housing market, but I'm willing to live farther out and commute.  I'm already commuting more than an hour each way a day, so that is not a problem.  On a bad traffic day, commute might be two hours ..  I wish I were kidding.  I understand the pros and cons of the situation.   
That said, I will definitely get a job *before* coming out -- that way I don't have to worry about the permit issues and can maybe get housing assistance as well from the employer.  If no housing assistance available I'll be living out in the countryside and commuting.

			That is more between your current and future employer than for you. Certainly, it may be awkward for your to consult with your current employer... but it has been seen in case of special skills.   
I would not move nor take any decision before you have a firm contract signed in your hands. The concept of ""after a little time join us"" would make me nervous - are they planning to pay for that ""little time"" unemployed? you should ask for a sign-on bonus to compensate for that, or for contracting work for a period of time. Also, during that time you would be without accident insurance (normally covered by employer) and possibly needing an interim health insurance.    
Best to discuss openly, with a contract lawyer (new company should investigate there), and eventually with your current employer when you are ready.

The rental prices usually state a basic for the apartment, plus the service and utilities charges, which is usually about  . Included is your share of all the heating, hot water, building maintenance, gardening, fresh water, house lighting, lift service, Cable TV, communual rubbish. On top of this you will have your own electricity bill which is about CHF 80 per month. Plus the famous Billag TV license.    
At the end of the accounting year you will get a statement declaring how much they owe you, or how much extra you have to pay.    
Often a landlord will advertise a flat as 1'500 inclusive. Then you find out from the contract he is charging CHF 1'350 rent plus CHF 150 for the extra costs. But at the end of the year he presents a bill for CHF 1'200 extra, extra, costs as his estimate of CHF 150 was far too low.

3720	Employment	Tips on where to find useful work experience near Bern	lewibrfc	1928	3	bern	21.04.2011, 00:55	" 
			
			Hello OP,   
I note now I have seen the full title is work ""near Bern"" - I still considered somewhere like Zurich when writing my email as ""near Bern"" although possibly not ideal I don't know your full situation.   
I haven't any personal experience directly related to your experience but I feel a little more positive for you than what I have read so far. Although you may not ""be let free on any companies accounts"" just yet, I would think you stand at least a chance of employment in the financial sector which would at least tie in a little to the area of work which you suggest you will look into in future.    
A few things in your favour - when I was looking for a job I saw a lot of internship positions, there are more of these than in the UK I have found due to the structure of the employment / education system here. Although not going to a Swiss institution you may still stand a chance. Your strong German along with your English mother tongue will be a great asset - really highlight your language ability. I am thinking UBS / CS as companies where I have seen internship positions before.     
I would try and avoid mentioning things that highlight that you intend not to return to Switzerland as I think as others have pointed out this is a strong negative point. What is it your permit situation as another poster has asked - I can see that you have already been working here so is it a B permit?. Maybe you could though look at a few of the big companies that have offices in the UK and Switzerland, you could spin it that you want to return to the UK office afterwards and this may work out in your favor.   
It isn't the end of the world taking other roles and as other posters states, all job experience is good experience, you just need to sell it to others on your CV at a later date. I have sold ferry tickets in the past and this has given me great experience in dealing with difficult customers (and other good points) but doesn't directly relate to anything I have done since.   
To sum up, widen your search to the whole of the financial sector (I have suggested this due to you stating about the accountancy firm and possibly this is a direction you wish to take) and you may find something that is of more interest to you and possibly tie in with moving back to the UK. Financially you may not get great money and would involve traveling to another Swiss city other than Bern (I have a collegue who managed traveling daily from outside of Bern to Zurich for a period of 6 months - so can be done).   
Best of luck and don't give up, finding employment here is a harder / slower process than in the UK as you probably have already found out!

I don't like the way the healthcare works in Switzerland. I don't like being forced to buy health insurance. It's not part of the dream. They are trying to implement this in the US and I think it is a mistake. We need universal healthcare, no more insurance companies.    
I love isolation. I don't want a large house, 2 bedroom is more than enough but I would love a garden.    
It seems I am stuck because I want to live in the country but I don't want to commute to a job and I can't legally live anywhere without a job. I would probably have to give up my kushy CA lifestyle to move to Europe. Not sure if it's worth it.

			From my knowledge, there are two types of B-permits.  One attached directly to your employer, one that is not.  If you have the one that is not, then immigration will extend your B permit as long as you are elible for RAV payments. This I know from experience, unfortunately it was from 2003, so perhaps things has changed since then though it does not make any sense if you are eligble for RAV benefits  but are not allowed to stay and receive it.   
Regarding the other type of B - I can not help as I am not so sure how that goes.  I agree that RAV will be the best place to get the correct answers and will recommend you reach out to them before going to immigration.

			In the end it has never got me a job but I did tried a few 'spontaneous application'.    
Yes, applying to advertised jobs are much more straight forward (i.e. higher chance) but my advisor at ORP (or RAV) told me I should try.   
All I can say is that you should address it to the real person whenever you can (by using your personal connection or even Linkedin) to maximise the chance of your application is actually examined rather than is thrown in the bin.    
A head of department is a best bet but I once tried to send it to a staff level person (got to know from my friend's connection) and ask him to pass it to his boss (he did replied to me with sorry).   
During my days of unemployment (23 months!), I did send some addressed to HR with nearly no response. But the ones addressed to a head of department (with or w/o real name) did result in a few responses.    
Of course some people might just pushed it back to HR to let them say no to you but at least the fact that someone got noticed your application is not a bad thing at all.   
Any advice given to you may all sound like 'theory' but there's no silver bullet on job hunting. Addressing to HR or even cold call may lead you a job you want. You never know until you try and you just need to keep trying.....   
Good luck.

I also have a friend (from the same family) who is severely dyslexic and he is in the vocational strand of upper secondary education, which includes work placements... and he has already found a possible apprenticeship as a gardener.      I am trying to get some links to open which have some information about that kind of training in Vaud... but Chrome is throwing a wobbly and is just not willing to co-operate.    
If you search for an internship (stage in French, Praktikum in German, tirocinio or stage again in Italian), on jobs websites, there are jobs which come up... but I don't know how easy it is for a foreigner who hasn't gone through the system to access them.       For me part of the problem was that I was trying to get a qualification recognised here   - no-one had ever applied to do the role I wanted to do with the qualification I had. So we got bounced between two organisations as they tried to decide who had the responsibility of investing my equivalency request. Then there was the language issue. And then, because my field was childcare, the need for additional training to adapt my knowledge to Switzerland. Not that I got that far...

			Hi All   
Does anybody have experience working for an employer in the US, whilst living in Switzerland?    
Looking for advice regarding social security numbers and tax exemption. Feeling a little confused...   
My primary question is whether I need to request something an ITIN? Or whether I can simply use my AHV number to complete the W-8BEN form?   
If I do need to get an ITIN, what is the quickest and easiest way to obtain one? Through a consulate, online, etc.?   
Also, are there additional forms to complete so that I don't end up paying taxes, etc. in both countries?   
Many thanks in advance 
Chris

			Be glad you are saving something. Go with the other posters advice. Have a good look at your expenditure. We are currently on a a lower single income than yourself. After rent, Creche bills, health insurance and tax there is not much left.    
The heath insurance is a biggie. Use   to see if you can get much better deal whilst not downing your coverage too much. It's in English and it is worth the struggle.   
Usually you can only switch at the end of the year November I think. Still you can see how much you can save next year. We switched last year and got similar coverage and saved 500 francs.    
There is also the obvious things like Migros Cumulus and Coop's supercard schemes for getting points on your purchases. We are a family of three and with what we spend in Migros over three months, we get back the equivilent of one weeks shopping in vouchers. Just a note do not spend these vouchers on 10 times the points events as anything paid for by vouchers does not accumulate points. Migros catches out a lot of people that way as they send the vouchers out just before they have 10x the points events.

3765	Employment	IT Agencies for English jobs	guest	2619	16	null	1.1.0001, 00:00	"    Hmmm.. You know: Switzerland is a fairly small country. I am here for six years by now and have changed my job twice. As it happened, I met the same headhunter over the years at three different agencies - hiring seems to be one of the industries with the biggest turnover. So I do not think it is smart to even attempt this for several reasons: 
- There is no way I would hire you if I find out you behave so unethically. I would not expect you to be a loyal employee and I think your moral compass is so broken that I would not trust you with any confidential stuff my competitors would like to know. Headhunters and clients talk... so they do find out sooner or later. 
- If you plan to stay here longer, the chance is high that you will be looking for another job in two or three years. You have a fair chance to run into the same consultancies and people again then...  
- and karma comes in a full circle...   
On a side note: 105k CHF a year is nowhere near ""executive"" for Zurich standards. Nothing under at least 150k is. Any agency actually talking to people of that level is not doing ""executive search"" - they use the term to look professional, nothing else. Its a bit like ""luxury"": If you need to write it in your advertisement, you probably aren't... otherwise it's obvious.

			You may wish to consider the US or UK as alternatives. Employment opportunities for candidates  with your academic/research background are in great demand, in industries you'd never imagine possible. In fact, I know of a Ukrainian who had an aeronautical degree from home, transit into finance after getting a US MS degree in quantitative finance. I am not familiar with the German PhD system, but in the US, you have leeway. In fact many of my classmates were either PhD drop-outs in physics/computer science/engineering or PhD holders.   
Also, this may be cliched but you need to focus on your core skills when you present yourself on both the CV and cover letter. You mentioned marketing, well think of how you would 'sell' your profile to the potential employer, find out about the industry/company and consider how your background could potentially be invaluable. Research and be creative!

			Hi Clairey,   
I've usually seen this work in the following way:   
1) Candidate goes to his current company and states that his new potential employer is offering a buy out hence what would be the expectations from the current company.   
2) Candidate relays information from point 1 to Recruiter and New company. If acceptable all is good.   
3) If Point 2 is not acceptable then there has to be a discussion to come to a reasonable arrangement between both employers.   
Usually Swiss contracts just state the notice period but do not state any amount that needs to be compenstated in Lieu OF. Of course in some situations the contract states that the candidate has to return things such as Joining Bonus, Part of the Relocation costs etc.. which he was offered when starting with the his current employer if leaves in XX months. (Usually 12 - 24 months)   
Hope this helps.      "	36	 Aug 2007	2	['0', '0']	['7', '7']	2

Finding a teaching job in the public sector (state schools) is harder for an American than a Brit because of politics.  Being Swiss nationalized will help the situation.

			I think the best idea in any situation where you will need to travel for an interview is simply to ask before anything is booked how the costs are handled, if you are expected to pick up the bill or if they cover the cost and if so what exactly is covered.    
For example, flights, train/tram to the offices, overnight accomadation. Also if they agree to pay for something, is there a budget?    
In my opinion is crazy to pay and jump on a plain without even knowing if the company will cover the costs, unless your willing to pick up the bill in case they dont.

I too work in finance and a recent report from our company in London indicated something like a 70% increase in work volume whereas in Switzerland about 25% - the section in London is seriously understaffed   
If you like PM me and I'll provide company details   
as ukal123 said London is the better place to look (if you are not bothered about location) also being an EU citizen you should have minimal problems compared to Switzerland

			This is not the part of the forum to actually look for the job itself anyway. Job Ads belong in the Market Place and you are not eligible to post there yet. Here you can look for advice and tips - but it seems that really no-one has anything for you so far. Wait a bit, maybe someone will come along with other sites.    
Do check up the sites which are already given in the Employment Forum though. Folk who do a bit of looking themselves and say what they have found, are more likely to get help from members on here. Don't forget that we get requests like this every day and most of us are not at the 'hiring' end of jobs. This is a forum for helping expats living here or planning to come - in all aspects of living here - not just a place to search for a job.

			embo - i think you will find that a lot of agencies and employers do realise that things are done slightly different...i suspect that just standard stuff like length of service are required. I recall arguing/debating with an agency when I was offered my current job...the new employer wanted reference and certificates...I explained that normally certificates are NOT given (I was in the UK earlier). When the agency wanted to speak to my last employer in the UK I warned them that they would only get basic information - and thats all they got. it varies from country to country but some cannot legally give a 'bad' reference. I think here in Switzerland they CAN give a review on your performance legally

A good head hunter won't place someone unless it is a good fit for the company and you.  Just through sheer number of attempts, I found a firm who was very knowledgeable of my industry.  I basically made friends with the partners first, wining and dining them.  They were savvy in American business culture, and a pleasure to hang around with.  They sent a couple of openings to me, the first few of which were duds.  After about 18 months, they sent one that was a perfect fit.  They worked it hard, and I got what I was looking for.  I think persistence is key to finding a job, and good relationships.  If you don't have good relationships in Switzerland, start building them now.   
If a recruiter in Switzerland put an effort into placing the OP, I'm sure they can find a position for her.  I think her language skills are marketable nowadays, assuming she has the educational credentials.

			If you really are thinking   - broaden your search. If you live/work anywhere in Europe long enough to gain EU citizenship, all your Swiss visa-chasing becomes a piece of cake.  You still have a job to look for, but any company can take you on without proving they have exhausted all CH/EU hiring possibilities first (which would be your situation now, as a non-EU national.)   
I imagine it's also (somewhat) easier to look for a job here even without EU citizenship if you are based on the same continent, plus or minus one time zone instead of six, can easily come for interviews etc.

			If you register to live and work here you will need to follow Swiss employment laws and compulsory deductions for tax, health, pensions, 3rd party liability insurance, etc.  If you are employed by a Swiss company, or the UK company has a registered subsidary office here, you will have to register and get a work permit.    
Generally these forced deductions are less painful than UK rates, and we do have a higher standard of living. Unless you are registered as living and working here, with a permit, you won't easily get an apartment. You might however be able to ""illegaly"" share one.

			Hi,   
I'm not an ergotherapist... but I am a patient at a psychiatric hospital who attends ergotherapy on a regular basis.   
I was talking to one of the ergotherapists (who runs the ceramics workshop) and I asked her how she came to know about ceramics. (I was curious because it seemed to me that it required more specific skills than some of the other workshops). She told me that she trained as a ceramist   she trained as an ergotherapist, which would seem to indicate that there is a difference. I don't know if that helps.    
At one point I was interested in re-training in the field myself and when I talked to the team about it they told me I would need to do the 4 year course ( ).    
If you like I can ask someone for clarification the next time I go to ergotherapy... unfortunately the ceramics ergotherapist is in the States on a language course at the moment but one of the others might be able to help!

Hopefully you aren't going to the interview to beg for a job. You are interested in the employer, and the employer is interested in you. You both have something to offer each other. So now, you have shown up at the employer's office at their request, instead of them coming to you, so you both can evalulate whether you two would be a good fit for each other. Because you are the one traveling to see them, the assumption here is that they should at least pay to cover your cost - no more, no less.   
People go wrong when they believe that the employer is doing them a   by inviting them to interview.  Believe in your self-worth!  They wouldn't have asked you to come in unless they thought you were promising, at least on paper.

In our case all the left over vacations from 2010, i have to use by April 2011. Also, for 2011 vacations if you are going on maternity leave, they cannot force you to take them instead of maternity leave. You are entitled to 16- 18 weeks of maternity leave in addition to the vacations for 2011. this is swiss law.   
Also, for the left over vacation for last year you can negotiate pay out for these days. Talk to HR. Also, very clearly try to understand the policy and cross check with the contract that you got.

3837	Employment	Where is the best job market for a marketing graduate in Switzerland?	kasia86	4155	10	Chicago	25.02.2011, 05:49	"    I am sure you would want to hear a more positive answer. But the truth is: Nowhere. There is no place in Switzerland that will give you much love for being an English speaker, especially not in marketing. As a marketer, you need to communicate a lot. So if you do anything on a Swiss market, you will need to speak the language. Or how do you plan to analyze a market if you cannot read publications written on it? How to you analyze the competition if you cannot read their website? The list is endless.   
But let's make this more fun. I am sure you know the following picture:       
Let's do it for the Swiss marketing-job market: 
- Rivalry among existing competitors: The market in Switzerland is saturated. While there are never enough Swiss IT developers or similar, there have always been enough Swiss who would like to work in marketing (while most of the ones I talked to actually didn't really know what marketing is...). 
- Threat of new entrants: Very high. Immigration into Switzerland is popular among well educated people, a lot of them recent graduates. The largest group of immigrants in Zurich are German, they have a competitive advantage over you. 
- Threat of substitutes: Very high. Many people with technical or other undergraduate degrees do some postgraduate education in marketing and will then compete with you... there have never been more people doing an MBA than right now, mainly because they got fired two years ago. They will compete with you in the coming year. 
Swiss companies I worked at actually preferred for lower level jobs a different type of substitute to a marketing graduate - as you said, you want to kick start your career. So you will not stay very long in your first job. Employers do generally prefer people staying in their job as long as possible, ideally never asking for a raise   So the much better alternative to you is to take somebody who did not go to a university but after his three year apprenticeship did a non-academic but therefore very hands-on local ""marketing planner"" course instead.   
And don't get me started on the bargaining power of employers... if they receive hundreds of applications, it is obviously relatively high.   
I do not want to discourage you, but realisticly speaking is the Swiss job market not exactly waiting for you. Therefore you should expect it to be not that easy to find a good job.   
You have probably seen this one as well:     
Which generic strategy would fit you? (Little hint: I for one try to avoid anything with ""cost leadership"" when it comes to people that should pay my salary...) You either need to differentiato yourself - for example with some very good references through internships - or you need to focus on something specific and your knowledge gives you and advantage....

I don't think you should worry you have smaller chances of getting a job in CH. From your post it is not quite clear to me whether you are interested in an academic career or in working in the private sector. If you want a job in the Swiss educational field, I would suggest that you browse the career sections of the Swiss Universities. There are plenty of opportunities, supposed you have a good track-record and some publications... Good luck!

There is a recession out there and Switzerland is not immune to the fallout. What OPs are saying is that for the time being, it's hard to get work permits, and many people here on short term work visas have seen these not being renewed. Visa for spouses are hard to get, and even if one has a visa landing a job is not easy.

I work as an asset analyst within an asset management team of an international company based in Stockholm. I know that my company does have an office in Switzerland so that makes one but what other ones are there. I'am also interested in Funds as I am doing my CFA. I could also consider asset management in general but I might have to start lower down in the food chain I guess. for what it matters I have an Msc in Economics and five years work experience. I'am open to different location but Zurich would be the likely candidate I guess.   
thanks   
Perhaps I should be clearer: I'am just fishing for asset managers or fund managers within the real estate sector, a market survey of sort.

I sympathise with your attempts to get useful information. It seems you're being accused of some nasty leeching, an accusation which you have defended well. Just to put it in perspective, some of the old timers here are fed up with people coming to ask the same old questions that everyone has, and there's been quite some talk about these newbies. So you've kind of stepped in at a bad time.   
As for your cost of living query, I'd suggest having a good look at some property websites for the apartment, so you know what your budget is. Also, if you can, it's always a good idea to come and visit the place to see for yourself. I did this and got a much better idea of the cost of living.

			You're right when you say it would be difficult because there is no standardised health care system: everyone in CH is duty-bound to have some kind of affiliation to private health care [AFAIK] otherwise you are in contravention of the rules. These are individually run and the monthly premiums are sometimes horrendously expensive. Obviously they need qualified employees but without fluent German or French, it would be almost impossible. Take a little look under Comparis health schemes which should give you an idea.

if you are married to a swiss and have a valid work permit already, it wouldn't hurt to just put that somewhere in the cover letter or cv.

			Being a shareholder does not give you any work permit. Why should it?   
You only can apply for a work permit for a specific job if you are a non-EU national. You will only get your permit if the employer can explain why there is no local or EU candidate able to do the job - and he has to show how he tried to find a local or EU candidate. ""Because we pay too badly"" is for example not a valid reason. Every time you change your job before you become a permanent resident (aka C permit) after some years will have the same high barriers. That's why it is not easy for non-EU people to not only find a suitable job, but also an employer who is willing to do the necessary paper work.   
You are obviously trying to find a way around this - but honestly: There is no easy back door to sneak in. All information is already discussed in excess on this forum - try to search for it before asking more...

			Hello Forum, 
 after some extensive googling around the web and sending some CVs, I think it is time to ask for some advice to other people. 
So the issue is that my wife is an educationalist (with a degree in education sciences, plus a post high school 3 years specialized school for educationalists and ten years of experience working with heavily handicapped people), she moved here together with out 2yrs old son and guess what, she would like to find a part time job possibly in her own field. 
She has also a B level german proficiency exam passed (Goethe Institut). 
We tried sending her CV to a few ""Stiftung"" (for example the big one in Uster, Wagerenhof), but some of the replies were about her specializations not being needed... 
We are a bit baffled. So what kind of job she might get? Do some of you have any pointers, references? We could not find anything on websites like monster.ch, etc. but we had to try every Stiftung website we could find individually.   
Thanks for any info, 
 Riccardo

Note that ""age discrimination"" does not fall under the Gender Equality Act.    
Also, you say that you travel a lot in your job. If that is the case, your boss might have founded reasons not to employ someone with small kids. Since you are less flexible to travel.

			OP needs job now. She has got basic German already, so not really lying.  
But I think I wrote enough in my previous post.     Idealism is very nice, but it does not pay bills, does it? And here we all pay bills every month. And to pay bills one has to do all the tricks just to get a foot inside 
...and then get fluency and later better job.   
I also had German speaking partner. But if you do not exercise your professional job with him day to day you have no chance to get your language skills. Unless, of course, it is household-like business. And even then - not sure.

He may be have to wait 1-3 months before beginning to collect and he must be looking for a job. They may also help him to set himself up as an independent consultant and/or give him classes on starting a company.      Sorry, this is not correct.    
ETA: I should read the whole thread before answering!    
As was said above and with the support of official websites, you WILL get unemployment benefit even if you quit your job. You MAY be penalized 1-3 months before you begin getting your payments. There are obligations placed on you when you are getting paid unemployment. Don't think you can run off on vacation during this time.    
As for the ""morality"" of collecting unemployment... The OP said his ""friend"" has worked in the same company for MANY YEARS, so I don't see him scamming the system. It's the ones that say ""Hey I've never lived in Switzerland before but I'm returning to Switzerland to collect social assistance. How much can I get?"" that get my mad.  THAT is abusing the system as they have never contributed ANYTHING to Switzerland.

			Hi Katarina, Summerrain is spot on. If you've never taught privately before then I would really research this, especially when it comes to teaching beginners. You have to have a really strong methodology as you are laying the foundations for these students, and it is too easy to not do this properly.    
Most recently I had a new student start who had already been learning for a year in America but could not name a single note, despite having worked through most of a book. It's too easy to always show a student what to do instead of giving them the strategies to be able to work it out for themselves.   
I use the gradings as a guide for students but don't think they are particularly necessary for becoming a good player/musician. Instead I have regular recitals for my students and make sure I incorporate theory and aural training into my lessons.    
Good luck with your teaching.

If you were highly qualified and Europe needed you, then after a lot of paperwork you could work here. But to expect to get a legal job, helping in a kitchen for instance, is not possible.

To answer your question, again: if your contract is only 15 hrs a week, you're fine, you'll get paid whatever the employer thinks is ok for that and make a regular contract with you.    
If you want to work full time, it will be as if you had no previous permit. All necessary steps to be taken by the employer will still be there, he will have to prove he did not find anyone better than you in Ch or EU17, submit papers, etc, then you'll get a new regular B or L permit and that is it. you do not have special privileges, maybe only that the possibility for rejection is probably smaller.

3916	Employment	Occupational Therapist seeking job [job suggestions!]	madpad	5018	1	Vaud	18.01.2011, 19:48	" 
			
			Hi,   
I am not an Occupational Therapist, but I am an outpatient at a psychiatric hospital in Vaud (Prangins), where I attend what I understand is the equivalent of occupational therapy twice a week.    
The therapists are called ergothéraputes (ergothérapie). They run 'ateliers' (workshops) which in- and outpatients attend, by appointment. There are a limited number of places per workshop. The focus is on learning and developing practical and creative skills (the three workshops are graphic - silk painting, encaustic wax, collage etc. - ceramic and the 'general' workshop, which includes wood work, metal work, work with plastic, fimo, jewellery making... it's very varied). Some patients only come while they are in hospital and it seems to be more of an occupational tasks. Others, like me, have found that they have learnt new skills and interests, and are encouraged to develop these, for example by preparing craft work to sell at the Christmas market, or by collecting paintings or other craft work for an exhibition.    
In addition to this, the therapists will work one-to-one with some patients, in consultation with their doctor. For example, mine works with me on organising my time and on developing my social skills.    
I don't know if that is the kind of role you were thinking of... I do know that there are ergothérapists working in many different areas.    
This is the official website:    
In terms of getting your qualifications recognised, I don't know for certain, but when I was trying to get my teaching qualification recognised here, I had to go through a very complicated process which took over a year (and was never successfully finalised).    
First I had to apply for equivalency of my qualification with the Swiss qualification. This involved filling out forms, submitting certified copies of all my certificates and writing a letter - all in French of course. It was also quite a costly business - several thousand francs. In my case, my employer paid.    
It took us several tries to find out who was the right authority to submit the application to, which complicated the process.    
Then I was told that I had been granted provisional equivalency, but that I had to fulfill two additional requirements. The first was to gain certification of my French competency. I was working as the English speaking teacher in a bilingual pre-school, but I was told that despite the fact that my work would be in English I had to gain a B2 level of French. If I had wanted to work with French speakers, it would have been C2 (the highest level). Second, I was told I would have to take a course and an examination in how the Swiss system worked - in French. I never got to this stage because I fell ill. The school that would have administered this is the same school that trains ergothéraputes, so I imagine a similar condition would apply to you.    
On the positive side, I often see jobs advertised, so there might well be work for you!   
Hope that helps.

			No, your hooliday pay is incluided in the 2 month notice period you have been paid for. If you had to work during these 2 months, then legally they would need to pay your holidays .   
There is no legal requiremetn to issue a standard contract based on code d'obligation, If you are both willing to sign the contract you can have any amount of bonus, notice period, holidays, clauses as you both wish, the ONLY legal requirement are for pension and obligatory social payments and that you both sign of your own free will.    
The contract is reciprocal, works both ways, so 1 day notice for you is the same for the employer....

			Hey again folks .. thanks for your views - really didn't expect much - and did really get some interesting insights from your folks      Thanks today .. I am a staunt believer of law of the large numbers   ... and the probability of me falling in the higher percentile on the  common sense scales almost surely converges with a probability of 1 .. so maybe with a bit of luck ... in a couple of years will do the mid way mark atleast  .      @Today Okay I did say I had 18 months of experience BETWEEN my internships(3) and work ex (work ex being 6 months) - and only the last 6 months in Europe - hence the apprehension and uncertainty. I am quite aware of what I would have had on my plate by now OUTSIDE Europe <read where I have worked and studied before>. Let me elaborate more the reason for my ignorance on the subject - I curretly work in Ticino in a small firm -  agree that I haven't networked at all as much as I would have liked - being the only person with the skills set in the firm - hence my professional network being more on the sales side - even though that is *NOT* my role per se. Even within the firm I've tried to get some estimates from colleagues - unfortunately don't get any satisfactory response because of lack of exposure on their part. Again professional networking is hampered by my lack knowledge in Italian just barely manage to understand for now - no offense to anyone  but I find people are much much more open and conversant in English in the swiss german part than here . <If I come out as sounding bitter - I apologise .. for I am not - AT ALL  - just stating  facts>. Ticino is an absolutely lovely place to live - but in professional exposure terms I think its dragging me behind thanks to the lack of networking opportunities etc etc. Hence my inkling to fiddle with the idea of moving to Zurich.      @Axman Thats something I didn't know @masters degree. Just out of curiousity - would you have a similar opinion about a 5Y combined {bachelors + master }in Mathematics + fin engg + statistics - just to understand how the swiss market prices my education. <I hope against hope after your statement, it isn't considered in the same league as Master of Finance  >. As for hiring phd's as Quants - it (being a quant) was an option to me - but since I already did some research much ahead of my peers in quant fin - I took the decision to try out the job scene to see how I really feel about it first  - to decide between a  quants kinda role Vs structuring etc  etc ... if I in the near future go for on the quants side <in that case I just work on my programming> - I do believe that I have the skills of a quant or atleast will have in a year or two Without a PHD and hope the job market does consider candidates with relevant skills rather than just degrees. On the other hand I was and still am very open to a role as a structurer - and then I wouldn't have wanted to wasted 4-5 years studying ,if thats where I land up. I mean I am ambitious by nature on most days ... at the same time am risk averse - hence my decision. My current role by the way is sort of a soft quant <nothing hard core in programming - from the scratch pricing & modeling> - the difficult part + structuring - and being a small firm need to juggle my time between the two - hence looking for something more concrete in possibly structuring / pricing after a while <I expect my <self> learning curve here to loose its convexity in the near future>.         140K with a Phd and 4 years work ex ?! Even to me that sounds sort of low <by PHD standards> - are the markets actually  that bad <Cause I keep seeing 150 sterling + offers on Wilmott.com for Phd quants> ? Although I have no clue about the bonus - I didn't get any thanks to joining at an inconvenient time in the firms bonus cycle. Also I had mentioned CFA L1 in my initial post - I actually am doing the CQF <Certificate in Quantitative finance for those of you who don't> - didn't expect as many responses - leave alone anyone knowing about this certification - hence substitued it with CFA <btw wudn't do it if I can help it>  .    
On that note could I pester you/anyone else who'd be kind enough for a counter question <please let me know if its not appropriate if I ask it here or rather start a new thread> 
1>Do folks with Mathematics/related masters 1-3 years work ex get hired as quants in Ch ? 
2> What would be your opinion on the salary numbers <range> with my skills set and work ex for a structuring role ?        @Ratbert, thanks for opining  .. meant 3 local languagues for CH as a whole, brightens me a bit about it not being a problem  .      @Ratbert - I thought I was really well paid until I actually landed here - the expenses for a normal easy going lifestyle lol   !! - classic newbie mistake I guess for someone moving here.  Makes me think for your first line you quoted lol. Pulling numbers wouldn't be my priority 1 in the short-medium term actually - getting better exposure - and dealing with permit issues in case of job migratoin <am a non EU citizen> would be over and above that.    
On that note - I;d fire another question at you folks if you'd be so kind to oblige me yet again - how much do first year analysts <say in trading/structuring> in the big swiss banks can expect to bag - I've heard 6K(beginningg) and I've heard 10K(after 1 y) .. am I close ?   
@Country_mouse - I did expect much more than a little bit of sarcasm - doesnt hurt if it is with good intentions

			It is true that taxes on 160k are higher in Canada than on 160k in CH. However, I don't think that an income of 160$C is required in Toronto in order to live a life equivalent to that of someone with 160k CHF income in CH.    
I maintain my non-scientific and totally random personal opinion of 110-120k $C income = 160CHF income in CH, even after taxes are taken into account.    
Reinsurance is a great business (a friend works as an underwriter in industrial risk) as far as I can see and depending on your level in an organization (I assume that if you are currently on 160k CHF that you are not at the bottom of the company) , the 100k+ salary is not out of reach (of course, I could not be more generic about this than I already am given that I know next to nothing about you)   
As for places to live, one of the nicer areas in downtown (and of the more expensive) would be an area called Rosedale. You will have a huge mix of Bay Street (Canadian Wall Street) folks, consultants, and other successful professionals. A slightly cheaper area, yet still very happening and only 10 minutes by Subway is the area around the Yonge Street & Eglington Avenue intersection, as well as Yonge Street and Finch Avenue.

I made an internship in Zurich at a private company. I liked the work, the company and my colleagues. Gues what, they like me too... and offered me a permanent job. As i did this internship in the middle of my studies, I first went home, finished university and two years later they still wanted me to return... which is why I ended up in Switzerland. So take your internship as a chance: check out weather you like the place, both work as well as the country, make as many contacts as you can and convince people of your abilities.

But it depends also on the kind of job you're looking for and the branch in which you operate. If the companies you apply to are big or not too small I wouldn't translate it. If you really want to translate it, then do it yourself. Just translate it and state that it is your own translation for their convenience. They don't have to read it if they don't want. Of course you have to send both the original and your rough translation. The CV should be in the other language but the letters of recommendation I wouldn't translate.

At the lowest end of the spectrum, a ""value"" meal at McDonald's will set you back CHF13-.  Even at an average restaurant, you'll be lucky to see change from CHF50- per person, and if you're eating at a white-tablecloth kind of place, it's CHF100+ per person.   
Starters at CHF15, mains at CHF35-40, desserts at CHF15, and CHF50 for a bottle of wine are the norms.   
Added to the price is the legendary Swiss service (slow and indifferent) which just adds insult to injury.  So these days, I prefer to eat at home (or cross the border into France or Germany, where I get much better value for money)

			I couldn't quite convey my whole question in the subject line (I guess there is a character limit).   
Quite frequently, somebody will post, ""I've been offered salary X.  I currently make salary Y, in {country}.""  Most of the time, those two statements are followed by some question like, ""is it enough"" or ""is it equivalent"", but really, they're asking, ""should I move to Switzerland"".     
I can understand that if you're considering possibly moving to a country you know hardly anything about, you want to gather information.  But has anybody actually used the information from the generic ""I was offered [salary]"" question actually used that information to come here or stay where they are?   
No matter what salary is posted, the replies are 50:50 ""you're better off staying at home, you couldn't get eat one Big Mac a week with that salary"" to ""oh definitely come 'it's a great experience' you won't regret it"".  Although I think we did decide that  .     
I mean, when somebody posts that question, they're either leaning towards coming and want to be talked into it, or they don't really want to come and are looking for excuses not to come.  Does anybody post that question without really knowing what they're going to do?  And why would anybody actually use information off of the EF to make a life decision?  I couldn't imagine hearing anything that would change my mind if I were to ask that question.     
So- my question is for all of the people who posted ""is [salary] enough"".  Did the replies on the EF actually change your mind?

if you live in Basel your taxes will be a bit higher if you live outside Basel (basel land) and you also have many daycare ..  
note that in Switzerland Women are payed less then man (! !) 
if you doubt about your salary you can try        
just to see if you are more less in the spec.

your deductions should be close to 1000 per month (depending on their pension policy it could vary -300). am in a hurry but am happy to help with a more detailed figure if you get back in touch. By the way 5k is close to the average, in ZH it's about 6k per month but that includes all those tosser bankers!!

I am a contract worker here, working as external staff, and employed with a non-Swiss organisation. My company pays me a monthly salary after the appropriate Swiss deductions. 
My query is regarding the deductions that go towards the pension fund. As I understand, the money accumulated in the pension fund over the years, is received by Swiss residents after they have retired. But what happens in case of expats who leave Switzerland after a couple of years stay?

			By the way, if employer by his own mistake paid out too much, he would have to correct it immediatelly or with the next salary payment. If he did not do that, employee can keep the money legally.   We had something similar at our company. Pay-roller guy of course did not tell this to the employee, only politely tried to pursue with all the calculations and explain, that mistake happened and it would be only fare to give it back. Of course the amount (pretty small, something like 1/15th of the salary) was stretched over months to be deducted to the level employee would not even notice it.

Tell your boss that such incidents are to cease with immediate effect.   
If there is no improvement, then take it to HR.   
Ultimately, be prepared to find another job and move on.

Why not find work in the area you're prepared for? Pair up with an advertising agency and write the music for TV shorts.

Pair up with a band or singer and write their music.   
Write your own music, record it, and sell it.   
Give harmony, counterpoint, or music composition private lessons for those 60 year olds who always dreamed of writing a symphony.   
Hey, better yet, you're not 60 yet, why not write your own symphony?   
To waste your time working in retail, as a baby sitter, waitress, or shop sales girl after studying something for which most people don't even have the talent for seems like a huge waste of a life and effort.

You can try to get in touch with the big festival organizations - go and talk with the Montreux Casino, try the Olympic committee, Paléo at Nyon... all these have year-round people working at the organization. You will need to do the leg-work, as they are interesting jobs they usually don't even advertise...

Mind you, when try to recruit my replacement back in 2002, I eventually had to go outside the EU before I found someone good. And that was a decent job.   
There is reluctance on the part of employers to up the rates. They're still lower (for contracts) than in the late 90s.

And it can't be the permit issue as well, I'm from EU and since I had applied for my permit there were no problems do get it done

			Marketing is also ""the thing"" at the moment, there are various higher education schools / courses for it in and around Zurich. I was checking for internships last year and even for that, the competition was out of this world fierce. One internship I was interested in had a hundred applicants within a week and the pay was miserable. The situation with proper jobs is not dissimilar. So I would definitely not move here before you have a job, you might find it will take a while until you find something.

			Well...   
To sum it up, we can go f*** ourselves.   
The clause in the contract is valid. Protection against moonlighting as per the lawyer.   
The fact that she can only work when she has a valid work permit but the employer didnt care to help her with that makes the whole contract a worthless piece of crap.   
To me it is like a paradoxon - we give you a job but you need a permit. We cant help you with the permit, but you cant apply for it yourself.   
The only thing that we can sue him for through a normal Antrag in the labour court is the money he owes me.   
The fact that you shut down your life, job and appartement / house in another country and move here because you have a ""work contract"" doesnt play any role in this country. Cant rely on this paper in certain cases...   
On a side note, I asked the lawyer what do I get if I break his nose - only a Geldstrafe. In case it would be my first time, I shall only get a Belehrung (Indoctrination?).

			AFAIK if you are a young male Swiss, you would be eligible for military service if you are in the country for a while, but 3 months? possibly this would be too short. I worked a long time ago for an Auslandschweizer who had spent his whole life in the UK. As soon as he returned to live in CH at the tender age of 42, the authorities called him up and he had to do some form of military service, albeit not as strenuous as the Rekruteschule.

			Ok, you have an 8 months old; and you are planning a second one. So in fact, you are looking at a minimum of 2 years at home... most likely 3. Aknowledging that will help planning! noting that you will need some kind of daycare if you are to study seriously is also a point.   
The first step is a good language(s) skill. To study, you need a good German, also because teachers will grade you in respect of that.    
After that, I guess the most reasonable would be to follow a similar type of studies as you previously did; import export is important here as well, and many international companies are settling here for their operations. It may be a good idea to go and see a serious headhunter/recruiter, and ask for an inspiration.

			As per the  :   
The notice period is usually set out in the employment contract, in the standard employment contract of the sector in question or in the collective labour agreement. In the absence of a contract or regulation, the following provisions from the Swiss Code of Obligations apply: 
trial period: seven days 
first year of service: one month 
second to ninth year of service: two months 
tenth year of service and beyond: three months. 
With the exception of the trial period, employment contracts may only be terminated at the end of a month and the letter of notice must reach the addressee before the beginning of the period of notice.   
So, upon termination of a contract, usually you have between one to three paid months. During that time, one usually continue to work, unless there is a special agreement.    
SOme large companies, in special situations, agree to pay additional bonuses such as a month of salary per year of seniority... that is not the norm though.   
There is no need for a special reason, but there is employement protection in case of illness, pregnancy, military service... and you can't be fired for reason of race, religion or politics (hard to proof though).

			Hi Harold, 
welcome to the forum - I know how hard it is to compare income between countries - had the same problems a few months ago (only in CH since September). I cannot comment on income comparisons between US and CH but there is a real good salary calculator available based on statistical data collected by the Federal Statistical Institute in Switzerland ( ). It's only available in German, French or Italian not English I am afraid, but it asks very detailed questions and provides you with the mean average and top/bottom 25% salary.   
Hope this helps..and ignore the rants, there are lots of helpful people on this forum and a few who like to point out to everyone to use the search function. Personally I don't understand that concept to use search for everything, this is a forum, it lives from questions and new threads - the alternative would be to lock down the whole thing and just google everything - where's the fun in that? Also salary information is changing all the time with prices going up and down, exchange rates changing....

I sent differing levels of information (degree certificate, references etc) for various jobs I applied to depending on how I was applying - ie through a website portal or email etc. I am a more is less type of person but everyone is different and I think everyone has had different success stories here in Switzerland (I think its highly dependent on whether the company is international for example etc).

			Does anyone know if you can choose which canton to register in if you have clients spread over the country.  I am wondering if a self employed person can register in the Canton with the lowest tax rate, assuming they have a client there?   
Or does it have to be the canton where you are domiciled?  Also, would anyone know the situation for frontaliers that have tax domicile in the EU?   
Cheers for any help :0)

I doubt that they apply the same restrictions to people reregistering after the termination of a temporary contract as they would to new applicants. However, I think you'd better contact them before your contract terminates, for there's a certain waiting period and you'll be without help for some time.

			I've found out something amazing and I'm really surprised nobody has mentioned this. I've just been to ORP Geneva, and I really like the system so far. But it's astonishing that with all the information out there I didn't know about them!   
During the weekend I was talking to a (Hungarian) friend about the difficulty of finding a job and how I'd need some really expensive further training, and so on and so forth. And she told me that when she moved to CH (at the time married to a Swiss), she was on ORP funded trainings for more than a year. And maybe I should check them out. Well, why had no one tell me about this earlier?   
I went to see them this morning, had an orientation session in the afternoon (a 90 minute long presentation of the system and the general options), and I'm going back next week for a personal appointment when I'll get registered. Note that I'm not doing it for the money, though it's good to know that I'm eligible to the 70% of my Hungarian salary. Which will be a small pocket money here   but still it's something and it feels good to be taken care of this way.    
Anyway, I'm really looking forward to the whole experience. I've never been officially unemployed, and as the money doesn't count so much (I'm not starving or anything and what I really want is a nice permanent job), I'm not even worried about their rules.   
I'll look around on EF and if there's a niche for this I might actually write a longer post on all the info I got. It was really worth it and I really think you should check ORP out if you haven't already. Because even if you think you're not eligible to anything, you might be in fact.   
Have a nice week.   "		 Jun 0001		[]	[]

			I had a colleague convert a UK PhD in Psychology and this is what I remember of the process:   
There were two avenues that this person persued:   
1. Insurance. 
2. Registration for health insurance rebate.   
1. To get professional insurance, you need to convince the insurance company that you are qualified. Usually to do this the quickest way is to get acceptance to the psych society. You will need at minimum a 4 year training in Psych to practice as a 'clinical' psychologist.    
Psychotherapy is not the same profession.   
You can apply to CRUS (council of universities) for a document which states whether your qualifications are recognised, and for what profession. This is not a difficult process but it helps if you have someone who understands the process and can write you a covering letter in German which describes your qualifications and what you are hoping to do with them...   
2. Health insurance rebates - the law changed recently and to get health insurance coverage a psychologist has to be practicing under the supervision of a psychiatrist, so if you practice independently you won't get health insurance rebates and this will limit your clientele to people who can pay privately...   
There is also a regulation regarding what you can call yourself in German. I can't remember what it was, I think it may have been that you can call yourself a 'clinical psychologist' but you can't call yourself a 'therapist'....unless you are fully recognised and working in the swiss health system...or something along those lines...

			It's not illegal in CH to discriminate in this way, and in fact the standard Swiss CV includes birth date. There are very few employee protections in CH.   
At my company, from age 45, employees are entitled to six months notice in the event of termination of employment by the employer. Prior to that, it's three months. This probably doesn't apply to all workers in Switzerland, but I think the principle of longer notice period for over-45s does apply. Another reason why employers think long and hard before taking on older employees.

			Well actually it is quite as simple:    
If you are a lawyer who is a EU/EFTA national and is admitted to practice in EU/EFTA you can register in Switzerland as a foreign lawyer but you have to practice under your original title (i.e. solicitor, barrister, etc.). All you need is a certification from your home bar (or other regulatory authority) confirming you are entitled to practice in your home country.    
If you actually want to practice under the German, French, Italian language equivalent (Rechtsanwalt, Fürsprecher, Advokant, avocat, etc.) then you have to have been practicing in Switzerland for at least three years as a ""registered foreign attorney"" (see above) and show that you have been regularly practicing Swiss law and have a short ""chat"" about their professional experience, or you can do an equivalency test.   
Registration is only need if you want to appear before courts. So if you are going inhouse, it does not matter. In any event have a look at  .

			You might be ""overqualified"" only compared to your regular CH applicant. I wouldn't buy 100% everything that guy told you.   
I would apply to international companies, they seem to value qualification they way you present it, and to CH companies as well, they must be used to seeing foreign applicant by now with a fat CV, anyways. It's been a while since CH opened the door for foreign competition on its job  market. Working for a local company is great, makes you blend in, get a new outlook on things here. But there are no real secrets about hiring jobs, apart from the fact it is about 100% harder here than elsewhere. Newcomers are disadvantaged in local positions, without the language skills, education tailored to suit local job market and without knowing how the network works here.    
It takes long to lay a good job, don't look for any mysteries in it, I would have all things translated, nice cover letter in both languages, and keep posting away. To reinvent yourself might be necessary, in a way that you basically need to relearn everything you know and apply it for conditions here, so you could compete with local applicants (plus their many languages), so I would keep posting for jobs, while looking into a course to get the language, the differences, etc. Some careers don't cross the borders, locals are protecting their market, but you can multitask while you are studying/working for free/intershipping to get to know how your career can fit in here. That always looks good on your CV, plus without languages here one might have the same chance of getting a job as an assistant as one would as a PR person. Once you have made yourself at least as good as your local competitor for a job position, you will be far ahead, with your experiences, degrees and time you spent working abroad. Then you will mack.

I'd lie if I told you that there are fat cheques at the end of each months. How much depends on the profile of the job: well known offices will get easily free workers (young architects want to learn, and value experience...), but smaller practices will pay some. I think you can aim at getting about 1500.- a month - not exactly riches, but as a Praktikant it makes sense.

			You could possible look at setting up a business which handles outsources admin for instance. When i started up this would have been quite useful to handle all the paperwork with the authorities etc, i assume you speak your local language fluently.   
Possible you could do something for invoicing, running accounting etc but without German or French it will not be easy at all. Big companies don't need or want to outsource their admin, small companies need local language skills to deal with the hum drum of daily corporate life.

I did not have a notice letter, so they adviced me to send a registered letter, that I considered today my day of notice, and accepted the notice, and I got 1 months salary from that date.   
I *think*, that a notice by email is considered legal, if you choose to accept it, print it out yourself and show  RAV, but if you say, you never received it, they must prove you did, and unless you clicked ""I confirm i read this mail"", they will only have evidence, it was delivered to the mailserver. not 100% sure though

			Hallo all.  
I just had some questions about what certificates are required to be able to teach english as a foreign language here in lovely Zurich. 
The internet is overwhelming, thought maybe I'd cut corners and ask someone here. 
Little background about me...from Canada, came here to be married in Dec. I have NO college degrees. I graduated highschool and got lucky with a job at a great company and worked there for 7 yrs. Now, I am here and finding a job is not going to be easy as everyone wants degrees. I started thinking what about english and teaching it? 
I am just not sure of exactly what certificates most people want to see (TESOL, TEFL, CERTA??) I am new at all this and a little confused about where to look and what schools are reputable for getting these from.   
any help/advice is appreciated.  
(I also don't know german, although I am in the process of enrolling somewhere to start that as well)   
I also have much work to do on my CV (don't even know where to start with this b/c of my lack of degrees and whatnot)   
Thanks again guys!

A 13th salary just means your annual salary is divided by 13 rather than 12.  Providing your employer does not go bankrupt before the end of the year you get it easily. It ios basicaly a savings scheme run by your employer and at the end of the year you get 1/13th extra which is made up of 1/13th for January, 1/13th for February, 1/13th for March and so on.    
If you are not so disciplined it maybe good for you as you then have enough $$ for Xmas or to pay your taxes, however it is your emplyoer who collects the interest on the accumulated monies not you.   
You wiould be financialy better off, alébeit it very small, to take your salary over 12 months and each month save 1/12th at the end of the year this makes up your 13th saalry and you have a little interest earned at the bank !   
You could also have 52 salaries, meaning a weekly salary if your employer agreed to this.

			what sky said, with one exception: The agencies with mandates I was in touch with before would be paid for their work - so they work very differently from headhunters that simply want to close a deal. So they do not ""bend"" you that much as they do not see you as a product - they mainly deliver a service and bill it by the hours spent on it. I was once in the process and after five meetings, the company decided to cancel the head count and simply not hire anybody anymore - a headhunter would have gone berserk, but the lady I worked with was completely ok with that.    
They make some funny personality tests and more interviews than a companies HR would do with you (since they get paid for the time they work on assessing you...). The ones I met were all far more professional than any other species of consultants in the ""career"" market, so I decided to only apply to companies directly or work with them - none of the others...

I am definitely pursuing my path as a history teacher. I could continue my studies or work at a local school, either way I would first have to learn German. My top priority is to learn German, just wish I could get a fairly stable job while learning this difficult language. Sie, sie, Sie, and sie!! Nominative, Dative, Accusative, Genetive!!!!

4193	Employment	officially employing a cleaner, what to do?	guest	4030	11	null	1.1.0001, 00:00	" 
			
			We just did all the paperwork ourselves to employ our cleaner so I thought I will post here on what steps we took. It's also still a learning process for us so if anyone thinks I did something wrong, please feel free to correct me.    
First, you have to register for the ""Simplified Accounting Method"" with the AHV. (I do not want to imagine what the non-simplified method entails) 
You can read it here (in German)      
You only qualify for the simplified method if your cleaner is not getting  
more than CHF 20000 per year from you. Fill out this form and mail it back to them. We live in Aargau but  has all the office addresses of all Kantons. Just mail it back to your cantonal office.        
We received an information package from our local office about 1 week after sending in our registration form. The AHV sent us a letter confirming that our cleaner is now covered under AHV and we were to forward that letter to our cleaner.    
As for accident insurance, you have to arrange for it yourself - CHF 100 per year.    
We used this  to calculate our yearly payment and I imagine we send this spreadsheet back to the AHV at the end of the year. AHV will send you some kind of bill at the end of every calendar year. The part in the spreadsheet that says ""Familienausgleichskasse"" varies from canton to canton. In Aargau, it's 1.4% and in Zurich, it's 1.5%.    
The amount that you will be paying your cleaner each month will actually be less than the full salary. Based on  , your cleaner's weekly salary is CHF 100, but you only pay her CHF 88.95 a week after all deductions, i.e. CHF 11 .05 of her weekly salary is withheld and goes toward her AHV contribution, which you, as the employer pays on her behalf at the end of the year. Multiply that for a full year, the employer pays CHF 497.95 to AHV and also the CHF 574.60 withheld from the employee for the past year.    
Hope this helps because in the other thread, there was a link to TopCombi and I tried using that service but it's only applicable for the canton Bern. We had to learn the hard way to do all these ourselves.

			For permanent work it is irrelevant.   
If the agency has a job advertised with a salary of 100k, then that is what you will get. The agency will then charge the client X% of the salary. You personally won't be any better or worse off.   
For contract work however, the client pays X out to the agency. The agency skim off their margin and give you the rest, the more they take, the less you get.    
Perhaps you could argue that 15% is an acceptable figure for an initial contract (advertising, CV filtering and so on), but certainly not for a renewal. The agency has hardly had to do any extra work now, have they?

			Hi, 
Firstly - I am employed, but am only trying to help a couple of friends out. They are a couple (French and German - Both English speaking) who have moved back from Australia, and want to explore job opportunities in Switzerland.   
The thing is: I know nothing about their industries and am finding myself almost useless to try to help.   
The insustries they work in are: 
Medical Implant devices (formerly Global Project management for Cochlea), and his girlfriend is a Market Research Analyst (Branding and Trading).   
I have contacted a couple of companies that I have the odd tie to for help (still waiting - and am not holding my breath), and have searched both the EF threads and google for appropriate websites to search on.   
The best generic search engines I found were these three:   http://www.jobs.ch/en/
http://www.jobsinzurich.com/ http://www.careerjet.ch/english-speaking-jobs.html  
So what I am asking is that if you are in, or know of someone in these industries, could you help direct me to the most appropriate websites (either recommended job search engines, or to the home pages of potential companies). 
I am obviously conducting my own (with limited knowlege) searches, as are they, but anything else anyone can offer is greatly appreciated.

			An expat is hired because of a specific background and experience, and that has a price; but that doesn't mean that with equal qualification a Swiss would not be paid the same. In addition, there are usually (if s/he moves within his company) compensations for accepting a relocation - hardship (although CH hardly qualify), school fees, housing and home leave allowances, etc. All this raise the whole compensation package.    
Beyond these categories and reasons, salary scales are not different in large companies just because of the citizenship.

			Dear forum member,   
I am an academic researcher in finance, specializing in questions related to banking regulation and macro-finance. Indeed, concerning banking regulation, I am working on solutions to the to-big-to-fail bank problem, especially in the context of the current debate in Switzerland. With regard to macro-finance, I deal with the link between asset price volatility and the real economy. My geographic focuses are Switzerland and Asia.   
I would very much appreciate if anyone could suggest me possible (if any?) job opportunities in industry for such research topics. Otherwise, would you have an idea about which research topics in finance give a better chance to work in industry?   
Many thanks in advance.

As we do not have any specific course related to Luxury (brand management, ect) I am trying to find some other options.

Any advice is welcomed

1. HEC Paris 
Luxury strategies (certificate) 
Seems to be te best option   
2. ESSEC   
3. there are some really short-term courses (1-7) days in London 
St Martin's, but I really doubt whether they can be of any help    
I will study in Lausanne. 
Actually I am not even sure that my schedule will allow me to make a break for courses in another country

I am currently studying sports therapy in the UK.   
I would like to move back to Switzerland when I graduate (I worked in Zermatt as a ski instructor before and my partner is Swiss) and get involved in rehabilitation of injured skiers etc.   
However I am having problems finding out if Sports Therapy is recognised in CH. Here in the UK you can work privately or for a sports team with a sports therapy qualification but not for the NHS.   
Anyone have any idea of where I can find out? I can do a masters in physio once I graduate, but this is 2 years and £10,000 I'd rather not spend if avoidable!

Yes it takes years to get these kinds of skills to be able to leverage in IT, so my comments were not specifically for the OP. Moreso that Switzerland is quite bouyant for higher skilled staff in IT. One of the reasons is due to the difficulty companies have been having getting non-EU permits, so if you have the right skills and are in country with appropriate work permits then there is no reason not to be able to find work right now. Just my experience with things, others experiences may of course be completely different.   
The US and UK is very hard right now as is most of the EU.   
Australia is going all guns blazing but again difficult to be permitted to work unless you have some specific roads into the market.

			Hello,   
I'm new here. I found this site while Googling an unrelated question, and have since joined.    
Currently I'm a postdoc in Freiburg, but am strongly predisposed toward seeking out a future career in industry, either as a medical writer or as a research scientist. Since my thread question concerns the former, I'll focus on that for the moment.    
I see there are a few medical writers on here. How did you enter into the profession? Is it very stimulating work? Would you continue this work indefinitely, or use it as a stepping stone to other positions like management? I understand it pays about the same if not better than a postdoc, but since I would be living in Germany and potentiality working in Switzerland I really don't know how much this would yield financially for me. An EWMA survey I read stated 70-100k euro for German companies depending on years experience - is that similar in Switzerland? How are the working hours; i.e.,  is this a suitable job for those wanting to spend time with their loved ones? I guess I'm currently pulling 50 hr weeks and am finding this to be a good balance between work and family life.    
Sorry for all the questions! Cheers, DrC   "	1	 Aug 2010	0	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

			What I'm confused about is why do you want to keep your B permit if you don't want to live in Switzerland?  If you get rid of your apartment in Switzerland, you will have to get an apartment in the UK (or where ever you establish your residency).    
The company is paying your lodgings because you are not in your home country. They will pay your hotel when they  . They will not pay you if you are at home. IE, they won't pay you to stay in London if you establish residency there.    
If you want to establish your residency somewhere else, UK, Barcelona, whatever, you need to  about how to do that & then get a place to live there or I imagine if it's in Barcelona you could list your parents as your home. In which case you give up your B permit.

			Dear all,   
We just moved to Zurich from Lausanne last week. I am new to this forum and am looking forward to make many friends here. For the moment I have some query regarding eligibility of maternity leave.   
I am a PhD student at EPFL in Lausanne. My contract finishes on the 31st of August 2010. I am 21 weeks pregnant. So when the contract finishes I will be 26 weeks pregnant. Baby is due for December 1st week. Does anybody know about the eligibility of maternity leave in such a case? The HR department was not very helpful. They just told me its an insurance company which deals with it and they were not sure of it.    
I will be registering with the Arbeitlosenkasse next month. Before that I wanted to educate myself with other options. Any info will be of help.   
Thanks 
Anu

			Thanks once again for the feedback and points duly noted.   
Based on my previous experience, where I did the same thing taking on additional responsibilities and then there was a vacancy at senior level which I was an ideal candidate for, as I had been performing some of its tasks on ""ad hoc"" basis. During the initial meetings regarding my suitability for the role and the renumeration offered, I was told that I can only get 10% payrise max. Though the job was advertised externally at about 80% more than my salary level! Whereas I could have been happy with say about 50% increase. I did not get it, as I was not willing to do it at mere 10% increase and it left a bad taste in my mouth. Things changed and I moved on, not denying the skills I learned there helped me a great deal with the next job!   
I am facing the same situation again. The additional tasks I am being ""asked"" to perform, they will need another full time employee to do that about on same payscale as me. I would say I can do it for, reasonably speaking, about 20% - 40% increment, depending on what the new role would entail.   
Worst case scenario would be I do the additional tasks and enhance my skillset/profile and then perhaps look for better job elsewhere. It would not be a big deal in terms of time management, as I am confident I can perform all those tasks without having to stay late i.e. still fit within reguler 9-6 working hours.   
However, its a good company and I would prefer to stay here rather than move around as Im growing older.   
A lot of corporations tend to hang this carrot of ""development and prospects"" in front of you and make you do a lot more than what they are paying you for. My only conern is, this way I will always be underpaid in relation to my actual job tasks. Experience has taught me to get the appropriate salary before you take on anything extra, ""we can talk about it later"" never materialises.

			My view, (as i have seen them in various offices): 
I think yes, labor-specialization is very much sustainable.  
they are very much happy doing their routine work, they are very much adjusted to it, that is called work for them.... unlike private jobs where you will always have to keep changing/updating everyday...they need not worry about other topics, just stick to their area of work, do it and move out. tension less job. whenever there is something new introduced in their area, just get updated about it. that's how it is. 
this will continue for years ahead!!! 
it should sustain atleast until they do their job perfectly and efficiently (or atleast near to perfection)!! 
people will be happy if they have up-to-date updates of their work and do it efficiently without causing any hassles to the help seekers   "	10	 Dec 2009	1	['0', '0']	['4', '2']	0

			Somehow I can't imagine either of those cantons being stupid enough to offer an incentive to the unemployed to move there. I imagine that the reason they extended the benefits was because unemployment is so high in those cantons, so trying to attract even more unemployed would be shooting themselves in the foot so to speak.   
Before you move (if it for the purpose of maximizing your benefits) I would check that you don't actually have to have been resident in those cantons when you became unemployed in order to benefit.

			As of learning German, I would advise an intensive course, it is 5 day a week 4 hours a day. A ""semester"" lasts for four weeks and you need 8 weeks to complete a any of A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 level. Since you have nothing else to do in the moment, this would be pretty good option. I know Migros Klubschule is offering these classes, but I think there are more schools you can shop around. Any self or distance studies will not do.

If you are trying to quit your job, then your notice period should be in your contract. The letter must arrive by the last day of the month. 
Example if you have a three month notice period and you want to quit your job now, you would send in your resignation letter ""REGISTERED"" (very important) at least two to three days before the end of this month (July 31st). You would then have to work August, September and October, before you could leave (if you have vacation days, you might be able to negotiate to leave earlier).

			I agree with everyone who says 'go talk to the RAV'. You can certainly check the web-site ( ) for your closest office; but I'd go for a face-to-face and register with them ASAP.   
As long as you've paid 12 months+ tax, then you're entitled to unemployment insurance. But...it's more akin to the naming in the UK these days...i.e. 'Job Seekers Allowance'. They want to know you're seriously looking AND that you follow the rules they have in that regard.   
You'll need to prove a certain number of applications per month and they expect you to be looking during your notice period (which I'm sure you are). In terms of applications: telephone calls, email, face-to-face meetings, letters to companies not currently advertising AND networking with colleagues can ALL count. But it's best to consult the experts (RAV) and find out what they expect.   
Also, if you don't speak much German yet or even need to re-skill...you may find there have something to help. Like any insurance company, they're loathed to part with money long term...so anything they can do to help you back on your feet ASAP, I'm sure they'll at least consider it.   
In case you haven't guessed, I was actually made redundant at one point; so I've been thru' the mill.

Get a professional to check the certification (reference) her work gives her before she formally accepts it, there is a lot of double speak in them which only a HR profesional can deciper. I know of a few people have done this and asked for it to be reworded to accurately define what they did and how they performed.

			Hi,   
I am a student of hospitality field with working permit visa in France, I will have one month vacation this September and I will live with my bf in Bussigny this time. But my bf has to go to work in weekdays so I do not want to just staying at home and do nothing. Thus I would like to find a half-time job not only to kill my free time but also to earn some money for my coming term in France. I think baby-sitter or pets-sitter could be suitable for me, I can speak English and French, and I also can cook well.   
So if you hae some informations or advices for me, I really appreciate that. Thank you very much in advance.

			When I suffered from work related stress, my doctor signed me off for three weeks. I.e. I got a doctors note, and I got my contractual sick pay, just as if I'd caught some disease. Similarly for a friend of mine earlier this year. He got signed off for two weeks. Think about what would happen if you were hospitalised for six months, with six months convalesence. How would your employer behave then? Stress can be an illness.   
It would seem reasonable that if your employer is causing you to be ill, that they'd have some kind of liability there. Consult a legal expert.     , I would suggest that you should scale back to working only your contractual obligations. If your contract says 42 hours per week, and you reach that on Thursday at 3pm - go home. What's the worse that can happen? They fire you. Which is what you want.    
Whatver you do, don't quit without taking serious professional advice. While remembering that no job is worth your health.

			Unfortunately, a trial period is only half a solution.  Sure, it will confirm that you are a good, hardworking cleaner - but the real reason for references is to check that you are honest, not so much that you are competent.  If a new cleaner leaves streaks on the mirror or dust bunnies under the bed, I'm not too worried - we can talk about that and he can redo it if necessary - but a new cleaner who swipes my stuff and leaves town is a much more serious risk, and references are really the only way to address it.       They will be more likely to trust you because your mutual friend serves as an implicit character reference.  Once a few of these are satisfied customers, beg for permission to use them as references.  If they say yes, reward them in some way (e.g. a discount, a voucher for free services) and try not to abuse their generosity.  Realize that they are agreeing to let complete strangers disturb their privacy for your benefit; for Swiss people especially, this is a really big deal.   
Whatever you do,    This raises suspicion because it is exactly what a thief who plans to show up once, steal what he can and leave town would offer.  Offer a discounted rate instead, say 20% discount for the first five hours.      - perhaps in their home, perhaps for a coffee somewhere.  Goes without saying that you should work any reassuring personal details into this conversation (are you married to a Swiss? are you married, full stop? have kids in school here? Anything that helps you seem more trustworthy, less likely to skip town.)   
Best of luck!

4314	Employment	How long between verbally informing of redundancy and confirmation in writing	Scoobysue	990	0	Basel	28.06.2010, 10:39	" 
			
			Hi,   
I've searched but not found the answer to this specific question. Although I've found out lots of other stuff - for example, that the term 'redundancy' is probably inappropriate.   But how long is an employer allowed to get ready to confirm in writing a conversation in which you've been made 'redundant' (for want of a better word).   
I was told in a meeting last Tuesday but have been fobbed off ever since that the letter 'isn't ready' yet.  Now I know it's not official till I have the letter but what's bugging me is that I was told contradictory things about the terms of my severance by different managers.  Only the letter will confirm what the deal actually is.   
Contractually, I'm entitled to a period of time when my salary will still be paid so that's all okay but this dance of the letter seems to me like some kind of psychological game-playing that one would not expect from a grown-up.

			Hi there, 
I'm a student about to attain a degree in business and economics in Stockholm, Sweden. Since I've lived in Switzerland before and really liked the place, I've decided that I want to return and have therefore applied for some jobs in Zurich.   
Now I've got interviews coming up at a couple of the big four audit firms and apart from more general interview topics (career motivation, cv talk, personality etc.), I'm not sure how to prepare in terms of more audit related technicalities.   
My major is in economics and my accounting knowledge is therefore very limited, but I've understood that the employers are pretty liberal in Switzerland in terms of educational background, at least in comparison with those in Sweden who require a degree in accounting and certain law courses.    
Has anyone here gone through the recruiting process at an audit firm on the entry level? Would be very grateful for some advice       
Thanks!

			Hi,   
if you have an unrestricted B-EU/EFTA permit, than you do not need to have any additional permission. All you need is a signed contract between you and your employer, which could be a private person. Employer must do a tax/social deductions. You can also go through a payroll company, but I believe they might not be interested since your income will be relatively low so you can not pay them good enough.

			Seriously..... qualifying will be easy, but you have to have no moral fabric whatsoever to persist in the industry.   
I'm sure if you asked at an agency they would provide you with the information you require (as far as qualifications go). There will at least be a governing industry body and website. 
The qualifications seem to focus on whatever the relevant 'property law' may be...... being able to lie through your teeth and walk without a spine is something they would consider a prerequisite.   
I wouldn't be too concerned about being able to qualify though..... agents never seem to be that kid at school who was ""Top of the Class"".   
I wont bang on about my experiences with these filthy maggots, but I will wish you the best of luck..... I have no idea what real estate agents are like here.

4327	Employment	How long will the notice period be?	doubao	1855	5	uk	19.06.2010, 00:44	"    you need to ask your company how long the open period is, because my company is 3 months, and if there are different variations in other companies, I would say Yes.    
As I said ""just take off"", I don't mean not telling the company and the boss. Unless you are working as ""black"". I was referring to ""not giving enough 3 months as open period, or doesn't approve his job-quitting application by the boss (it happens to someone I know, just because the boss doesn't want him/her to leave, doesn't mean he/she just can not leave the job, it's his/her freedom, not some condition to be threatened.)    
From my experience, to some companies, even you give 3 months open period as they required, you still has to pay a certain amount of money due to your signed contract. For example, your contract says you have to work at least 5 years, but you only have worked for 3 or 4 years, you need to pay money for breaking the contract. It's some companies' policy.    
And again, never sign any contract written in a language you don't fully understand ( although I bet it's commen sense), unless you have a thing for finding troubles for yourself, that's another story.

			A friend (EU) has performed some freelance translation work for her former (Swiss) employer. Now they want her write an invoice for the service provided.    
However, I believe it would be more advantageous for her to have the income taxed as part-time work (for the employer) at an hourly rate. (we don't know how self-employment is taxed and administered).    
She is also currently looking for work, and (I believe) it would be beneficial to make social security contributions in a given month, so I think she should ask the employer to pay her wages, and make all the necessary deductions.

			Hi all,   
I am presently staying here on dependent L-permit and my spouse works here.   
I had applied for vacancies in various companies in Switzerland and till date I have got no luck.  
One of the well-known company out here has replied as I quote here: 
""The local authorities have a very restrictive approach to applications for work and residence permits for new immigrants. In view of the existing legal situation, there is unfortunately no possibility that you will be granted a permit.""   
I have also spoken to the HR personnel of another very well known company who had requirements matching my skillset and who have explained me the exact same thing.    
In both the cases, I have come to know that since this skillset is quite niche here, so they are now getting resources from non-EU country through service providers.   
Now, my question is, since I could have also been eligible and since I am in Switzerland presently, should I not be given preference over folks they are getting from outside? 
Is it really true that there is no chance that I will be granted work-permit here?   
Any suggestions/advice is welcome.   
Many thanks.

Perhaps if you were even able to help them find someone to replace you that could help too??

4354	Employment	A question about legality	monimora	1086	3	Germany	06.06.2010, 23:45	"    1. Between 1993 and 1999 I was working in the UK while pursuing a PhD at the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium. I was a non-visa national, but in fact obtained in 1994 Unlimited Leave to Remain in the UK. It was theoretically possible (at that time) for me to have a student visa for Belgium but the Belgian Embassy for reasons best known to itself was causing difficulty, suggesting I return to the country which had issued the passport, but in which I hadn't lived for over 20 years. As a result the Dean of International Students rang the relevant government office and, as a practical solution, the head of the Office des Etrangers volunteered to put my file on the bottom of their in-tray and leave it there for a year. In subsequent years I was never in Belgium more than a few days at a time and no visa issue arose.   
2. That story predates Schengen and the UK is outside of Schengen anyway. But it does suggest that your case may be best be addressed by your university.   
3. I note that on a commercial visa service site it states: ""None of the embassies of the Schengen countries will issue a visa if there is already one active in your passport.""   (By comparison, there is no impediment to the issuance of a second, valid visa of a different type by a US consular office; this is a particular Schengen rule. And perhaps a single Schengen visa can permit different cross-border activities.) Presumably you need a visa for the country where you will reside, and (assuming that is Switzerland) employment authority in the other country. Bear in mind that ""employment"" occurs where the work is performed: if you are undertaking your research or management or investment, etc. obligations for the German country in Switzerland then Germany does not have principal responsibility either for your visa status or your income taxation. In that case, you would (it seems to me) apply for a work permit for Switzerland with the notation that you will also be studying for your PhD.    
By and large, student visas do not prevent portfolio investment, or membership of a partnership, in another country. The issue then is what ""work"" you are performing and whether that violates the terms of your Swiss student status. You may (indeed probably will) also become liable for Swiss taxes and will have to look to the social security totalisation agreement and the double taxation agreement for relief.    
4. Whatever your situation, it is so arcane that you are unlikely to get proper advice online. I think your first stop has to be the office that was most helpful to me when the Belgian consular officers caused me grief, i.e. the university foreign-student office. Your prospective employer, on the other hand, will be responsible for sponsoring your work permit, in whichever country that work is performed.   
(My case was even more arcane, however: I had been working as a diplomat in Geneva and nobody, least of all the Belgians, had considered the eventuality that a diplomat would become a student. I have since met other diplomats who undertook postgraduate studies while working as diplomats but I retired instead, thus ending my status.)

			Given the length of notice periods here I can think of many instances where a new employer may not necessarily want it to be public knowledge who a position has been offered to. There are several reasons why an announcement about who will be taking over a vacant position may be left until shortly before the new person take up the position. In such a case, and if the new employer is indeed NOT a direct competitor I would have no qualms in responding with ""I am sorry but I am not at liberty to say"" if asked where one was going to work. I would, however, also assure them that it is not a direct competitor.

			@higgybaby: thanks, yeah, i've registered with many agencies, and sending the cv everywhere possible. i even translated the cv from english to german (which i also speak at work) to increase the chances. yes, the idea of ending my employment has been mentioned very briefly with the management (as explained below). i don't want to do that, and things have calmed down a bit at work since our last meeting. but of course if things fire up again, then we can have easy talks. i don't want to go all close-minded and hand a resignation without talks/discussion.   
@Cashboy: that's what i've been doing, stick to my current job until i find a better one, so thanks for the advise (fits your username haha).   
don't know what industry/field you're in, but no one wants to be unemployed (don't know about others, at least i am) as it's a bad thing, especially in the IT industry.   
i don't know how you concluded the misunderstanding and assumption that i am considering being sacked to claim the benefit immediately.. 
"" ""   
i am guessing you read that in the first post... 
"" "" 
i underlined the ""of course"" bit above for a reason   point 2 below explains in more detail.   
don't know what kind of ideas you hear from other people around you or how you got led to that conclusion, but here's a clarification of my situation/intentions:   making the assumption that i want to take the easy way and just chill and get money for nothing is completely wrong. i should probably clarify the picture for you a bit more..   i don't know about businesses in the UK, but i noticed the problem here in CH some big companies are way too formal/diplomatic and have a lack of trust with employers (not just swiss companies, even foreign ones). again, that's my observation from my experiences.   
so, Cashboy, i hope the clarification above is good and clear enough, and let me know if you have any questions   best of luck.

Ok, I am in a predicament, I don't want to lose my job or anything, especially as my choices are a little limited but I started working in a bar/restaurant in December 2009 with a 3 month trial period, after this trial period was finished, I was supposed to earn a few hundred more on my monthly wages.   
Problem: Still getting the same monthly wages as during my trial period even though my contract clearly states that after the trial period, my wages will increase.   
2nd problem with a twist: My boss says that the 13th month wages (which is included in my monthly pay) makes up for the rest.   
This is clearly wrong surely? am I being cheated out of my 13th month wage?

I eventually (after several phone calls and trips to the CSR) ended up sitting outside my social worker's office this morning and staying there until she could see me! She told me not to register with the ORP or, in fact, do anything at all. Something to do with the fact that I am trying to become an independent proofreader. I didn't quite grasp why, but I'm not complaining. She has to check with her boss and will (hopefully) get back to me.    
So much for the very threatening tone of the ORP's website which did not help the anxiety at all this morning!

			Hi,   
it depends. will you be the responsible person for the job? or part of a team? you can have a look at michaelpage.ch, they have a salary survey there, with detailed numbers for guys doing conso.   
i would say you should ask more. around 120. but its hard wo the details.   
when i came here i went to a smaller kind of company(still it was stock quoted) to do conso, and external reporting under ifrs. There were no team, I did it all myself. i started with 100k, but managed to get 120k later(honestly i dont know...maybe i was overpaid??).then i was laid off .   
You can still say you are not aware of Swiss salaries, and would like to know what they offer.   
I guess it is a bank so you can also hope that somebody pops up to help you out as I have no clue whats the moneys in banks.

			Hi,   
When I came here I was working in a bilingual pre-school. Here is some information based on my experience of getting a qualification recognised.    
Your wife needs to get in contact with the OFFT (that's the French name). They deal with the recognition of childcare qualifications from other countries.   Be warned, although the site is in English they do not like it if you make your application in English, even if she has a job in an English setting. You have to use one of the native languages.    
The UK childcare certificate that the OFFT recognise is the BTEC Level 3 National Diploma in the Early Years. If your wife has / is going to have a different qualification she is going to need to prove that her qualification is equal to that qualification. This might be easy for her to do if she speaks to one of her tutors about this now.    
Even if your wife is employed as an English speaking member of staff in a bilingual setting, she may well be required to prove her proficiency in one of the local languages so that she can communicate with parents and other staff and the authorities. I was required to have a B2 level certificate.    
In addition to this, your wife will probably be required to take some courses on the Swiss social system as part of the recognition of her qualification. This will be in the local language. I was told I could either do a 6 day training course followed by an examination, or a 9 month period of practical work as a trainee in an appropriate setting supervised by a qualified practitioner, with some days of training. I am not sure if this would be paid or not - but I think it is.    
I have to add three things. First, in my case the authorities actually allowed me to start work while this process was in place, on the condition that I  fulfilled the above requirements in a set time. Second, to get to that point took 10 months so you need to start things moving. Third, due to health issues I ended up leaving my job before the process was completed so I don't have any experience of what happens when it's all done!   
I hope this helps    
Victoria

			No one can advise you, as all anyone cares about is how much money they will get.  Whether that's just salary, or salary plus a load of ""benefits"", as those benefits are all simply a (sometimex tax efficient) way of giving you things which have a monetary value.   
As economisto has said above - I just want the money.  In my bank.  No pissing around.  I don't want the company to use my salary to buy things for me on my behalf, unless it's something I would have bought anyway and they get a huge discount which they pass on.  Which has never happened to me.

			Consider vocational training schools. They are state (Kanton) run and are an important institution with around 70% of Swiss teenagers serving an apprenticeship. Salary depends on the Kanton. I can say that the Kanton of Zurich pays far better than private schools. 
However, teaching teenagers can turn out to be worse than your wildest dreams.

			Listen, the Op want's advice, that would be go where your language skills aren't holding you back, and you can get experience. Moaning about a lack of self worth from a voluntary situation, or the claim that the Swiss somehow don't value latins is both pointless and incorrect.    
The OP was capable enough to obtain qualifications in a tough discipline, but some how not worthy of some straight talk, some of you feel! But then who needs straight talk when the fluff brigade are here to say 'there there' isn't it a bad place, but actually offer nothing.... wise up and more importantly lighten up.   
Finally, I have lived and succeeded in countries where I don't speak the languagel, it's called adaptation, but I voluntarily wouldn't go somewhere I don't speak the language and then whine that I'm not understood or can't get a job, it's my problem to be responsible for.

			I have learned a bit more in the last few days.  For the benefit of anyone like me, I'll note it.   
A recruiter told me today that recruiting firms cannot (cannot easily, or simply cannot?) get visas for non-original-EU workers for IT.  She did say that the companies themselves can, and that I should try to go directly to them.   
What I had read in a few places, including (I thought) one of the Swiss government or embassy sites, was that while gaining permission for employment was very difficult, it was not so difficult for people in high demand areas such as IT and healthcare.  Even still, perhaps ""not so difficult"" still means ""very difficult""!   
Finding the companies can be a challenge depending on your Google search-fu, so a good starting place is a search like ""companies with headquarters in geneva"".   
The recruiter also noted that they get hundreds of CVs for every job post on the very first day of the post.  Sounds like the same situation we have here.  I didn't ask if she had a sense of the origin of the applicants, but I have a guess.

			Is this not just a case of market forces at work, businesses especially in todays climate are looking for value for money the same as any of us would as individuals.  From my perspective we are still better off living and working in Switzerland than we would be back in the UK, the economy has more stability, the level of wages and standard of living is generally higher so what are we losing.  I believe we should have the glass half full approach and think of the boom years as a bonus rather than suggesting now that we are hard done by. To be honest I would echo some of the previous comments, ethnic workers tend to be more satisfied with what they have and the fact they actually have a job,  whereas some of the Brits I talk to just expect more and more without actually giving anything extra in return.  For ethnic workers this also means that their future expectations are lower which to an employer is worth its weight in gold.  We also have to remember that 3 years ago when the exchange rates were high swiss salaries for immigrant workers were higher based on the fact they had to multiply a home salary by a higher multiple.  The blunt fact is if we dont like the employment market in Switzerland we could always move elsewhere (subject to being able find something better).

			Yes, FL certainly is very quiet but you have a lot of things to do close by.    
Just a short bus ride and you're in Feldkirch (Austria) for cheap shopping, lots of nice towns all along the Rhine valley, St Gallen and Chur not too far away, Zurich only just over an hour by train, the great vineyards of Meinfeld (sp?) and the ski resorts of Pizol, Toggenburg and Flumserberg and Germany just the other side of Bodensee. And of course there's a good art gallery and museum in Vaduz itself and some pretty good food shopping and restaurants.

There are some really good ones on the internet, but you don't get the face-to-face you might need. And, having the Swiss perspective is surely a good thing. Though, I used an American-style resume (no photo, no age/kids/etc. info, though I did include hobbies) and not only got great feedback on it, but received 2 job offers just recently. (yay!) Worth noting that I applied primarily to multinationals and ONGs/UN, so Swiss companies may appreciate the pure Swiss style.

It was already a decade ago at my masters program when the profs were hammering into our heads that kids with learning difficulties (back then it was called transl. ""students with very mild brain dysfunctions"" - dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyslexia, etc.) are actually above average IQs. Smart kids who score poorly on those tests since the test are unfortunately designed for the average population and their mainstream way to learn.    
There has been a good book written a long time ago, there is a whole   devoted to this.    
Now, I do not think a student with poor language skills and maybe his parents as well, will be so successful, knocking on the doors of different apprentice options on their own without a sufficient school record nor some school admin to back them up. Since these companies do save their rare places for the country system. I would advice OP to get hooked with the authorities, the ones we are working with are very supportive and place our students quickly, if the students show interest and determination. The student will be placed in a class for a couple of months based on his orientation (sciences or social studies, art design, etc.) while he is searching his apprentisage and stage options.

Often Switzerland operates on a time lag behind the US and UK. This is the latest flawed attempt at cost-saving by aping what has happened in the US without recognizing the differences between the markets.     By all means negotiate but consider how secure you are. How easy would it be for this company to employ someone else non-EU to fill this position.

			Hi,   
Speaking as a nanny myself, the going rate depends on how many hours per week, if they are going to be declared (so if tax will have to be paid) and if there are any bonuses like health insurance paid for, permit paid for etc. I work 4 days per week and up to 10 hours a day for a reasonable wage. Normal babysitting I charge 25chf per hour and get no complaints, but with a full time job that would be a ridiculous amount of money so I charge ~15chf per hour. It also depends on whether you want an experienced, qualified nanny with first aid certificate and a crb check, or if you want an au-pair. For an au-pair I reckon you could pay between 1,000chf and 1,500chf.   
Try looking on   or just post an advert on EF or on   or  .   
Hope this helps, and good luck!

			Hi Blue,   
From what I can gather you used to be on the portfolio management side but have been moved into sales. Your question is therefore in the context of positioning yourself should you feel like transfering back to an investment advisor or portfolio management role a few years down the road.    
The CFA is a good, well recognised qualification to have on your CV but as you point out, it's a big investment in terms of time and money. So unless you want to do it because you’re bored and are looking for the intellectual challenge, the issue is are you likely to get a return on your investment career-wise?  As you say, from a practical perspective, there’s no point just accumulating diplomas, particularly the more seasoned you become in the financial services industry. After a point it's experience and track record, not paper qualifications, that employers are after and that's what counts on your CV.   
I’m on the IB side, not PB side but here’s my thoughts. The CFA course is useful to you and your employer if you’re in the business of analysing companies. In my experience, people in the IB world who’ve found it relevant to their jobs are specialist equity sales people, equity research analysts and  corporate finance. In a PB world, it would be portfolio managers and investment analysts.    
I have no doubts that people in relevant jobs can benefit from doing the CFA course. In fact, in the past, I’ve agreed, on behalf of my company, to sponsor some key employees to do it. But these have all been people well established on that career path, with a number of years experience and proven aptitude in that role.    
The risk in your position is that you may do the course but never get the opportunity to do the switch either because the opportunity doesn’t come up or maybe your employer thinks that your strengths lie other directions. In that case, you may never get the return on your investment.    
I think you’re right to be concerned that the longer you stay in a generalist sales role, the more difficult it will be to transfer into a specialised role in the future, either with your current employer or any other one. But I have reservations that adding a CFA diploma to your CV will make that any easier if you lack the experience and track record. A CFA might give a rookie the edge when applying to a graduate recruitment programme but when an experienced portfolio manager leaves or a new slot for one comes up, most banks will seek to recruit another experienced portfolio manager from outside rather than considering a lateral internal transfer of a generalist, albeit one with a CFA. I know I would.    
So before committing to a CFA, if I were you, I would choose an appropriate time to have a heart to heart with your employer. As part of your career goals you could tell him that you’d like to keep your options open to return to the Investment adviser/portfolio manager side at some stage in the future and that as part of that planning, you’re considering doing a CFA. I think you need their input to see if they think you have the aptitude for those roles and whether they would entertain/support a switch if an appropriate opportunity came up.    
For what it’s worth, I think for the path you want to follow, the CFA is much more relevant than the FRM or the CAIA. They are quite specialised and I’d only consider them if you were thinking about moving to a role where they’re relevant in the near future. In fact as regards the FRM, I’d much rather teach people on the job. Risk management is more about instilling the right culture. No course I’ve come across has been able to do that to my satisfaction.

Yes, I know I'm lucky to be on a good whack as a salary but I also see the writing on the wall: the current management team is obsessed with outsourcing to the Third World. So whilst I haven't yet been told to get my coat, internal career opportunities have evaporated. Recruitment around the City is quiet in IT so I'm looking elsewhere. I was targeting HK/Singapore with 10-15% tax.    
With the widely purported 'great lifestyle' and image of rich living in CH [before researching] I was expecting to score a similar level salary with that being balanced out by the higher CoL / lower tax burn.

Although this message was 2 years ago, just want to know if you were able to get any help.  I just arrived end of 2009 to CH (Lausanne) and also have a Fashion Industry background.  I am a Production Mgr looking also to find something in the Supply Chain field. Would appreciate any help here.  I have had not too much luck on my end so far.   
Thanks,

As another poster has since said, it's in their interest to get people employed, so it's disappointing that they are not a little more forthcoming with assistance measures like this.

4495	Employment	Change career: Banking?	seyon	1439	8	Olten	20.03.2010, 18:01	"    There's no point sending your CV to the HR folks. Most business units - Equity Research, Corporate Finance and Trading etc manage their own graduate recruitment process so you have to contact each dept. directly. You could write to HR and ask when these departments have their graduate recruitment cycles (they are often uncoordinated) and for contact names for each department ops officer. Other than that, HR is the wrong place to direct your efforts.   
With your skills (you have industry experience which transferable), Equity Research (analysing chemical companies or pharmaceuticals) might be a good place to target though it might be a good idea to think about an MBA first (you presumably lack financial analysis skills) -  INSEAD, LSE  or a good Swiss school (search the forum  threads for discussion on those). Once established in the Equity Research area, doors might eventually open into corporate finance since they often recruit from the Research department to fill slots in the industry speciality groups.   
As for investment banks - it's the usual cast of characters - UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutche Bank, HSBC, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Soc Gen etc. Do some research on the investment banking sector.   
Can't help on the insurance sector. Not my ball game.

			From my personal point of view it is very competitive world and as much as employer makes their own calculated offers to the stuff they hire, you also have a right to pursue better offers on the market. In order to prevent breach of conduct scenario the comapnies have codes of conducts put in place which clearly stipulate what they view as an infringement. I have gone through such routine online programme presenting multiple scenarios of how the laws can be violeted by emploees of ""xyz"" companies related to clients and competitors. You just had to answer the questionaire to pass it  .   
I do not think the client company would take an open risk to hire you on the basis of knowledge of inside information as there clearly be some legal implications. Most likely they are interested in your skills, work style and ability to solve similar problems within their own working environement and organization. Many people have done that before and transferred.    
There is also workplace factor coming in and I would be very open and honest with my previous employer plus workmates about my move to the new company. It is good to preserve good relationship, contacts, get references and not to burn bridges behind, especially in a niche market.

How you should proceed (how much musical theory to learn, schools, teachers, what kind of guitar and equipment you will need and more) imo strongly depends on your musical interests, the style you want to start off with. If you want to be a classical, flamenco/rumba, rock/punk/metal, jazz, singer/songwriter, whatever player will lead you on different paths to your first paid gig.   
I think, you should get yourself the best teacher, that you can afford. He or she can constantly assess your progress, talents and weaknesses and will imho be your fastest track to any success, if you are serious about wanting to be a professional.

			Chiming in - perhaps too late.    
If you are looking at international organizations - you would be earning tax free; that explains why most salaries in the orgs are low comparatively the free markets -where you have to keep in mind that as much as 25-30% will disappear in taxes and so.   
Otherwise, in the commercial world, lawyers are quite nicely paid. I cannot disclose too much - drop me a note in PM if you want - but depending on your seniority level, I'd think a 128k CHF a low low end. Of course, some corporations will be willing to chip in higher salaries, but I would expect an entrance in the 150k. Senior legal with dep. responsabilities in a large company will be   beyond 200K.

2. Coming from the UK, what should form part of my relocation package?

   Do you or your spouse already have a job offer there?  The work permit situation gives preference to EU over non-EU citizens.  It is not impossible 
to get a job, just a bit harder if you are outside of Geneva.   
   With a CPA, you certainly have a good chance to get a job with 
an international company where English is the working language.  Local 
companies will require a high level of French.   
P.S.  I have a house in Houston

			I am from Texas as well.  There are pluses and minuses with living in a foreign country.  In Geneva, the people in general do not want to speak 
English.  It is good for your French, but sometimes you just feel like speaking your own language.   
Geneva is a nice city with much nature around it if you like skiing 
and hiking.     
I say:  Take the chance.  If it doesn't work out, you can easily 
move back to Texas.

Apparently its a major pronunciation issue..... as a side note I'm not sexists and don't believe in doing the  gender changing thingy    
Thanks for moving the thread to a more appropriate place, but i felt this was a visa issue. I mean getting a job can be difficult in any country, it was more about would i be allowed to work there, wouldn't i stand a better chance of being offered a job if I had the correct visa or do companies not really mind sponsoring you? Is this not a big deal? I heard I may work if it's part of a study requirement.... CFA has a three year experience requirement, do you think i could push this angle?   
Angela she is Swiss German so i guess that part?

4548	Employment	Reasonable salary for Zurich a single in tech sector	Julkr	2304	2	Zurich	23.02.2010, 00:09	"    Use a very simple rule of thumb:   
USA:  The real median earnings of men who worked full time, year-round climbed between 2006 and 2007, from $43,460 to $45,113.  
Source:    
CH: Average income is 60,000 CHF   
You were on 100k USD, or 2.2x the avg US wage 
CH equivalent would thus be 132k CHF   
Your offer of 100k CHF + 15% = 115k CHF = 13% lower then your current job (approx)   
NOTE: this is very much an approximation. Modify with average California wage and average Zurich wage for better figures (Google is your friend)   
Other sources like   state avg salary in CH, no mgmt position, in 2008, with some technical training = 7k CHF to 8kCHF monthly, = 84k CHF to 96k CHF pa   
This   comes up with around 6.5k monthly = 78k CHF pa, if you punch in 1yr experience, 24yr old person, technical training, etc...   
HOWEVER: the value of working in Switzerland can be immeasurable (lifestyle, outdoor activities, exposure to multiple languages and cultures) so you must make up your own mind....

If you are giving up a job in the US, be prepared for at least 6 months unemployment over here. A swiss address is unlikely to help much.   
On the practical side, Swiss CVs tend to be longer (2-3 pages) than US ones and include your photo, marital status and visa/permit status.

In the end I got the job, the agency who had put me forward with my knowledge got their fee (afterall they'd done all the prep work and supplied me with all the job info etc) the other agency who had done nothing but send my CV off without me knowing got a nasty phonecall from me, I've never used them since and I made sure to tell other people I knew who were job hunting at the time not to use them. I'm not going to name and shame the offending agency but lets put it this way they are a large international finance recruiting agency and they should have known better!!    
So as a warning to the OP yes it sometimes happens that agencies or individuals representing the agency are unprofessional. However there is nothing stopping you from registering with multiple agencies just make sure you keep a note of which agency is representing you for which job.

			Annual leave always refers to working days, in my experience. I'm very fortunate to have quite a lot more than 20 days per annum, but even at 20, imogen isn't doing badly -- most countries outside the UK offer around that level, and of course the US is notorious for its stingy leave provisions.   
imogen, if you're lucky, your company will also offer ""bridging days"" -- an extra day's leave when a public holiday (they're only ""bank"" holidays in the UK and Ireland!) falls on a Tuesday or Thursday. And anyway, you'll be paid in CHF rather than pounds -- there's a big upside!

			Hi there,   
I am a EU 27 student in Switzerland, holding a student B permit, allowing me to work up to 15 hours per week, for Geneve up to 20 as far as I know.   
I was wondering if I find a job in a company, which is more than 20 hours per week, is it too big paper work to do, and are the companies generally ready to do sth like this for one employee?   
If you have any experience with this, would appreciate if you share it.   
Have a good one, 
V.

4583	Employment	Advice on job prospects - Geneva, Lausanne - for Editor/TEFL teacher	Eoin	1839	0	Ireland	04.02.2010, 23:31	" 
			
			Hi there,   
I'm hoping to move to the French speaking part of Switzerland in March to look for work. My girlfriend is Swiss and there's not much work in Ireland.    
I intend to enroll in French classes in Lausanne to study for the DELF and I'll have enough money to last for about three months. I have lower intermediate French at the moment.    
I am a bit concerned about job prospects though.    
I'm an editor and journalist by trade, with good qualifications and eight years experience working with magazines, brochures, newsletters and websites.    
I also hold a CELTA Pass B, though do not much teaching experience.   
I was thinking that between some freelance editorial work and some freelance English teaching I might be able to pay the bills, while looking for something more permanent in one of the NGOs or international companies based there. Just wondering how realistic is this notion?    
Any advice or tips greatly appreciated.

			Depends. If its a student B permit then you are allowed to be just that. A student. If its an unrestricted B permit then you have no problem in working. Otherwise you must find an employer who is willing to take the hassle to change your permit especially if you are non-EU

			Hi there   
Well I am certainly available for work all of the time. I have a spreadsheet with the companies and dates (ncluding methods) of application for all the job advert replies & letters I have written so far. I have copies of most of the emails I have sent as way of application and a number of the emailed responses I have received. I haven't however kept any of the rejection letters I have received by post.   
I thought it was a bit odd that I could claim from the UK when I am living here in Switzerland. I know that I can work for 3 months here in Switzerland and then claim 'chomage' as I was told that in the local canton offices due to the length of time I have already spent working in the UK prior to my move here. Additionally I have met someone here from Spain who is claiming benefits from Spain even though she is living here and looking for work here so I just wondered whether it would be the same for me...it seems not unfortunately.   
I am not fluent yet in French but I can certainly get by. My French written skills are not up to the same standard as my spoken ones but I am working hard on improving that side. Since I have moved here, my French has definitely improved a great deal and will only get better unless I regress and stop trying to speak to my girlfriend's family and friends (pretty sure that is highly unlikely).   
So...I am looking for work on a daily basis. At present the most important thing is for me to find a job in any domain while my French improves. If I can find a great job to begin with where fluent French is not required then great but I would be willing to do more or less anything.   
Right...back to trawling through websites etc for jobs   
Thanks

Ok you want advice: enrol in a German class today and start tomorrow, preferably an intensive one. After that you can say you are learning German at least. Call recruitment agents and talk to them. If they like your story, they may be able to sell you more effectively to the recruiter. Apply for every job where the advert is written in English. German is clearly a lower priority in these roles. In your cover letter tell them you are serious about learning German and have enrolled in a course.

2 quick questions which didn't jump out at me from a brief trawl through the archives :-     
1) Unemployed C-permit holder in Zurich - married supporting 2 kids. Assuming eligibility to full benefits is confirmed - does that equate to 80% of last salary capped at 8K / month for max 24 months ??   
2) Is the above net of tax or is it gross and you still submit an annual tax return as per normal for C permit holder ?

			They can very well refuse you to take holiday. It is up to the employer to decide when you may take your holiday. They should take your wishes into consideration and they have to grant you minimum 2 weeks in a row at one point during the year. But at the end of the day, it is the company that calls the shot.   
If you leave and have accrued holiday it will simply be paid out.

4643	Employment	Notice Period	NotAllThere	2886	8	Baselland	11.01.2010, 20:18	" 
			
			Thanks for the responses. When I saw the contract, I was a bit surprised, as I'd only expect a three month notice period for ""degree level"" positions, not for ""menial"" work. ( Just using those phrases to indicate the type of work, not the worth of the work, nor the worth of the people doing that work   ).   
It is not a big issue, just a surprise.       In the UK, it's almost impossible to enforce notice periods beyond the payment period.  ( It falls foul of anti-slavery laws - you can't make someone work ).  Within the payment period, the employer can either let you go (and not pay you), or pay you and prevent you taking up the new job - but they can't make you go into work, so may be forced to give you ""gardening leave"".  If they go down the gardening leave route and you go to work for the other place immediately, they can only sue you for their costs in replacing you within the notice period.  The only exception is if you're going to the competition and could unfairly use your knowledge against your original employer.  And even then it's   difficult for the employer to win.  Most employers in the UK rely on people's ignorance, or sense of playing fair.

4646	Employment	What should be included on a job application for Switzerland [P&G]	kimba1	2056	0	Melbourne-previously Lausanne	11.01.2010, 18:13	" 
			
			Hello all,    
I was wondering if some knowledgeable EF'ers can help me with a query.    
I have seen a position that i would like to apply for with Proctor and Gamble in Geneva, however i am not sure precisely what to include in my application.    
The position states that i can apply via their website and requests the following:   
""Further information you need to know for your application   
·         Just apply online via clicking the button below 
·         Attach your CV in English (include examples of the challenging experiences you have had both within and outside academia) 
·         Attach a summary of your latest grades 
·         Please note individual attachments cannot be larger than 100 KB each""   
I guess i just wanted advice on what the 'done thing' was when applying for English speaking companies in Switzerland. For eg. while they don't ask specifically for a letter of motivation, point 2 (specifically their request for examples of challenging experiences i've had) surely should be written in a letter format and not somehow squeezed into my CV. Or should it?   
As for the summary of my latest grades (the post is for an internship), can i just attach my University results transcript?    
Do i somehow attach a photograph (as appears to be appropriate for Swiss companies)?   
You advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I am new to all this and desperately want to find work here in Switzerland.    
Thanking you in advance.

My wife is currently looking for leads for a job in the french region of Switzerland as a pet groomer.   
She has 6 years experience working with animals - worked in grayhound race kennels, two different grooming salons in Brussels and does volunteer work at the local kennel grooming/re-educating dogs and cats for adoption. She also has vet training (no, she is not a vet), animal behaviour training/experience, small business training and several years in administration (previous career as administrator before changing to her ""dream job"" with animals).   
If anyone can point her to a company that will be looking for an EU national (France) for a start in the summer she would appreciate it very much.

I am a Canadian University student in an iBA program majoring in French Studies, minoring in English, and working on a D-TEIL (Discipline of Teaching English as an International Language) Certificate. Next year I am going on a six-month exchange to the University of Lausanne to complete my degree. Afterwards, I plan on going to teacher's college to obtain my BEd.   
After all of this is said and done, I plan on moving to Switzerland to become a teacher. I would be either an English teacher, French teacher, or regular primary school teacher. Hopefully...   
I just wanted to know if the Canadian BEd and D-TEIL would be recognized in Switzerland, especially considering part of my degree will have been earned in a Swiss university. I also have plenty of teaching experience with the primary age group.   
I have read many posts but I thought that posting my own would help me out more specifically. I would greatly appreciate any advice and/or experiences!

4664	Employment	cover letter for CV. how long??	jojo	6336	4	Lac leman Region	17.03.2007, 17:26	" 
			
			A good covering letter will literally cover any problem areas and complex issues and explain them - thus making the CV more likely to be read.  
      Covering letters introduce your CV. They are there to induce the reader to go on and read the CV, and to explain away any 'difficult' areas in the CV that might otherwise be off-putting.        
      They tell the reader why you want the job, why they should interview you, and that you are available. A good covering letter will make the impression that your CV is a good one, and that you are therefore an excellent candidate. It allows you the room to explain anything that isn't obvious, that needs clarification, etc.        
      If the CV is a sales pitch for yourself, the covering letter is a sales pitch for the CV. The CV is a tool to get you an interview, and the covering letter a tool to get the CV noticed for the right reasons. Preparing a good, personalised covering letter takes time, but it is a worthwhile investment.   "	254	 Oct 2006	4	['0', '0']	['29', '25']	0

Local hires got a starting salary of between 110'000 and 135'000 CHF a year.  One guy got a sign on bonus to help with educational costs.  Those on the higher salary were operating as team leads, with up to 20 developers on their teams.  Those on the lower were specialists in various SAP areas, but no team responsibility.   They did get relocation, but this was during a staffing ramp up.  IIRC, we were still offering relocation in 2004.   
Age also affected the initial salary - the older you were, the higher the salary.  Though not by much.   
One guy I recruited in 2002 has, over 8 years, increased his salary (same grade) only be 4%.     
So, 120'000CHF for a SAP specialist sounds about right.     
For the OP, 120'000CHF + car allowance + up to 20% bonus is a pretty good deal.

Kidding aside, many firms permit first-class rail travel because it offers more privacy and an opportunity to use the time on the train as working time.  On intercity trains, it also means that you can plug into an electrical outlet to keep your laptop charged up.   
Even if the costs were equal, the equation shifts towards train travel because it means you can multitask.  If the idiots on their cellphones are anything to judge by, multitasking is less effective for drivers.     
Personally, I never drive when I can take the train.  So much less stressful!

I have a question and I hope you guys can help me. 
My husband worked for almost 4 years in a company near Bern. Now he just started working in Liechtenstein but we will still live in Switzerland. 
If in the future he gets unemplyed or quits the job, or suffers and accident or get sick, or anything and can't work, does he still have any rights from the swiss government since we're still leaving in Switzerland? 
Thanks a lot....

			On the holiday question.   
You get 5 days paid holiday for every 3 months you are with the RAV. 
Any other holiday you have to declare on the form you fill out at the end of the month. This will not be paid and you are still expected to look for work in the holiday period.   
Effectively you can take a month off as holiday, you will not be paid for it and you must still prove you have looked for work.

4693	Employment	Laid off/made redundant but still have 25 days holiday	alfred13	5576	50	basel	05.12.2009, 01:45	"    Actually, it works exactly this way. If you work all your notice period and you still have vacations left, the company must pay them. They also can force you to burn your vacations days. So, this ends up being negotiated when the employee is dismissed. Also note that by law, you have to take at least 2 week uninterrupted time of vacation, and most times employers ""might"" show some flexibility because they don't know they might run into problems if this is raised to the inspection.    
Without trying to set myself as an example, I had to work until the very last day of my contract and got almost 50 days of paid vacation. So, it is not the proverbial anything, but just an agreement you do with you future to be former employee depending on   business needs.

Regardless of industry, most clients don't have a clue about actual time spent on the project. Agencies and the self employed generally use the term   to justify to their client / employer how much time was spent doing what.    
In future, perhaps, make a note how long it takes to vacuum the place; to do the bathroom, kitchen, stairs and windows. Doing it once or twice at a moderate pace should indicate you need X minutes for each task. Make a note or chart.    
Next time Mr / Mrs Irate Client starts to yell, pull your chart out of your bag and present it. ""I can cut corners cleaning the windows, Bud, but you're going to notice the effect. You tell me - it's your money - what priority I should give to the parquet wax, hmm?""   
It's really important in Service to be able to say ""No"" to the client so they know what is reasonable.

It doesn't hurt if you try some networking even if your friends are too young, they might know a friend of a friend of... and even if they can't offer you a job, they can offer you tips and give you some hints on what worked for them, who to contact, where to search, etc. also now that you have free time try to prepare yourself to integrate better and open more doors, ie. learn french.   
Mmm and back to the topic, I work now, but when is the weekend specially sunday and the weather is so bad that I feel like doing nothing, I just listen to music, read, watch videos, chat with my family and friends, and if I'm in the mood I prepare a fancy dish or a dessert, or go out with friends and maybe some sports.

From day 91 to the day before you give birth, you will get a proportion paid by the employer and the insurance kicks in to cover the rest (making up to 90% of your normal wage, I think).   
From the day the child is born, maternity coverage and rights kick in.

I'm Christ, new member on this forum, living in Geneva. 
I came from Spain this august and since then I am unemployed. My wife applied for a residance permit 3 months ago and we still have no idea of the state of her request. My wife is an EU2 citizen, from Romania and I have an european permanent residance and working permit in Spain. 
Unlike her, I do not have an european passport and since I couldn't find a job, nor the possibility of applying for a residance/working permit.  
Three weeks ago our daughter was born.   
For those who know and can help me with an answer, I ask a question: how long it takes to get a residance permit? And for those who can help me with a job of any kind (with or without contract), I'd be really grateful.   
Thanks.

			If it's primary school the regulations are canton-based. In Zurich they recently changed the regulations so German language proficiency is not required - you can get an 'approval' of some sort even if you don't have German, to be a primary school teacher - of course, then it's up to the school whether to employ you - your prospective employer will have to submit all the paperwork to have you approved...   
""Preschool"" is different to ""Kindergarten"" under the regulations - hmmm - but some 'kindergartens' come under the canton (as part of primary school), and others under a federal regulation system which applies also to child-care, creche, 'krippe', 'day-care' etc...and the requirements for that will be different again...   
From what I understand, it's a lot easier for the schools to get international teachers approved in Canton zurich, for the primary school, than to get early childhood teachers approved at the federal level, but that may also depend on who you talk to, and what they are familiar with (it's an expertise in itself to comply with all the necessary regulations and run a school, that is for sure!)...and of course it will all depend on teacher availability and your ability to fulfil their expectations...

			Hi,   
I moved 1 month ago in Zurich, with my boyfriend who found a job here. 
Problem is, I don't speak german (english and french). 
Do you know if it's possible to find a junior role here (first difficulty) in a front office position (sales would be the best) without speaking german?   
I am quite worried as every job ad I see mentions German mandatory, but my boyfriend and an other friend are now working here without speaking a word of german.   
Insiders advices are welcomed!

			Hi and welcome on this forum (and soon in Switzerland...   )   
I think you have to possibilities : International schools / private schools or state schools.   
For state school you need to have a diploma recognized by Switzerland.   
About the other possibilites, they have their own rules I think. You should try to contact them.   
I'm sure you will have more precise information from other members     
Good luck with your project.

			Look beyond the money? Is the job worth more? Will you be working on more challenging/interesting projects? Will the perks be better? Will your family like life in Zurich?    
We moved from Montreux to Zug and it is surprising what a difference there is in the weather! Just a few hundred km north and it certainly feels more overcast, less sunny.    
Ticino is what Italian? Do you speak German? Does your wife? Will the kids have to learn a new language? Don't under estimate this; you will be miserable if your family is.   
I am looking at the prospect of having to work away from my family only cause circumstances demand it. I would NEVER choose to do so. You only live once, and your kids will be older and not interested in spending time with Dad in a blink of an eye.

			Thanks everyone for your comments.   
I can see how my question/idea is being greedy. Thanks for pointing that out ... and opening my eyes to it. I appreciate it.   
At this point my employer has told me that my position is being made resundant, but hasn't given me anything in writing to sign or acknowledge officially. I assume there'll be some sort of paper that has the official date of notice on it? Is this right? Will the ""3 month notice period"" start as of this official date or should I regard the conversation I had with my boss as the official date.   
I have started looking for other employment. It's been 3 weeks and there are some nice jobs out there where I could provide a company with benefit. I've already applied at some!   
I've been here 3 years and have been paying into the unemployment system ... so when I qualify for unemployment benefits, I intend to benefit from them. I don't mean to cheat the system nor ""pull a fast one"". I am being open and upfront about how to handle this. It's my first time being laid off so I don't know all the ins-and-outs.   
Regarding being ""greedy"". I don't mean to point fingers here, but perhaps I've been conditioned to think this way by my employer. When I relocated here here from the US I was not given a cost of living adjustment, nor was I paid commissions that were due to me from my previous position with the company in their US office. I've learned from this and so perhaps now I think in terms of ""negotiating"" with my company to ensure I get the best possible deal for me (and them) to create a win-win scenario ... rather than me being screwed by them. I'm sorry I feel this way (now), but this is how it is.   
I realize in this case I'm suggesting that rather than paying me my 3 months salary over 3 months I'm asking for it to be paid in one lump sum (and then not have to go to work in a position that is obsolete anyway). If this is not allowed, or normal, than OK. BTW - my contract does not stipulate anything about this. I've been there 10+ years so I know I will get 3 months (per Swiss law).   
Thanks again to those who have provided their response/opinion.

And assuming you do have assets in the bank then even if you are not liable for income tax, you would be liable for weath tax.   
Course by the time you do qualify for social security you would likely not be able to afford to move any of your belongings out of the country with you too.   
I think the answer to the question maybe tied up with your nationality and circumstances, with a sliding scale. EU with kids I would imagine would be pretty low down on the list, with say single, non EU at the top.

			This is true. About 8 years ago, I was refused Unemployment benefit (I had been working outside of CH for over 18 months and my contributions were 1 month too little to qualify for RAV)   
The social security people found me work with the refuge collection department for about 5 months. (60 percent work)   
They calculated a family budget for about 5200 chf (my wife, myself and my stepson)   
My wife was earning 1800 chf in a part time job, and the money we earned was deducted from this budget and we received the extra top up.   
Once I found a job back in IT we had to repay all the money we were given. Better system than in the UK in my opinion.     
It was not as bad as it sounds. The job was hard work and really cold over Winter, but the people I worked with were very friendly and at the end of it, I was very fit and positive - but glad to get back to my ""normal"" work.

			Hello All,   
I am a Freelancer and after having worked for a number of years through my own Limited Company around Europe I am looking at an offer in Switzerland.   
Due to the nature of the Swiss laws, one must be employed by a third party company to be compliant with Swiss laws. I have created some good relationships with UK Umbrella companies from my previous years of dealing with them, but none of those can assist me in Switzerland.   
My main interest is net retention, the higher the better, at the same time I do not wish to have any compliance issues.   
Can anyone recommend an Umbrella Company suitable for the Swiss Market ??

i think for jobs that are 100k plus the waiting time is probably longer ( i would imagine) as majority of my friends (where i took the sample from) have graduated uni in 2005-2006 and have about 2-3 year work experience outside of switzerland (canada, states, UK and france)

It is probably the worst time now to negotiate conditions, companies have the upper hand right now, and they know it. If you accept under 100K, don't expect to be eating out (kebabs exlcuded).

I am new to this forum since I am considering relocating from London to somewhere a lot more pleasant like Geneva.   
I work in the charity sector as a fundraiser, but I'm keen to leave this area of work and use my journalism/ PR/ communication training and experience to find a new job. Would like to stay in the NGO sector, but am open to options.

4784	Employment	Using hyperlinks within a CV	patrious45	1972	3	lausanne	22.10.2009, 10:43	" 
			
			I've written extensively in my field over the years, so there are plenty of hyper-links in my CV.   
However, I am concious of when my CV is not in PDF format, especially with recruitment consultants, many of whom tend to cut and paste and make a mess of things. So what I do is keep the hyper-links separate, and simply keep them as footnotes, which should in theory limit whatever pig's ear of a mess that a recruitment agent may make of them.   
A separate option, that I have considered, is to compile links to books on Amazon or copies of articles written in a separate document, as one does with references and qualifications.   
I would agree that very few will actually click on the links - they're a bit like references or qualifications, in that you have presented evidence you are willing to stand over and much of the time they are happy enough with that and won't actually verify them. So in that respect, they're a good thing.

			20% is a bit of a jump, especially in the present market - I would seek a raise but leave it to them as to how much. Tying it into career progression, as has been suggested, is also a good idea.   
Once they come back to you with a figure (say a much lower one like 3% or even zero) you can respond with   - I've found this to be an excellent way in the past of rattling an employers cage without making any ultimatums or direct threats. Either they will come back to you with an increased figure or they won't - accept it either way (a raise is a raise).   
If not (or still far too low) then I certainly would look to jumping ship as you have essentially hit a glass ceiling in that company. Sometimes, especially early on in a career, you have to move companies to get the big rises as employers still see you in terms of who you were when you joined rather than who you have become.

4788	Employment	Can they cut his salary and what if this leads to stress leave?	sloaneytiger	1391	0	Vaud	21.10.2009, 20:52	" 
			
			My husband has recently been given a large salary cut and the employer says legally only they have to sign the letter and he does not have to sign a letter of acceptance of this cut.  As his job is largely based on commission, his contract does say that if performance decreaases, they can cut his salary.  Unfortunately there is no cap in the salary cut in the contract and no cap on time frame.    He can go and see an employment lawyer but legally as he has signed this contract, is there anything he can do about the salary cut?  He is on a fixed term contract so they will not make him redundant as if they did they would then have to legally pay him out of his contract, something of course they dont want to do.  If he gives his notice, he will at this stage lose some potentially valuable shares, unless he manages to get an agreement with them on this.  In the meantime, he can either show up for work, do nothing and accept the huge pay cut until he manages to find another job or he can get a letter from the doctor as has been under  huge stress regarding this lately.     
Does any one know about the salary cut legalities in Switzerland and also whether it would benefit him to take stress leave rather than turn up for work?  I presume he would still only receive the cut salary even if he was on stress leave.     
Lastly, if he did resign because of this salary cut, can he still not claim unemployment for 3 months, despite the employer effectively forcing him to resign?   
Thanks a lot in advance for anyone who can help.

			I *think*, you can claim benefits from Switzerland whgile living in the UK for up to 3 months, but I am far from sure about that.  As soon as you have your notice, register with RAV, and start applying for AT LEAST 10 jobs per month. The counter is running from when you see, you are going to loose yourr job, not from the day you are out of your job.   
Apply for an E301 form immediately. I had 1 sent from the UK, and went through 2 months without money, because they had a 2 months backlog,  but  I would expect the Swiss to be more effective.    
UK Rules may be different, so just in case you have worked in other countries in the last 5 years, I would also request an E301 form from there.   
Good luck finding a new job.

			I agree with Nev and the other posters, on all the points outlined above.   
I moved here 2 years ago to a ""local"" contract also. The salary at the time was definitely a big draw for me, even within the same company there was a significant difference between what I earned before and what I would earn when I came to Switzerland.   
But not having a relocation package severely bit into my savings coming here, and although the company has a relocation management team, it was not available to me because I was not on an expat contract.   
It differs for everyone of course, but I found the first couple of months incredibly difficult - but what doesn't kill makes you stronger, right?    
My advice is if you take the plunge and decide to come over on the local contract, then haggle as best you can with them for some kind of relocation support. I wish I had done it.

			Hello everyone,   
I was trying to find some information, which would help me to better understand my options, but I still miss the clarity. 
My situation is quite complex from a legal perspective, I guess. I was employed with a company based in Geneva, I worked there for 1,5 year on permit B (the one not bound to employer, valid untill 2011), but early this year I left for studies in a different canton. My work contract was put ""on hold"", though I do not have any papers which would prove it. I have not been registered in my new location, neither I've been paying taxes, since I get no salary. I am still registered in Geneva. Now it looks like my company would not be able to renew my contract after I finish my studies, due to cost cutting and restrucutring. For me the questions arise in this regard:   
1) Am I entitled for any benefits in this case? If yes, how they will be calculated (as far as I understood from the threads I read on the topic, amount is normally based on the average salary for the past 12 months, but I had no salary for almost 10...) 
2) Are there any legal risks involved if I go to the Swiss authorities and describe my situation? Theoretically, I should have registered in my new canton... Can Geneva authorities decide to terminate my permit because of that? 
3) As far as I know, getting unemployment benefits can worsen one's chances to get a permit C on time. Is that true?    
Many thanks in advance for your answers!

			Welcome to EF, valesol!   
Unfortunately most of the denizens of EF are on the receiving end of psychiatry, so are less than qualified to respond.  Can you approach some hospitals here to get a feel for the numbers?  There is at least one state psych hospital in every canton, and they wouldn't be coy about mentioning salaries.  That'll give you a base line for private practice.   
Salaries in Switzerland are usually well in excess of those in most other countries.  Depending on where you plan on living in Switzerland, 300k+ would provide a very comfortable lifestyle.  (I scrape by on little more than double that, but strings of polo ponies don't come cheap, especially when stabled individually on the mezzanine floor of my urban palazzo.)   
With regard to speaking German, it sounds like you'll blitz it (pun intended).  Don't worry too much about the language.  It will come quickly.   
Sorry not to be any more help.  I think asking the income question directly of those in the know would be your best bet.  Do you attend the EPA Congress?  That may be a good spot to ask around.

I would preferably like to find an agency who specialises (or with experience in) pharma/medical devices etc.    
ANYONE who has had a positive expereince with such a company please let me know?? Its very hard to just deal with websites, when you are not quite sure yet what it is you want to do, and even less sure what it is people are looking for!!!   
Thanks in advance!!

4819	Employment	Paying Employment Agencies	markalex	3468	26	Vaud	02.10.2009, 12:52	"    Ok, but MarieZug it is not working no? I have been looking for just over a year now, about a dozen interviews but sadly no offers. None of the agencies you mentioned have come back with anything in that time, absolutely nothing, I have found every lead myself.   
But hey that not working either, at least I am not picking up the right leads. In the summer of 2010 my unemployment will finish and I will be faced with the decision of when to sell my house to simply have money to eat and pay my rent, if next spring is as successful as this was, not.   
I read that the great majority of jobs are not advertised, so how do companies manage their recruitment? I never been asked to recommend somebody for a new job (except by an agency). I read on the EF that one of the most difficult things to do if you are running your own company is to find reliable people to employ?    
Its true that you rarely see senior positions advertised, so how is this working? Surely thru different agencies?

			Hi   
I've been offered an invterview in Geneva with a firm of IFAs called Forth Capital. I've googled them and found limited information regarding them. Does anybody here have any experience of FC either as an employee or as a client?   
Any feedback would be much appreciated.

You'll also benefit from lower tax rates and being jointly taxed as a married couple, especially if your wife doesn't earn much. And as previously stated, your QoL here will be better.

I'm a German/Canadian 26 y/o living in London and I'm thinking of moving to Switzerland next year.    
I am taking French lessons as I want to move to Lausanne area. Any advice out there--except to look for a job in an American company?   
Ideally what I would like to do is come out and work as a Personal PA/House Manager/Nanny for a family or couple.    
I have 5 years of experience in Communications/Marketing and I'm very organized, outgoing and good at getting things accomplished. I love helping people which is probably why I would like this kind of role.    
I have a driver's license (or rather I'm just completing the switch over) and I can speak English, Spanish and a bit of German and French.    
If anyone has advice on how to get this kind of work, or knows someone who wants this kind of person, please do let me know. I am still open to looking for jobs in companies like Nestle, but I thought a bit of a change would be nice and I know I would be good at it.   
Thank you for all your comments ahead of time.

			Hello,   
Staring salaries are always higher for PhDs but you have to be careful -- in Europe there is a certain 'prejudice'  among HR and recruiters (except for scientific research fields) that PhDs are an unnecessary extra cost. 
So it can work against you.  If you look on a  where PhD degrees are often requested, you'll see that opportunities in e-learning and communications rarely request a doctoral degree.  However the big companies that recruit this type of role almost all have programs or means by which you can do your PhD while working at the company. 
Without talking figures, because this depends company to company, institution to institution, the 'money value' or total compensation is much higher if you take a job at a top company and complete your PhD while working for that company.  The starting salary will be lower than if you went into the company with a PhD, but it is likely you will get a much BETTER job, because from the company's HR perspective, you are a much better deal WITHOUT a PhD.  In the end, if once inside the company you do your PhD, chances are it is a MUCH BETTER deal for you -- the company will foot most or all of the costs of your studies, AND you'll get the raise that goes with having the degree.

			To answer the questioin, it would not be easy to find a job.    
The labour market for Romanian citizens is restricted, there is a limit for the number of permits that can be issued and also the employer has to not only get a permit for you, but also prove that they could not find a Swiss or old-EU citizen for that position. I don't know what kind of education or special skills you have, so I'm not saying it's impossible, but as you don't speak German and French and your English is also somewhat limited, then it will not be easy.

			Hi,   
I hope some of you had to make a similar choice and maybe can help me out in the following situation.   
From November this year my girlfriend and I (both Dutch citizens) will be living in Zurich. My girlfriend will be employed by the university. I will move with her to Zurich, but will keep working for my current employer in The Netherlands, for 1 or 2 days a week. Next to this I will search for work in Zurich   
We are now thinking what kind of 'contract' would be best for me for my Dutch work: employed by the Dutch company or work as a freelancer.   
I guess, when I am employed by a Dutch company, I have to pay taxes in The Netherlands, right? Then I don't pay any taxes in Switzerland?   
Probably it is better for me if I only pay taxes in Switzerland. Maybe this poosible as freelancer? When I don't have a formal contract but do freelance work for a Dutch company, then I (only) pay taxes in Switzerland (Zurich)? Is it easy to work as a freelancer in Switzerland (somewhere I read you must have at least 3 unrelated clients to work as a freelancer? or did I mix up with something else? what do you have to arrange to work as a freelancer)?   
Does anyone know what the income tax rate in Zurich is?   
Or which other things do you need to arrange as a freelancer (insurances, ...)?   
Many thanks for your help!   
Kind regards, 
Nico

			This would be the sort of stories   would like to investigate. I have seen as of late a growing number of stories on employees being abused by the employers. It would probably would allow some visibility, without names being quoted and the authorities pulled into the matter. It is a well respected institution in CH.

A very very rough estimation will be around 8000-8500 net per month.    	1	 Sep 2009	0	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

			Not quite AVS, but.... I know if you leave your employer and the country you get your pension back n cash. Not sure why you would want to keep it here given the interest payed in CHF is very very low unless you really plan to come back.    
If you are a NON-EU coming back maybe difficult...

4868	Employment	Working from abroad for a swiss company, what about taxes...	Gaggiol0	1441	4	Basel	10.09.2009, 12:41	" 
			
			Italian nationality. 
My company accountant told me that social security is to be paid where the company is, so i'd be paying that to Switzerland providence even if I reside abroad because I'd still be working remotely for a Swiss company. What I can get is just the bare bone taxes, but i will need to pay them in the residence country.   
Anyway living out of Switzerland with Swiss social security isn't that bad, I may consider the option. 
So the conclusion is that taxes are paid where you reside and social security contribution are paid where the company is, it doesn't sound complicate in the end, indeed it sounds rather logic and convenient. Another valuable information to record in this forum  .   
Thanks.

Well I'm very close with 1 Swiss Company which I applied directly. 
I was close with another, although they changed languages requirement and no longer need my skills.   
Well Knowing they don't have to pay someone 10-15% of the yearly salary, plus more if the applicant accept low salary.... It's better for them!   
I would suggest you target the companies you want (if possible, it's difficult sometimes to know what IT department is doing) and call secretary or send CV... Or check on Linkedin and try to grab some names and google them... (its paying to contact people on linkedin, that sucks)

			A friend of mine has been working for top big international banks for last 15 years all over the world and lately in Zurich.  On his last job he was a senior banker.  He would like to change to a slower pace type of job as this type of stressful pace is not good for him.  He is in the area of investments and would like to continue to be in this area of finance.  He thinks that the best way to slow down but still stay in finance here in Switerland would be to look for a job in a smaller family office or asset management house and get an 80% job as the big banks would be very stressful.  He is in no rush and is waiting for the markets to pick up in terms of employment.   
Any ideas or comments on how to find a less stressful job that would give more work life balance would be very much appreciated.  Also any ideas of family offices or smaller asset management ourfits would be appreciated.  He is looking in Geneva area, Lausanne, Swiss riviera on the lake.

I was wondering if anyone could advice me what compensation one should expect working as a statistician (fresh graduate) or one who just enter a field that requires a statistics degree/knowledge in Switzerland (fresh graduate)?    
also, what would be the salary like after 1-2 years work experience?    
from what i read, the job prospects are quite good for a person wanting to enter biostatistics field, probably in the pharma industry in Basel. in addition, people with statistics degree may end up in risk analysis/financial/industrial/insurance firms too, eg. in Zurich.   
nevertheless, i just want a ballpark of how their compensation is like in CHF.   
much thanks ahead on anyone who can contribute their insights.

Instead, let them very clearly know what you are doing for the company that goes above and beyond the norm, where you are a particular asset and why they should value having you as an employee. Show them where you are taking more responsibility outside of your designated function or make them aware of any successes or particularly good work you have done. Let them know all the great things about you, your work and what you are already offering.   
Do not make it about your ""needing"" a raise and do not let there be any hint of desperation. Make sure you are confident and believe what you tell them. Make the whole thing about your great service to your company and your wanting to be rewarded for that service. Be professional. If they say no, make sure to find out why and when in the future you could again expect to be considered for a raise.

In my opinion things are tough in Switzerland in terms of finding work. if you do not know German, then you have to be very lucky.   
Im not sure what rights you have if your wife has a visa, you might be entitled to an L permit but there are others on the forum who can advise you better than I. It might be worth contacting your local Swiss Consulate for exact information.   
Im not sure what Austria is like at the moment but Germany is really bad.   
It seems the job market should improve over the next 12 months but it might be a slow process until the swiss banks get their books in order.   
You mentioned you have health system experience, perhaps take a look at some of the Swiss software development offices, maybe the pharmaceuticals might be an avenue worth pursuing, Basel is full of them.

Under the new cantonal health law that came into effect on 1.7.2008, homeopathy became a big unsupervised free for all in Zurich:       
Should the federal diploma for homeopaths come into existence, Zurich will protect this title, and that's about it. I assume titles and certifications like EMR become more important once homeopathy makes it to mandatory health insurance.   
On the registration form ( ), there's some information about acknowledgeing education from abroad on p. 7-8. EMR has a whole lot of information about requirements on its website in German and French.

			Do you go down this route in the end?     
We are employing a nanny at present and our insurance broker seems to be happy to do all of the legwork/paperwork (free of charge). It may be because he is a friendly guy but I am assuming its because he is picking up the premiums too.     
On that note what do people think about sick pay insurance.  The broker is suggesting its a no-brainer because the employer has a responsibility to continue paying if the nanny goes sick - but I guess the devil is in the detail (and price).  ie do you have to pay sick pay indefinately or for a maximum period? Does sick pay only kick in after x days and with a doctors note?  How much does the insurance cover when you are paying the nanny by the hour and with flexible hours per month (although realistically with a minimum 50-60 p/m)?   
Anyone with experience of this?

			On September I will start my job seeking in Basel. There will be an agency helping me, but my position is atypical, as they told me, so I will have to give them some suggestions myself.  
In Italy I've been working with publishing houses for more than ten years. I write, do editing and take care of the quality of the final ""product"" (being it an article for a magazine or a book to be published). My main fields are literature (I've published fiction books for major publishing houses) and art (I still write articles for Italian magazines).  
I know I'll never do this here in Basel, due to language problems (my German is still awful). But I don't mind changing, starting a new carrier.  
What I will always love, though, are books and art. For instance, I would like to help a library to scan and digitalize its archives. (I love manuscripts, illuminated books). Or maybe take charge of the Italian translations of guides and captions in some museum of art. I also like natural history, or botanical...  
My contacts (journalists) in Italy could be an interesting ""plus"" for a press office (still thinking about museums).  
Is there anybody who could give me any advice on how to start, where to start from?  
I am 37 years old, my curriculum is good (I left a wonderful job back in Italy to follow my husband here in Switzerland), I am a reliable and accurate person, enthusiastic and young.  
Thank you for your help, any suggestions will be precious.    
PS: my main need, in loooking for a job, is to find a stimulating environment, to get in touch with people with shared interests. I'd do it also for free...

I am new here. I am from Romania, Bucharest. I came with my little girl in vacation, on 2nd August in Flawil- St. Gallen, at a friend and I am still in holiday.  
But I should like to find a job and to settle in Switzerland. 
How can I find a job in Switzerland? 
Thank you in anticipation for all the answers.

4912	Employment	Non-EU Job Seeking in Switzerland - Thoughts/Experience	waldymar	6637	108	Italy	12.08.2009, 13:05	"    Yup. I would take someone with 2-3 years for an entry level position, or if they were incredible in an interview, I might consider them for something with a little responsibility.      Yeah, ok, you got me there. Not enough coffee yet.      Aside from the fact that the hiring manager didn't know about the special status of Romania within the EU, this is absolutely right, legal, and even mandatory. No big deal. Want to work in America? Same thing. Fact of the matter is, there are countries that are considered ""desirable"" by many people around the world, and those countries have every right to choose whether to accept people or not. Other countries have the same right but are likely to be less choosy because they have a smaller group of people wanting in - sort of like a company hiring someone for a job.   
Also, consider that very many people in this country speak English at a higher level than you; English-only companies are likely to be flooded with more experienced applicants these days.        Sounds like you've a bit of a chip on your shoulder there. I realize the job search can be frustrating, but if you let any of this attitude flow into your application letters or such, you'll really kill your chances. Take a deep breath, realize that the world doesn't always work the way you want, and... keep trying.

			Maybe you need to start a bit below because you moved from the US and maybe the local accounting rules are different in Switzerland?    
Keep I mind. I don't know about accounting only that I am still waiting for one of those four companies to pay the bills. What's the deal with those accounting offices and paying bills more then three months after they received it which against the contract they signed to pay within 30 days.

			I love the 13 months salary system. Seems to me that whatever money comes in each month is what you live to, and we're on PAYE for tax, so when Bumper December comes the spare goes straight into 3rd pillar pension and other savings without us feeling that we have to scrimp in order to save.   
And like others have said, it's just the annual salary divided by 13, with 2 lumps paid in December (in our case).

			I've heard a lot of good things about this ""groupement de frontaliers"" from other expats who speak French well enough to work with them.   
Personally I haven't had many problems with it but then I don't work in Switzerland...but my husband does...   
Although living in France has taught be a lot about patience.   
Something else to remember if you are getting married in France...   
It takes at least a month to do it...and it is kind of like the Carte de Sejour process...   
There is a list of papers that you must give them...   
Officially translated copies of everything...   
And sometimes a few documents that you need to go to the Embassy or Consulat to get...   
You can get this list by going to your mairie and asking for it...   
Then you can apply for your Carte de Sejour which could take a few months but the Récipisée usually (for me at least) arrives in less than a month...   
So by the time you get to France, apply to get married, get married, apply for your carte de sejour, and then get your Récipisée, your G permit may be good to go...   
Anyway, that was how it went for me (except for the G Permit which I don't need because I work in France)...   
And for anyone who is interested...   
The carte de sejour is renewable every year (so far for 4 years)...at some point it is supposed to be renewable every 10 years but not yet...   
The length of time it takes to become a 10 year permanent resident or citizen in France seems to be getting longer and longer...

So, quality of life.

If you can work things via this program, the question of visa/permit is a non issue for the first while. Once you are into the CH system (have CH experience, have proven to your employer that you are worth supporting etc.) it is much easier to move to a regular B permit even though you have a non-EU passport. It will be up to you to get the language skills up to speed and to add value in whatever you are doing. To my mind, a very reasonable chance. As they say, success is in your hands.

			If the official lanaguage of the company is English, and they use English ""for work"" then I dont think you need to sell your English skills as such...they'll just want to make sure that you are a native English speaker if you've told them you are (if they are hiring you for your English skills I mean).  Apart from that, make it clear that you intend to brush up on your German skills, because even if they say that they use English for work, but German in team meetings, I'm pretty certain (speaking from experience of an almost 100% native German speaking office) that they will use German in general conversation in the office (which is totally natural)...so if you're German isnt up to scratch you could end up feeling a bit isolated.

			As above and...   
Small company: 
- good experience being exposed to various elements of company's operation 
- you are more indispensable (at least it feels like) 
- longer working hours as you have to do the work for few people 
- opportunity of being more creative as the future of company vastly depends on your initiative and you are building block of small organization 
- more pride in your work as you feel you are running the show 
- less opportunity to change position and most likely you will stay where you are 
- they make sure you always deliver 
- there is one boss and he is always right so do not feel offended when you are patronized  
- you think you are on holidays try to switch off the cellphone    
Big company: 
- more benefits and they are likely to deliver what they promised 
- opportunities to rotate from one position into another and promotions 
- usually longer holidays and regulated working hours 
- you can bugger off on holidays whenever you want to as there will always be someone in the office  
- you most likely will do the same dull tasks for unlimited period of time 
- you must fight to get exposed (in positive way) or shine to be considered for promotion 
- if you stay too long there you will become too lazy to start your own business and most likely loose the drive

4954	Employment	How do you rebuild your career as a foreign woman in Switzerland?	Forward observer	2480	15	zeurich	27.06.2009, 02:16	" 
			
			Hi all,    
Just came across this thread which i found of interest.    
I am also a trailing spouse (actually a trailing girlfriend), having left a good job with great career prospects in the UK to move with my bf to Switzerland.    
After the initial excitement and burst of creative energy in trying to find work, i am slowly losing motivation.    
I recently visited my family in Australia, where i haven't lived in over 7 years (and where i couldn't wait to leave if i am honest), and i now find myself longing to go back where i know the language, the people and more importantly, where i can get a job!   
I am trying to stay positive and to keep looking for work here in Switzerland, but the lack of opportunities is starting to get me down. I then try to be creative and think of ways in which i can use my existing skills, but then find myself restricted by my limited French.    
I am starting to fear that i may never re-establish my career here in Switzerland, and if i do, it won't be for many years.    
Am i being overly negative? Anyone care to share their thoughts?   
Thanks in advance.

4958	Employment	Negotiating your salary package	InShan	3353	20	Thalwil	28.04.2009, 10:37	"    What travel are you referring to?   
Travelling you do for the company and on business, for example visiting clients, is normally covered by the employer (but it is worth checking).   
If you travel by train, plane or hired car, this is normally reimbursed based on the actual receipts you present.   
If you use your own car there is a formula that calculates the reimbursement based on distance covered.   
If you travel by company car, special arrangements normally apply but don't expect to get back more than your actual costs.   
Travelling from your home to the place of work is your own responsibility and the employer doesn't normally cover this, although many employers make some contribution towards a public transport abo. Many companies, especially in bigger cities, will also charge you for using company parking spaces. So the incentive is very much towards using public transport.

			I think it makes a really big difference if you are an EU or Non-EU applicant.  If you are Non-EU and the employer is prepared to consider your application, then by definition you must be rare, with skills, experience and qualifications not found in the EU....   
We came from Australia. We relocated halfway around the world, and were definitely in a position to discuss assistance with housing, relocation and temporary accommodation.   
Also, the salary details formed part of the contract. My general attitude would be that it's not necessary to ask about the salary at interview - my experience is that the salary is stipulated in the draft contract, which you should be sent/emailed and asked to sign and return if you accept the position. There is no way I would terminate my current employment without a written contract...too many people have things fall through somewhere along the line (even promises of a job that are not fulfilled)...

			Simply converting a UK salary at 'today's' exchange rate is nonsense. If you move a few months earlier, or a few months later, that could make a vast difference to your Swiss salary, your possible lifestyle and how happy you can be here.   
I agree with Richdoc. You need to look at it more in terms of 'Right, £50k puts me in the top X% of earners in the UK - what's the comparable salary level to maintain me in the top X% of earners in Switzerland?'   
As you discovered on your trip, the reason salaries here are higher is because the cost of living is higher (around 20% according to the global comparison stats I read last year when we moved over). And the tax is not as low as you'd imagine, by the time you've added on the equivalent of NI, mandatory pension contributions and paying the health insurance out of your take-home pay.   
A straight swap is not a stellar deal financially. But... it may be a great opportunity for both your future career and your life generally. You may never be offered such a chance again, and kick yourself for turning it down.   
Lots to think about.

I am trying to improve my current sitation.  It's not so much about fitting in- as colleagues , everyone here is great.  Its actually more the culture- if have been warned not to take lunch very often, or work less than 55-60 hours a week ( on top of my 3 hours a day commute)  and to date- I have not done anything that resembles the role I was hired to do.     
I take my career seriously and so I am thankfull for all the advice given.

			Thought I would update on what has happened since we have registered for unemployment since it has been quite the wild ride!   
So my husband registered end of March and deregistered his personal business from the handelsregisteramt by the middle of April.    
We were told there would be a stand down period before we could get any money which was normally 5 days deducted plus a certain amount of days for the time when he should have been looking for a job (from their standpoint because he was self employed and not in a company just prior to registering it is different than normal, so different conditions applied)   
He filled out all the forms and went to the meetings etc. and they decided to send him on a training course for 10 days about management positions etc...all going well it seemed...   
then they lost his info that he had sent in a couple times and misplaced information and then we were told that we would have to wait for any money longer than expected because he hadn't de-registered his company until the end of April they said!    
But that was just because the handelregisteramt didnt publish the new list of companies until the end of the month which made it look like he was still registered until then.    
So we sorted that all out and they told us they would have to have their lawyer look into the situation and decide whether or not we would get paid any money from the time he registered or from the end of April instead.  
So then we waited and he continued to look for jobs.... 
and waited... 
and waited...and then he got paid for 1 days worth of money sometime in the middle of June...   
and if it wasn't for the grace of God and good friends and family who lent us money to pay our mortgage and some really urgent bills and bought us food when they came to visit and random bits of money dripping in each week for small things that had been sold/reimbursed etc... we would not have survived because we didn't get any proper money from the unemployment office until the end of June!!   
There were weeks (and still are) when we literally don't have any money to go grocery shopping at all and the food is running out in the fridge and then bang - something cool will happen like we get a reimbursement for some medical expense from a long time ago or someone books in to stay in our holiday apartment and we can go and buy food again, but it is pretty much living on the edge. ;-) Rather exciting I might add but not, at the same time, if you know what i mean.   
My dad kept calling us during that time and saying we should go to a TV station and tell our story about the inefficiency of the system here - and how could they let a family with 2 kids go so long without anything etc... 
but I just laughed at the idea cause it was a bit extreme, but I had to agree that it is pretty crazy that we have had to wait so long and that they didn't care what happened to us - it has been a pretty crazy experience and even now that we are getting some money in each month (not enough to cover living expenses because of alll the debt now though) we are so backed up in debt now that it will take a LONG time to crawl out...not to mention the possibility of losing our house or being followed by poursuites or betreibung if we can't pay some of the many large bills we have piled up waiting to be paid from the last 3 months!    
Anyway that is my rant for now...seriously though it has been a pretty crazy experience of just being very helpless to do anything other than trust that things will work out somehow. And even the guy at the unemployment office my husband meets with each time said there were no jobs in the system for him...   
So a word of caution to anyone needing to go on unemployment...try and make sure you have some kind of savings or something as a backup in case they don't pay for ages and ages because otherwise you will have a very hard time.

Ireland in particular is in economic meltdown with the present situation likely to only turn in 2011 and unemployment set to go over 10% (if it is not already).    With little or no German and as a graduate, you'll find great difficulty getting anything here. Consider looking more in Ticino.    No, your better bet, especially coming from Italy (where btw?) is simply to try to organize your interviews on the same or consecutive days and coming up just for those - Milan is only about 5 hours to Zurich by train, after all.   
The recruitment process can be slow and so you could quickly find yourself only getting interviews as your time here has run out.    There are no restrictions on getting a virtual UK number via Skype, however there are with a Swiss number - you have to be a Swiss resident. Of course you could lie, but then you would be breaking Skype's T&C's and, possibly, Swiss law.   
What I did before moving here was buy a prepaid SIM; cost me 20 SFr and gave me a Swiss number. Nonetheless, even with a Swiss number, you will still not have a Swiss address, defeating the purpose of your plan.

			Just to add on dependent permit (Guess its an L) - it is not easy to convert to Work Permit.   
If you do find a job after the employer has assured the Govt here that they cannot find anybody else in Switzerland or EU of the same qualification - they will have to file all papers for you and in that case you will have to return to India and follow it up with the embassy at delhi. So it is a bit longish process. Not forgetting that you have to be fluent in Swiss German if in German speaking area or French in the french speaking area to apply for the job and as said by message as above the degree is not recognised here.

			Its a tricky one.   
Its difficult to get responses when you're still living in Canada... being here with a real address and phone number makes a huge difference.   
On the other hand, coming here and not working for maybe 3-6 months can be an expensive game, and risky.   
If I were you I'd use a kind of staggered approach.   
1. Start applying now.. see what responses you get. 
2. Failing this, have you got friends you can crash with here for a few months? Come over on the cheap... 
3. If you have enough cash to survive say 6 months, then by all means come over and give it a shot.

In your case it might be worth giving your old employer a call, because in cases where they did not have current details for a person, they sent a copy of the card to the last known employer.  Perhaps they still have it...   
Good luck with that,   
Jim.

			Here's what the Swiss Management Organisation says ( ):         
An unconditionally released employee may accept a new position before the notice period is over, if this new activity doesn't compete the old employer. There is however no entitlement to double earning. Income earned until the end of the employer/employee relationship is credited against (the old salary). The only exception is if the employer immediately pays out the whole notice period salary.

the negative is that time spent on B (L?) permit while on unemployment assistance does not contribute to your years to qualify for a C permit.

Just ask your employer if he is ready to pay or not the notice period. If he says yes, well, no problem, if he says no, then threaten to use a lawyer.    
It would appear that the employer is a person of certain means. He knows Swiss law and he has to pay, he also knows Swiss courts heavily favour employees in such cases, why take the hastle for a few thousand francs ?   
There is a very good chance he will pay up as per contract.

			My better half lost her job 30 days shy of 12-months employment in Switzerland. Unfortunately she was lackadaisical about getting the E301, so only realized with one month of her notice period to do that there was a silly waiting list for it (in Ireland).   
I would advise that you phone them up. The situation in Ireland (and I suspect the rest of the EU) is that there is now an overwhelming backlog of requests for E301's, and what we discovered is you need to impress upon them that   - this will prioritize your application, but depending upon where it's coming from you could still be waiting weeks or even months.   
After, getting prioritized, she finally got it after five weeks.   
If you don't push them you could be waiting a lot longer; I fortunately don't need a E301, and so it's in the un-prioritized pile - since January...

I like to spend some time in Mozambique 
The sunny sky is aqua blue 
And all  the couples dancing cheek to cheek 
It's very nice to stay a week or  two 
And fall in love just me and you.   
There's a lot of pretty girls in  Mozambique 
And plenty time for good romance 
And everybody likes to stop  and speak 
To give the special one you seek a chance 
Or maybe say hello  with just a glance.   
Lying next to her by the ocean  
Reaching out and  touching her hand 
Whispering your secret emotion 
Magic in a magical  land.   
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique 
To say goodbye to sand  and sea 
You turn around to take a final peek 
And you see why it's so  unique to be 
Among the lovely people living free 
Upon the beach of sunny  Mozambique

Accordingly a US-qualified attorney is not permitted to practice law in Switzerland. However, with ""practice"" I mean will not be permitted to appear before court as an attorney and not permitted to use the title attorney (Rechtsanwalt, Advokat, Avocat, Fürsprecher, etc).

5036	Employment	High School Student Wondering About Teaching in Switzerland...Help!	Autumn Trees	1874	2	Canada	15.06.2009, 03:39	" 
			
			Well... It's not quite that simple, especially not if you were planning on teaching in a public school.  Unlike in the U.S., you often hear people in Switzerland say that private school is where you go if you have trouble dealing with the demands of public school.   
First, though you may have citizenship, there is a language issue.  Do 
you speak German - or better yet, Swiss-German?  You'll find it tough if you don't,,,   
Second, the question about ""schooling here doesn't count in Switzerland"" depends a lot on what you mean.  A diploma is a diploma, so if you've got one, as long as the school you have it from is accredited, there is no reason it shouldn't count.  BUT: it may not count enough, just like the other way around.  I've known Swiss who studied for two years at a Swiss university, went to the U.S. - and then, because they at the time didn't have any grades/exams to show for their studying - couldn't get credit at an American university for the work they had done in Switzerland.   
Third, teachers here typically go to a 'Lehrerseminar,' a specialized teacher training college.  In the past, you could do this directly from high school 
(starting at 10th or 11th grade level); nowadays, there is increasing demand for teachers who have university educations.  And then each Kanton regulates its own education system, so having a teaching training diploma from Zug, say, may not mean you are certified to teach in Luzern. 
You need to check that out beforehand!   
Fourth, if your education/experience has been entirely in Canada, it's well worth spending a year in Switzerland on a Rotary first.  It may or may not live up to your expectations.

			I was in your shoes just some weeks ago.   
I was also an aupair (but with an UE passport), and I barely spoke french.  
I started looking for a job as a graphic designer, and I got one in Lausanne after about 3 weeks.    
I sent about 20 emails to different places, both listed on job related sites and places I found in google. I think the best places to work are never listed, as the good posts go very fast, before the company has to announce it.   
I went to 3 interviews in the same place with different people, and I manage to learn just enough french to make it trough It was actually harder to find a place to live, then to work.   
One might say Im lucky, but Im quite good too.   
hints: 
-make a great online portfolio (not pdf) 
-look in google with some related keywords, find the places where you could work get their email and send them your portfolio. 
-be really enthusiastic about what you do and your life. That seduces the employer.     
so dont give up, work hard, and search like there's no tomorrow.

This is my experience of working with people with similar backgrounds for the position you described. You absolutely need the German communication skills, though. Without that you are in a weak negotiating position. Subtract 1000 CHF from above figures if that is the case, assuming you have some industry-specific background. Especially in the current economic downturn.

5045	Employment	Switching from IT to front offices	barish	805	0	Zurich	09.06.2009, 13:16	" 
			
			Hi all.   
I've been working as project manager in IT in a swiss bank since two years. I am soon going to turn 28, and Im planning the next development era of my life which I am focusing it on doing an MBA and switching over to the front offices of swiss banks! Reason.. obvious. More money, better bonuses!   assuming that the markets will be better by the time I will have graduated.   
Almost every front office job either in invest. bank or private banking require some kind of an MBA degree or CFA etc. I already tried applying a few jobs and it all failed. My first question is to all of you there with experience, is MBA absolutely required for such positions?    
I believe you all say ""yes""..so the next topic would be, in which school in Switzerland?    
The problem is, I gotta do an executive or distance mba. I've identified SBS and PHW as potential schools with flexible MBA programs (either part time or distance). I cant afford IMD or HSG so they are out of question.   
The problem is, I will have to pay it myself (since its almost imposible to get MBA financing in IT job!). SBS and PHW have 30kCHF programs and SBS has a 19kCHF Distance MBA program.    
Should I not even bother going to these schools and still find a way to get in IMD and HSG with scholorship etc. or something? OR are these schools good enough for a good banking job?   
Anyone with a distance learning MBA experience? Its half the price almost of a part time MBA in classroom. Self study is the big challenge I know.. but any comments would be appreciated.   
Afterall, if an MBA in one of these schools wont get me the kind of job with a good salary, it is not worth trying!    
Thanks

5050	Employment	Thai girlfriend looking for work in Switzerland	bucklt	5342	14	Thailand	04.05.2009, 14:10	"    Hi Goldtop. Absolutely correct. Fluency in the local language is by far the most important requirement by Hospitality establishments.   
I, myself am a Swiss trained and qualified Hotelier, with International experience in America, Europe and Africa. My last position was as a General Manager of a beach resort off the Indian Ocean.   
It has been extremely tough to find a position. In fact, I am still searching. Without the language, chances are slim unless of course working in a Thai restaurant is what she wishes.   
If she is searching for a higher position, there is no way she will get it if she can't speak to her guests and colleagues. It is the people business.   
I have completed 3 months of an intensive German language course and am honestly, quite comfortable speaking it. But I am still short of fluency.   
Nevertheless, I was aware of this prior to coming to Zürich and am constantly pushing to learn the language.   
I look at the many restaurants that I dine at, the Hotels that I stay in and I smile ... my expertise could be so benefical to the establishements in terms of service, quality of food, decor, management and p&l but without the language, I don't think I will be given the opportunity.

Let people know so if for example the first language is Italian, it would be best to have an English mother tongue person who also speaks Italian look at the CV. That way they can see from the original CV what you are trying to say in English.

5054	Employment	English Writing and Jobs in CH	mommyofswiss	16831	10	USA	05.10.2008, 05:45	"     
Have a look at this Google search as a first step.       
A couple of quick differences:   
On a Swiss CV, you will put your nationality, your permit status (to work in Switzerland) your date of birth, marital status, number of children and normally a photo. This information would not put put on an American Resumé.   
While most American Resumés are one page, you can normally go to two pages in Switzerland without people getting too upset.   
Keep in mind that American paper is 8.5 x 11 inches and Swiss paper is A4 standard (a bit longer and not as wide). So, try not to send your CV from the USA as a Word document but rather as a PDF, which will print out without any problems. You can get a free PDF printer off the net.   
Hope this helps.

My wife and I are both photographers. We live in New York City. 
We're doing well here but want to experience living in Europe, for ourselves, as well as our two year old boy. My wife is Japanese and has her green card, I am a US and UK dual citizen.   
We do editorial, advertising, and property photography, etc..pretty much everything:       
Would there be any problems working for Swiss clients, I think we can get by speaking English, but what are the problems we might run into with paperwork and getting paid?   
There seem to be a lot of advertising agencies in Zurich. 
Does anyone know of agencies that represent photographers that might meet with us when we visit in July?

1. birth certificate 
2. a certificate letter that tell that am single (specifying not married before) and my address in honduras, and that i am honduran nationality.

well when we got the papers she send it to the main office that is encharge of approving but i had already to leave the country one week before we got the papers so my future husban and I went to the migration office showing a letter of the lady that is encharge in the civil status office  that said that our marriage is in process and the migration told us that thats not enough  
that we have to go to the gemainde an register me that i'm living in that canton we are living now.     
so we where lucky I must say   but we are a young couple and we don't have any experience so we are struggling a little bit.

does anyone know if this part (EL) is a Social Allowance as with the 
kind paid to Refugees under Asylum Benefits or is this paid from a

			750 a month???? ouch...   
You CAN find places in Lugano for 5-600chf per month rent - but after that plus the cost of your health insurance (at least 180p/m) then you will be surviving on fumes...   
'Student' work is quite easy to find, you just have to be willing to make the effort to ask around and befriend people whenever possible (in a non-stalker way!)....You can usually earn around 12-18chf per hour part-time - depending on the job, so you can earn enough weekly to get by. However the people above are correct and I would strongly suggest you have a contingency fund already in place, otherwise you may hate struggling by during all of that time and your perspective of Lugano will change very quickly!

If you are going with an agency, you do not need to contact the RAV as you are not unemployed, you just finished one job and started a new one.  I expect that you will have to update your permit details, but again the agency can help with that.

Like any insurer, they attempt to minimize claims. The RAV is not a benevolent organization. It is not their task to facilitate education and training.   
Considering that the RAV is an insurer and the counselors are government employees, then they are surprisingly friendly and flexible. That is my experience.   
And think of this. If the RAV becomes more generous, then all the employed would have to pay higher unemployment premiums. Anyone here want another 1% of gross salary taken away to fund unemployment benefits?

			I know that you can choose either 1. not pay US tax on the first ~85k or so of foreign income, or 2. pay full US tax but use Swiss tax as a credit towards US tax.     
Let's say your gross salary is 100K USD in Switzerland, do you get taxed at the corresponding 100K tax rate for the remainning 15K?  or is that 15K taxed at the tax rate of a 15K annual income?  Can anyone help on this?   
One other question, can someone tell me, roughly, what your take-home pay would be as a percentage of your income for a single person after Swiss, US tax and any other usual deductions?  Is it about 80%, 70%, 65%, 60% or less?  I know it varies slightly from canton to canton, but just general idea would be good.  Like in the US, I know 65%-70% would be a good estimate for take-home pay after all taxes, deductions, insurance, etc.

I don't think Gautsch was being rude, just pointing out your spelling and use of English appears a little hurried and making a joke out of it - after all, in your post you are talking about translating or teaching English for a living!     
Examples:   
""i"" in the first person is always used in uppercase ""I""   
""to worried "" in the context used should be spelt ""too worried""   
There are quite a few more and you don't come across as a native English speaker in the text.     
Don't be offended  , we all take shortcuts in our posts but it is the context in which your use of English is used that makes it funny.

			Based only in the information you are providing, 200-250K CHF per annum should be about the average (the bigger the company, probably the bigger the pay will be). Cost of living, as said many times here, depends on your habits, family size, etc. That amount of money would help you to survive, that's for sure. Sky is the limit when you talk about accomodation costs, but prices are comaparable to other large cities in Switzerland, but perhaps cheaper than Zurich and Geneva.

As for the notice period, while you have a right to the salary from that period, you just join the other creditors in the line.  At the front of the line are the tax and social security bodies who can persue the directors/shareholders for any debt.  Unfortunately you do not have that option.   
You may be able to make a case with the RAV but as you won't have paid the minimum insurance premiums it will be a hard fight. It is a crappy situation but I guess you need to be realistic.

			If no longer notice period is stated in the contract, you have to honor the standard period which is 2 months counting from the next month's end for persons who have been employed 2-9 years. The ex-employee also has the right to a reference.   
If she qualifies for unemployment insurance is not your responsibility but it sounds like she does. Permit renewal is another issue though.

I'm a Chemistry/Biochemistry PhD with a couple of years of experience at working 
in Food Industry and i have decided to take my chance and apply for work at 
Novartis (Basel). I have applied for six different positions and i have received 
negative response for two of them, but no response for the other four.    
I was hoping if someone could inform me about how long does it normally take  
for Novartis HR to respond and if no response equals negative response.    
Has the economical crysis slowed things down in Switzerland as far as  
recruitment is concerned? Or is it normal to wait a month or more for HR to  
respond? What really confuses me is that they make it clear in their website 
that they need scientists for their always expanding reaserch department.

			It depends what you are looking for. If you want to work as an English language interpreter, translator or editor, then you actually have to be a native English speaker.    
For jobs in other areas that are subject to geographic distribution requirements (generally jobs with prefix P on the official UN recruitment website), there is a requirement to actively seek to ensure representation from all or at least as many member states as possible. But this is a global requirement, not a requirement to hire nationals from all member states to work in Geneva. This would be an impossible task.    
There are also a lot of jobs that are not subject to this requirement at all: extrabudgetary, short-term and consultancy contracts. There are probably more people on these contracts in Geneva than on those where geographic distribution is taken into account when hiring.    
And if you look at the list of overrepresented countries globally, most English-speaking countries are not among them. The United States of America was at some point underrepresented (I am not sure whether that is still the case), so any application coming from a US national would have been taken very seriously.

for at least a year.  In order to receive unemployment, you have 
to show that you are looking for a job( with documentation).  If 
you tell them that you are looking for a job in the US, don't tell 
them.  I.e. you won't receive unemployment if you tell them you 
are looking for a job there.

If so there is a course with a certification for that which is wide accepted for entry into the HR business.       
This is a necessary certification to go on for the ""Berufsprüfung"" in HR Management. We as Lern-Center awewa are also listed with our preparation course on this internet site.   
But the test will be in German or France.   
I think Migros do offer a preparation course also for this. We at awewa do also offer a preparation course for it. We could also look that it is a combination for language course and preparation course. Means German with English support.

			Hi,   
Don't know if this helps at all but i am employed as a ""nanny"" (21 years old, plenty of child care experience but no official training)  As mentioned before it means that you can pay whatever is agreed between employer and nanny (though the commune do sometimes give guidance on levels on pay and may check up on someone you employ to see that they are not being overworked/mistreated etc - i know of this having been done)   
I originally applied for an au pair permit but law here states that you must be of a different nationality / speak a different native language to the family that you work for.  If you hire an au pair they can only work 30 hours per week, must be paid minimun 700 francs per month (living with you and having food for free) but must also have 3 hours(?) language lessons a week and lots of other factors too about the exact type of housework (if any) that they are permitted to do.  In all for me i benefit more from not being on an au pair permit (though i guess im lucky too with the family i work for)    
 I looked into au pairing and all the details a lot with my employers and got the impression that its easier to employ someone yourself as there are so many restrictions that have to be kept to otherwise. In personal opinion i would say that having someone who can come to the house or taking your little one to a garderie would be the better option. Just my own experience but hope that helps??

			Regan is right.   
I own a private school and employ teachers also on the basis per lessons. And I receive about 4-5 CV a month for language teacher even I have not out an advert for one.   
Then as a non-EU citizen without a valid working permit it is hard to get one even you find a school which likes to employ you. I tried several times to receive a working permit for language teachers. But our teachers never received one and the costs for international search for about 4 month in all EU countries to show that we would not find a person like the one we like to employ were to costly for us.

2/ Company (CS offers more than UBS at the moment for example) 
3/ Agency cut (this can vary wildly)   
Yes you need to deduct Employer and Employee AHV.   
You should also ask to pay the max into a Pension scheme.  Then this reduces your tax and other deductions.

there are not so many offers in the market right now ... and AFAIK all clients are pushing down the rates ... agencies also profit from this movements enlarging margins and blaming the end client for the lower rates ... it is really bad almost cannibal ... and the worst is there is no so many people around that you can ask and get help from.   
coming back to OP, a Java Engineer will be offered right now e.g. 760.-Sfr per day funny is to look at the Job ad because with all the experience they ask for it really beefs up for a PhD in Java but they want the best bang for the buck i.e. they don't look for Senior Java XXX anymore but only non Senior and then pay less.

An example exception here (gross salary <120kCHF) would be the fact that you have a HUGE estate (in financial terms) and/or own property in CH or abroad which would be the info YOU provide to them in the first place.

2. Come across as having no idea about my own value. 
3. Come across as lazy for not having done the research.

			Hi there...   
It sounds to me, judging by your self-proclaimed teaching experience and education, that you'd be a shoe-in for a job teaching English. I have no experience at all teaching children, but I can say that you might have a good chance getting a job teaching adults if you had a CELTA certification. Unfortunately, that takes a bit of time. Depending on your experience, you might be able to get a job somewhere despite not having a CELTA, but you'll have to keep looking as jobs in our business tend to cycle quite a bit.   
Another idea, since it sounds like you're hanging around the university, would be to advertise around there to edit theses from students preparing to finish their PhDs or Masters. I've been approached a couple of times for this kind of work, and it seems like nobody quite knows where to get help with this. I looked through a 250-page PhD thesis recently--just for spelling, punctuation, and general readability--and earned a few hundred franks. I'm not sure how steady this work would be, but it's an idea!   
PM me if you need any other suggestions, and good luck!

I hardly ever have to write anything in German, albeit we converse in German during our monthly team meetings or at the dining cantina table (if you wanna get a full undivided attention of your colleagues). Also Swiss people like conversing in English and consider it as an opportunity to improve their command of this language.

I have one month notice period at my current company  but when I figured out that I have one month of vacation  I told them that I signed a contract with another offer and that I would like to wrap up the current projects and after that take one month of vacation. I did not want to resign one day and literally leave the second day. It was much appreciated.      They told me that my move was unusual  I said, honestly, that I did it because I wanted to be excluded form sensitive info once I decided to leave the company.  that was also very much appreciated since we usually do major strategic decision and planning before the summer.     Conclusion: just be honest as much as you can and show some bad conscious and regret. That is what I would do anyway  people have feelings, another thing is if they will show them or not.

			1) Contact the person who pays your salary and ask.  
2) If you don't want the extension of your contract say that you prefer the current one. 
3) In case of unpaid you can activate the Workers Tribunal (I dont know the right english term. In french it's the ""Tribunal des prud'hommes"". It's easy to activate and free of charge.   
Best way is to wait a few days.

5187	Employment	any translators?	Christopher Lord	816	0	France	04.03.2009, 12:59	" 
			
			Hi. 
Are there any experienced translators making a living in Switzerland who can help me understand the working environment, maybe by phone? I'm living in France and am hoping to relocate to Switzerland, but I need to understand the realities as far as work, residence, tax and so on are concerned. I should perhaps explain (and this is a peculiarity of translating) that after looking into the working conditions in France I decided that they were too restrictive, and have been working for some years now only in third countries (Israel, Italy, Argentina... all on line of course), which simplifies the bureaucracy to a manageable level. But from looking on line it seems that translation in Switzerland might be organised a bit differently. Would someone be kind enough to give me some pointers? 
Thanks,

I was wondering about the SVEB too. I am an english teacher, TESOL cert, and was wondering if I'd need to get the SVEB before applying for jobs.  
I know that the 'flyingteachers' in Zurich do 2 day course to take teachers from CELTA to SVEB;it takes 20 hours and costs 510 CHF. But that's all the info they have on the website. 
You said that you job offer was conditional on getting this thing- do you know if it is a must for most jobs?

			Its worth going to your RAV just to get some information/brochures etc. If the alternative responsibilities are not in your field of expertise, then arguably you would be best off mutually terminating your employment.    
NOTE: You can go to the RAV as soon as you suspect you might be terminated/cease to be employed.    
I've done this and it gets the ball rolling right away, and you get access to all relevant info from the RAV as to your entitlements. You'll also be set an appointment to meet with your RAV consultant. Any questions on the RAV information could be answered by him/her.

The basic idea used by most people is to figure out how much pension they want to have on retirement, subtact about 22,000 for state pension and then figure out how much money needs to be invested at a rate of say 5 or 6 percent to earn that return, that then gives you the total savings you need to make during your working life, after that assume a rate of 1 to 2 percent return on savings and you can work out how much you need to save per year, per month and so on.

			Just pop down to your local RAV (unemployment office) and talk to them. I recently did this (though I was made redundant, not fired in the strict sense) and basically they will set you up in their system and record all the details. Then they'll send you information and put you in contact with a liaison officer.  
Check out this link and other information they refer you to    
By the way, I have noticed that non-native English speakers use the term ""fired"" rather loosely, and it may not mean getting the sack as us Aussies would say- but as you'll need to take your termination letter to the RAV, they'll have to decide from there. In short, if you were given the requisite amount of notice per your contract, then I wouldn't say you had been sacked/fired, but just ""terminated"" - a slightly better status if you wish to claim the unemployment benefits.     
Good luck.

			I have posted this info before, but am happy to inform newcomers again  :   
The Swiss authorities love to know whats going on and have no problem to share their knowledge. So there is a lot of research on salaries publicly available not based on ""what forum members would like to earn"", but on the actual taxed income. You can gat huge excel sheets from the Bundesamt for statistics, but I personally prefer the very entertaining klickable map (sorry, but in German...):     
my findings:  
- Women are treated way more unfair than I expected. 
- the regional differences by industry are huge (of course you cannot compare a city with the countryside as costs of living are so different, but Geneva and Zurich are for example comparable)   
Have fun, I clicked around half a day when i found it the first time... and happy negotiations

			Hi,   
Thanks a lot for your reply Blossom. 
Yes, I would like to work with another family.   
Like my boyfriend said before, all we want is to live together but we don't have to work together, unless you have something for him too. He's looking for something too, anything like me at the moment.   
With a job we can look for a house and hope everything will turn pretty good for us.   
Thank you!

			Hi Mike   
We moved over almost a year ago, and put our then 8 yr old into the local French-speaking school. He is very resilient and has integrated happily, but don't underestimate how tiring and confusing those early months will be for your 9 yr old.   
It was a real refuge for my son to be able to come home for 2 hours each day and actually SPEAK to people who understood him and recharge his batteries for the afternoon session.   
Helping your child with homework, spellings and sorting out all the letters, etc, from school is very wearing if you don't have the language skills yourself (I do at least have intermediate French, but it still takes up a lot of my time).    
If circumstances permit, your wife could consider not trying to work for the first 6-12 months. That way, you could get your older one firmly settled and find the best available childcare for your younger even allowing for waiting lists. It will also give your wife to meet some other parents, and to arrange to have other kids back to yours to play, which is SO useful for building friendships and language skills.   
I even find being 'known' by the local shopkeepers, etc, to be comforting in a new place - it will help the whole family feel more settled if you have familiar faces around.   
Good luck with the move.

I get conflicting advice in this respect. Someone tells me I am worth a lot less than I ask for, whilst another helps me get a job for double the amount the first person said I was worth. Then I find out that others in a similar postion are on significantly more. So I would say go for what you need to live on, plus 10-15% unless you are feeling greedy   "	35	 Feb 2007	2	['1', '1']	['3', '2']	0

			Hi All,   
Very briefly, some history - I work as a Windows Server Admin in Zurich and around the middle of last year my company announced that 75% of the workforce here would be made redundant at the end of December 2008. That also meant that our UNIX/Linux guy left too.   
We have support from another team elsewhere in the world but there is requirement that I take on some of the basic *nix support for europe. (and I hope later more than just the basics!  ).  In the current climate I see this as a good opportunity to pick up some new skills.   
My company has asked that I find a Rat Hat course in Switzerland so I can start assisting the support asap, I've done some searches on the internet and can't find any english speaking Red Hat courses in CH.    
Has anyone used any training centers in Swizerland which can train in English? (it doesn't need to be in Zurich) - Ideally not 1:1 as that may drive the cost too high. They would also be happy for me to train in other flavors, but as our servers are Red Hat, it makes sense to train in that.     
Thanks

			Ok, from what I understand of your story the part that doesn't add up (from the employers side) is the fact that you worked 1 month beyond the end of your short term contract. This could be perceived as a continuation (see point 2 below).   
Word of advice, you did NOT receive a written termination of your contract. This should be done via registered mail, it was not ergo contract was not terminated correctly.   
Point 2. according to the Swiss Law (Art 334 OR) a short term contract (befristetes Arbeitsverhältnis) ends without written termination at the date agreed in the contract (in your case after the first 3 months). HOWEVER Art 334 abs 2 OR states that should the working relationship continue ""still schweigend"" ie without a new contract or any other contract then your intial short term contract AUTOMATICALLY becomes an ""unbefristetes Arbeitsverhältnis"". Hence your employer would need to maintain the correct formalities outlined in your contract and partially by law   
Not seeing your contract makes it difficult for me to give you  more accurate advice... but it may be worthwhile to keep that in mind...

1. leave your vested benefits in a free standing account at the pension company's nominated bankers eg for Swiss life policies this is the Banco del Gottardo   
2. Move the vested benefits to your own bank where they will open a free standing 2nd pillar account   
3. Cash in the benefits where you are becoming self employed, purchasing a property or (if non-EU) leaving Switzerland for good.   
But without even the name of the form it's difficult to tell.   
Axa Winterthur Columna are also my current pension provider and they correspond and have all their documentation/forms in English, French, German and Italian. Choose one for correspondance/form filling/discussion.

5269	Employment	Working without a permit	Elly	810	0	Valais	13.12.2008, 03:38	   Hi all.    Im an EU national and worked in Switzerland for 4 months last summer for a UK company who despite saying everything would be legal failed to provide me with a work permit. I am now in dispute with said company over a couple of issues and am wondering whether a threat of reporting them for posting me there without a permit would be feasible? Or am I better keeping my mouth shut as I could potentially be in as much trouble as them? Thanks for any help.  	52	 Sep 2008	2	['0', '0']	['16', '14']	0
5270	Employment	Employer may go bust - what's my position?	Aeneas	1367	9	Winterthur, ZH	02.12.2008, 13:37	"    Entitlement 80% if you have dependent children. Otherwise 70%.  
The entitlement is calculated on the average of the last 12 months or the last 6 months, whichever is more beneficial to the applicant. Note however that the maximum insured amount is only CHF 9'000 per month. Hence, you get max 7'200 or 6'300 depending on family status. That is the gross amount entitlement. From it, the usual deductions for social-security, accident insurance, etc.   
I plagiarised this info from another post here; always worth doing a search!!

A few months ago when the dollar and the Swiss France were at parity, it might have been even higher. A few other things to be aware of: tax planning assistance because you will need to file in both countries; housing assistance both in finding and maybe help with rent and then schooling if there are children.

The most important question is what notice period is there in your boyfriend's contract? I assume that he was given notice in writing, a legal obligation, and what does it say in the letter? Generally the trial period is three months and after that notice should be at least one month in the first year. Unfortunately in times like these when companies are cutting back just because someone is doing their job doesn't mean they are safe (last in - first out), but that doesn't mean that companies can flout the law. Also, according to the law, if requested the company must explain in writing why someone has been terminated.   
If your boyfriend thinks that he has been hard done by then he should get himself down to the local unemployment office and they may be able to give him some asssistance or at least point him in the direction of someone who can.

My wife is looking at various options to work here in Gevneva (part or full-time), for now we do not speak the native language (french) so was wondering if there are any shcools/colleges which offers courses leading to employment (e.g. seceterial, accounting, office administration, etc).   
Also couple of other things:   
- My wife has a Permit ""B"" 
- Willing to learn french too.   
Would appreciate any thoughts / pointers.

If your fiancee is a non-EU citizen then it becomes more complicated. She will not be allowed to come and live with you until you are married. Also, whether she is living with you or not (i.e. before you are married ore afterwards), getting a job and work papers will also be more difficult. It is doable and I am not trying to frighten you off, just pointing out some of the issues that you will face.   
With your kind of background and experience I would imagine you should be in the upper half of the salary you mentioned with Alstom, but that is just an educated guess.

This is my first post to your forum and as many others am trying to make a move to Zurich. I know quite some german, was already studiing in Liechtenstein and worked in Zurich. I like the City and swiss system.  
Because i am planing to make my PHD in architecture at the ETH faculty i have to first choose a mentor. I have contacted many mentors, was also there talking to some administrative people on the ETH and they all say choose one. My main concern is - one thing is what a profesor does, i like many works from them - but completely another thing is how are they like. I want to know their atitude to students, principles of work,....that i will be able to know when i start and it might be too late. So i would need some suggestions or comments about them.   
How is Dietmar Eberle, how is Miroslav ik or suggest other who works on a field of strictly architecture - not landscaping,....   
Please help me find some more reason to decide.   
Best regards and thanks a lot

			Hi   
With normal contracts the working hours should be stated.   
But, for ""students"" and ""Apprentices"" there is a loop hole where the hours do not need to be stated (except for some collective agreements in many industries).   
I think there also are exceptions for home working and if you are provided accommodation.   
I will check my Swiss code of Obligations to confirm this.

			Apologies in advance for a question that is similar to several previous posts. I'm hoping to get an answer which is a bit more specific to our situation.   
My partner and I are at the stage of interviews, and hopefully a job offer will not be too far away. We are trying to get a feel of market levels for salary for these two profiles:   
a) investment analyst - 3 years experience as an investment analyst for a fund manager, plus 3 years investment consulting/fund manager research prior.   
b) actuary (qualified) - 10 years experience working mainly in pensions/investment.   
Neither of us has worked in Switzerland before and we only have basic German knowledge.   
Any feedback much appreciated - it's proving strangely difficult to get this information!

5322	Employment	Ski season employment	adz	1254	5	Biel	27.10.2008, 14:18	"    This is good advice. I did a ski season once, though got my job in July as a result of interviews etc (it was resort management). There's quite often jobs available if you are already in resort and make a good impression on the resort management. We had quite a few leave after 2 or 3 weeks of the start of the season and were quite happy to have locals who would fill the gaps.    
It's long hours and can be hard work, but the reward was that I boarded every day for 5 months. I was in Austria and speak German (and French), but there were lots of people who could only speak English. If you get a rep's job, then you'll learn human anatomy - I probably had every single bone in the human body broken by one of my clients at some point. In a group of 100, I would accompany a visit to the doctor usually every day. And I wasn't immune to the odd broken bone myself   not that it  . Good luck!

			Hello! 
Maybe you wanna have a stroll around the airport and check the nametags of the people that do ground services such as handling...sometimes airlines get staff from a ground services company to help them do their checkin and so on.   
In Spain for example they have newco   and i had a friend work for them...she was assigned to do the checkin for many different airlines who don't have staff in Spain or who are short of staff...and her nametag had, beside her name, the name of the handling company Newco...so it's quite easy to spot.    
I agree about family...!!! my fiance followed me here for my work after i followed him for a couple of years somewhere else...it's so we are both happy    
Good luck with everything!

			Hello all,   
I would like to ask the typical salary of an engineering graduate with a master of science (Diplom Ingenieur).  
I am 25 years old and recently finsihed MS in biomedical engineering from Aachen, Germany and got an interview call in a medical device firm in Zurich. I have worked for 1 year as a Praktikant in a company in the same field in Germany but I guess student work is not considered professional expierence.  
The company in which I have interview is not a big firm. Its a spin-off from ETH in Zurich.  
I also know intermediate level of german language. 
Here in Germany the average salary of a fresh masters graduate without any experience is 40000 - 45000 Euro per year. and this is kind of a standard, its the same for all branches of engineering.  
Is there also any such salary standard in Switzerland for engineering freshers? 
Any inputs will be highly appreciated. Thanks.

			Hello Everyone,   
My husband is relocating to Zürich in January 09, and I'm a little unsure/ scared if I will be able to find a job there with my qualifications. I currently work as an Instructional Designer in India and have about 5 years of work experience. (Basically I write corporate training content by interacting with subject matter experts, designers, engineers, and applying adult learning theories, etc.) I have worked for Convergys, Intel, and Wipro. I am fluent in English and use it as my medium of communication at the workplace. I do not know German currently.   
I have peeped at some of the CH job sites and did not find many encouraging postings. I would like to know if:   
1. Any of you work as instructional designers in Zurich? If yes, please do send me some pointers. 
2. Can I expect to find a job soon? I am asking this because I have seen that job markets typically slow down during the year end festive season and don't really pick up until March. Is this the same in Switzerland? 
3. How badly has the job market in Switzerland been hit by recent market developments? 
4. My husband has been offered a salary of around 130k CHF. Is this enough for two people to live in Zurich, in case I do not find a job right away? Looking at the other answers on this forum, 130k looks on the lower side    
Sorry if I jumbled up the generic/ academic questions with the specific/ practical ones. I'm just a little unsure at this moment   "	144	 May 2008	3	['2', '2']	['168', '38']	5

If you work 100% you won't even notice this because everything is divided back to days. But if you work percentage like 80% then you will notice it very quickly.    
I work 90% and also do the monthly ""Zeiterfassung"" for my department so I have the joy of turning those hours back into days for myself and the other people who don't work 100% in my office. Even though I only work 90% I still get 25 days holidays a year just like the 100% people. Just each one of my 25 days is only worth 7:36 instead of 8:24, and if you take days holidays here and there instead of full weeks all the time you have to go back to the hourly thing to work out exactly how much holidays you have left.   
You are right that you can't take an hours holiday, but you can take a half days holiday which amounts to 4:12 so it still comes down to hours weather you like it or not.

Fantastic language skills in the language of the canton you wish to teach in, and qualifications in the subject area as normal. I have heard it is quite a tough course, but the job is very well paid.   
Good luck either way. I do not know of any UK universities that do a distance learning PGCE. If you are doing this then be aware that the GTP route is not recognized as a qualification in most countries.

			I'm holding (B) Permit non EU married to Swiss since 3 years.   
I've been offered working on some projects (Documentation writing, Plans,..etc) which is not really a part time or full time, just one of projects (Payments per project accomplished), the employer suggested all Swiss regular charges & taxes (AVS, etc.) should be deducted.   
I really need advice on couple of issues:   
1- I'm wondering if i'm legal to do this as i read somewhere that freelance or self employment is not an option for permit (B) & is there any legal term that allow me to work on this?   
2- When i went to renew my permit (B), the office of population gave me M2 form & suggested that the employer fill in the Revenus section, but this isn't possible with one of job!!   
Appreciate any help on this.

			You could always try the pharmaceutical industry in Basel.  With your nursing background, you could work in Clinical Trials.  It is essentially admin, but a good place to start if you don't have the language skills.  The big Companies all work in English. Do a search for CTC - clinical trial coordinator (or maybe clinical trial administrator), and check out the job description to see if it suits.   
PM me if you need any more info.   
Cheers

			Thanks again for your comments.   
I believe to be quite well paid already in France (probably well above the median salary all things being equal) - sure you might consider it well paid as well in CH but it is just a matter of conversion and placing the proposal on a scale.   
I gave a try again at the   calculator online and I always find myself quite below the median salary at the end of the calculation (and input parameters do take into account age and number of years of experience, industry, etc.). Once more, I may be completely off the mark - and I therefore quite appreciate your reactions - but I would be curious to know how accurate this calculator is based on your own experiences.   
'Associate' is a junior role, not an assistant role (already has one !) : everything from project management to 'strategy' (note the quotes !).   
Thanks again for your thoughts !

			Unless you have some contacts, it's going to be difficult to find something over the internet. My advice would be to save up some money and just show up. Hang out in a town for a few days and see if you can find some under-the-table work. Without a work permit, it's going to be next to impossible to find a legit job in Switzerland at a ski resort. You should be able to keep under the radar of the authorities for a season though if you can score a ski bum job. Check out Austria and France as well. If you are persistent and a worthwhile employee, you'll find something. Good luck.

			I understand that, although not exclusively, most English-speaking jobs can be found in/around Zurich (main cities). I am based in Chur, so it's a bit far (£, sorry Fr  ) to travel daily.   
So, am interested in hearing from anyone who is a bit more ""remote"" from the city as to what advice in finding a job close to home where English is freely used/welcome/useful.   
I am up for any job (well almost) within decent travelling distance as I could improve my German more quickly, but my partner is reluctant for me to end up in a bar, cleaning, stacking shelves etc, however my lack of sufficient German is going to prove a problem for a while. I am relying on the old cliche *everyone* tells me, once you are there you will learn more quickly. Not sure it applies where SG will be spoken, but let's not complicate things.   
My experience is in senior administration so very general, and I hold qualifications in Complimentary Therapies, although have been advised by EURES they are not recognised here (of course!) I don't particularly want an office job (hence the will consider anything comment) but will want to earn a decent wage eventually, and I have to start somewhere.   
Am willing to do the legwork and have already started pounding the pavements, but any comments welcome. Been told by EURES networking is the key to job hunting in Suisse.   
ps - not forgotten about the Permit issue...! 
pps - Hope this request doesn't break any rules on postings here; am just frustrated after 5 months of job searching...   
Thanks in advance

			Seems to me that you are going to have to do a bit of ""new business"" yourself.   
One way is direct contact with HR departments of your top 10 companies that you wish to work for, ie get on the phone before pinging you CV over to them.   
Alternativley get the names of department heads and chase them up.   
Difficult I know, but considering the current state of the UK job market this may differentiate you from the other CV's banging about out. If they cant help always ask if they know who may be on the lookout. The grapevine can be a handy thing.   
This of course depends on the time available to you to make calls etc.   
Essentially become a recruitment consultant and sell yourself out there.   
Hope this helps and good luck.

			Hi Matthew 
I work and live in Schaffhausen so should be able to answer some of your questions. for a salary 85k every month you will probably get less than chf 5000 in hand(you pay more tax in SH than in zurich). However since the rent is quite cheap here, chf 1000 can give you a 3 room apartement close to the center.For transportation, you dont need a car, the bus connection is quite convenient, at the end Schaffhausen is a small town. CHF 52/month for a monthly bus ticket. There re a lot of english speaking companies here, you should have no big problem of finding a job here. Zurich is 38 mins by train, where there are more career opportunities.

			Unpaid leave is totally at the discretion of your management so I don't think anyone could comment on the likelihood of you getting it. I think it is extremely unlikely that a company would commit to granting it on a regular basis at the beginning of a contract. 
As a manager, I have to say I would not view a request for regular unpaid leave during the hiring process very favourably!

			It varies - I know some people who essentially live in the UK and only come to Switzerland to work - fly in on a Sunday night/Monday morning and fly out on Friday night every week. Most (I haven't heard of one that doesn't) pharma companies offer flexi time so you can work pretty much what hours you want and taking long weekends with saved time seems to be quite common.    
I don't know of anyone who has got regular return travel included with their package other than normal relocation and an orientation/flat hunting weekend in advance so at entry level I would forget it - though within Europe as budget flights are so cheap to many desinations would it be worth it?

Now there is a temporary job opportunity in another team of the same company.

			I definately agree with Dave on that point. I'd rather be overdressed than underdressed for an interview. And I always go in my best outfit, shoes and accesories included. I've heard stories (from my previous bosses) of people showing up in jeans for job interviews thinking that it's perfectly okay. Urm, it isn't. =.=    
The attire helps sell an image, and you ultimately. Who wants someone with crappy packaging when they can get one that looks better? The biggest compliment I ever got was that when I went for a freelance business meeting; the guy I met later told his friend that he was pleasantly shocked & amazed that I bothered to dress up (smart-casual and all) when he just showed up in jeans, sandals and a t-shirt. To him, it meant that I was serious and willing to make an effort.   
As for the rest, well, I'm pretty used to multiple interviews - in M'sia and especially the teaching industry, it's normal to go for two rounds if not more. Work certificates, however, are not the norm.   "	111	 Aug 2008	3	['0', '0']	['20', '10']	1

Your American license liberates you from the Swiss driving exam, but you will have to absolve a control drive. The cantonal road traffic departments are listed  , canton Zurich's guideline in German  . We also discuss conversions in the Driving/Transportation forum.

			Hi,   
Some companies automatically deduct a percentage of your gross salary to put into the their pension funds. I know the company that I will work for is deducting 8%. In your post, you state that you are planning to save 1300 CHF from your 4000 CHF net salary. I believe this is roughly .325 or let's say 33%. If your company is making a automatic pension deduction of lets say 4-8% per month, then you can either subtract the 4-8% per month from your 1300 CHF goal and save the money for emergencies and travel or you can stick to your original budget and have 4-8% extra savings.    
In any case with a pension fund plan similar to mine you will have a monthly savings of 33% + (4-8%).   
Of course these are general figures you will need to speak to your company to get exact numbers.

I am considering a move to Geneva though a lot will depend on my wifes employment situation.   
She is a Programme/Project Manager (IT) Contractor here in the UK and we need to know what the situation would be for similar positions in Geneva?   
She has a PRINCE qualification and the going rate in London is £500-£700 per day on typically 6 month contracts.   
Sadly she doesnt have a working knowledge of French and so any position would have to be English speaking.   
We are both UK nationals so work permits should not be an issue.   
Can anybody give general advise on what employment prospects are like for such a position in Geneva or point me to recruitmemt agencies/consultants or head hunters who would be able to help.   
All advice much appreciated.

5465	Employment	American Dentist	Lailaluv22	2634	4	US	11.09.2007, 02:20	" 
			
			Hi their....Did you have any luck with finding work in Switzerland....I ask because im about to grad from a dent school in NZ, and am looking to move to Switzerland. Like you, my degree is not EU based, so I would have to get my degree recognised....Did you manage this??? or did you have to do further study? Also, are you correct in saying we cant own our practice, and that we must practice in someone elses clinic?? 
Regards,  
Dan

			Part-time work in general is relatively common in Switzerland, but it's usually a problem finding an   part-time job. My assistant works 30% = one half-day, one full day per week. Her little girl is 4 and starting kindergarten this August, so we've adjusted her workplan to suit the kindergarten time schedule.

			If they are asking for ANY documentation, this is in my experience a good sign and may mean that they are highly likely to hire you and so may like to get certain administrative processes rolling.   
In all the jobs I've had or applied for, I've never had to produce originals of any documents until after they'd decided to hire me and other questions such as when do we start and renumeration had been sorted out. In some jobs I had already signed the contract and the HR people said, almost as an afterthought, please bring along the originals of this or that diploma or document on your first work day. I find that on the whole Swiss HR people are extremely trusting in this (and other) respects.   
However, I have never been asked to produce a payslip. In most interviews, I have at some point be asked about my present salary, but I was never asked to produce any evidence of this. Quite possibly the salary may be an indicator of your level of responsibility and the trust the company places in you. Titles and such are not always indicative as some companies (especially non-Swiss ones) are rather generous in giving junior people senior-sounding titles. I work for ABB and on the floor above me every second punter is a vice president and there is a running joke that even the cleaning lady and the security jobsworth is a VP. If there were any truth to this rumur, obviously other companies would be careful not to accidentaly hire such people into senior management.

			This just came to me via a friend and I posted it on the Expats-in-Zurich site...   
We are a 1-child (hopefully soon 2-child) Swiss-Danish family moving to 
Zurich in June, with two full-time working parents with unpredictable 
working hours and occasional business-traveling. We are therefore in 
need of a full-time warm and flexible nanny/housekeeper, either live-in 
during the week or live-out, to look after our sweet and fun son (born 
July '05) and take responsibility for the running of the household 
(cleaning, washing, a bit of ironing and sometimes cooking). Work hours 
generally from about 07:45 to about 18:30 Mon to Fri, sometimes more  
and sometimes less, and sometimes (rarely) a few hours on the weekends. 
 We might arrange for additional crèche (Krippe) or play group for our   
son a few hours a day. If you love kids, are reliable and responsible, and speak sufficient German (or alternatively, very good English or French), 
please get in touch. Starting date June, July or early August 2007,  
with a preference for July 1st.

			Find out from the above links where you can get an initial legal consideration of your position. It maybe a good idea to have legal insurance, as this may drag on a bit. It's not likely that your issue will be dealt with in 15 minutes; be prepared to pay CHF60 or so for a 'first hour' consultation, which will allow your advisor more time to consider the angles.   
One very effective approach to inflict damage - if that's your want - is to approach the Tax authorities and declare your income, even if you're taxed at source. Go in the light of transparency and say you just want to be sure you don't owe any more tax based on the earnings your ex-employer obviously didn't register. Bring along copies all the documents you have given to the lawyer.   
They'll look into it if they feel there's been fraud, and you'll have a positive relationship with the Tax department, which is no bad thing. It would make your ex-employers life a little less comfortable, the idiot.   
The arbeitsgericht are hopeless for complex issues. My advice is get yourself a basic consultation with the big boys and follow their advice.   
What goes around, comes around.

Sharepoint is one of those technologies I've been training in. Really is quite interesting what you can do with it. I really like the self service permissions on sites. Saves a lot of messing around with security groups in AD users and computers.

			Hi Zorb,   
Actually I moved to Zug, not to Lausanne...   
Anyways, here the primary language is German, so almost all the job offers I run into ask for fluidity in this language. I am applying anyway saying that I am working in my German and that I speak fluent Spanish and English but it seems that that is not enough since I haven't heard back from them. It is difficult to say if that is holding me back or if the reason is that I don't match with the profile they are looking for.   
I would suggest you to take some French classes (find out if that is the primary language there, I think it is) so you may be better prepared to look for a job.   
I am still unemployed... I started learning German intensively to see if maybe next year I can apply to some of the Job offers that ask for middle German.   
Good luck!

 I've worked with a few agencies here and can say Swisslinx is hands down one of the few agencies that I have found to be absolutely beyond reproach on any front.  
I've found them to be very professional, responsive, and straight talking. I've met and worked with several of their agents and they are all of the same high caliber. And to boot they are massively connected and have good relationships with all the major players here.  
Big thumbs up.      elieve in your worth , and dont be afraid to negotiate. 
As someone advised earlier on in this thread ask around to get a sense of prevailing rates and 'tolerable' percentage cuts.(if there is such a thing as a tolerable cut

			Well it's been a while since I updated this thread.    
Current situation.    
I applied for three different positions at Nestle back in Jan/Feb and March of this year.    
One job disappeared completely with no explanation 
One I guess my CV got lost in the pile 
The third was applied for on the Nestle site. This one I was interviewed for. First on the phone, then in person by the hiring manager and second separate interview with HR / senior IT manager.    
Ok I didn't get the job, due to their quote not mine, not having the technical skills they wanted for the specific position. However in the interview with the hiring manager we discussed technical skills not on the job description.    
So now there are two new positions I have applied for. At least I'm told there are at least two positions or even more. Both are in the Windows client deployment , Systems management areas. I have several years experience in this area. I'm looking for some insider advice / support with my applications.  As these days it's a lot of who you know and not what you know.    
Any advice extremely appreciated.

I think as long as there's lots of demand, I should be okay, because even here in the Seattle area, part-time jobs are never advertised.

Hopefully it will work in Switzerland as well.

I'm thinking of working as an au pair in the French speaking part of Switzerland to improve my French. I hold duel citizenship between Canada and Switzerland and English is my mother tongue. I would be here working as an au pair as a ""Swiss"" so I don't need to worry about an au pair permit. Are the rules for employing a Swiss au pair the same as employing a foreigner? (ie. the language classes, wages, duration of employment?) I've been on the liliput.ch website but have been struggling trying to understand the German. If anyone has any information or advice I would greatly appreciate it.

			Question,   
Been working for a decade in Switzerland. Unfortunately now find myself redundant.   
Considering self employment, but when does it make most sense to take this route from an unemployment benefit point of view.   
How long after I stop working do I have to sign-on, and does the 400 days I have on unemployment start from when my last job finished or when I sign up. (I assume the latter).   
I ask cause it would seem to make more sense not to sign-up, but to try and work for oneself asap, and not sign-on to claim benefits/get distracted job hunting/language courses etc etc.   
Anybody any views on this?

			If you're so close to their offices, I would DEFINITELY drop by.   
Drop by reception, look at the office directory. Find out the name of the engineering manager at the Swiss google office (come to think of it, you can do this via internet sleuthing if you prefer). Send him your resume directly (addressed to him by full name).   
If google really is looking for smart, resourceful people, doing this shows your resourcefulness and ability to think outside the box. A good hiring manager would be impressed.   
If they still don't want you, well, maybe it is a company that only really needs code monkeys and people who follow the rules to the letter even though they claim to want ""smart, resourceful"" people.    
And either way, even if it doesn't work (going to the office), it is not like you had anything to lose anyway. You already applied the conventional way and fell through the cracks, this way can only get you noticed, and you won't be in a worse off position (not working for google) than you already are (not working for google) if you don't show up.   
What I still don't quite understand is this whole google mystique, and why people want to work there. Boggles the mind. (shrug).

			I can certainly understand that concern. The question is: how long is a few months?   
Whilst I wouldn't necessarily approach it as a salary adjustment, you would be fully entitled to ask the following questions:   
1) Who is paying for accommodation and what kind of accomodation? 
2) If it's in a hotel, who will pay for laundry and meals? 
3) Would you get a per diem to make up the difference in cost of living and to compensate you for the local expenses which would be higher than at your future home base?   
If they start squawking then you could be in trouble. On the other hand, it could be that they put something decent together for you. This could be a first acid test....   
My 2c anyway. Good luck!

			Au-pair or nanny.  It is all depended on you and your life style.  We have a nanny, she takes care of our little boy from after school until we get home from work.  We have our privacy and she does her job.  Our friend has an live-in nanny/aupair. Since she lives in the house, you kind of have to take care of her needs as well, food, well being, interaction, weekend outing, vacation, etc. It comes very difficult if you have a small place and if you don't really ""click"".  You should make your decision and start looking for one now.  I live in Lausanne and there are many medium to find a nanny.  We just got a new one 2 weeks ago as our old one sort of ""took off"" on us.

I had my CV translated into German and knocked on doors , not to many people I met doing this spoke English , but that was okay as my German is not to flash. Got this job through someone I had met that knew I was looking for work. Took that family out to a nice restaurant with some of my first pay. 
At the time I had been here just over 4 months . 
When my boss is away I am the supervisor,how we get by without me speaking the lingo I,ve got no idea,but it works stress-free(it has to,NO-ONE pays me enough to do stress)

I spent a couple of months in Spain studying the spanish language in a international school and I am currently working for a private security company in Ticino but the work conditions aren't good at all. I am not complaining about it, I get payed 1500-2000 a month and for me, being a student and all, it's enough.
But I'd like to find a new job, in my area of studies. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.

That segregation misses a key variable which is domicile; a non-resident non-EU applicant isn't subject to the same requirements as a resident non-EU applicant.   
Since the segregation is wrong (well ok, not wrong, incomplete), you might as well pick the option that fits facts the closest i.e. non-EU with valid permit.

			This is increasingly normal in Europe. Alot of people I used to work with now spend two weeks in Spain and two weeks in their office in London. They call everything in.    
I might meet each client once a year.    
This works very well in Europe but is impossible in Australia. I was living all over for the last couple of years (Spain, Germany, CH, US) and never had a problem. Then I moved to Perth and it took Telstra 6 weeks to hook up my internet. I almost lost my entire work because of that.    
So yes, it does work. But its very easy to fail if you are at the mercy of poor infrastructure. You cant keep explaining to clients that ""Telstra said they were coming yesterday"", because after 6 weeks they think your an asshole. I ended up having to stay at the Duxton 4 nights a week, depsite renting a great house in Mullaloo.....

One of the major differences is on medical benefits, which may be paid or mostly paid in the US, while not paid here. So you have to pay for it yourself.    
The pension benefits are usually better in swiss, when you leave out of the EU, you can cash them out.  
Also, beware that you are subject to exchange risk if you have Us dollar based salary   
my personal opinion is if you aren't getting housing or payment children's education, then you are better off on a local package assuming you plan to stay at least 3 years. If I could do it all over again....

			I've come across similar provisions to cover the salary otherwise paid out during the holidays.    
For example an employee working by the hour still is entitled to his 4-5 weeks of paid holidays. However, it is easier for all the parties involved if the employee gets a supplement amount on his usual hourly rate to also cover the paid holidays. This works ok for holidays, since the amount of holidays per year is known in advance, and if you know the approx. hours somebody works you can work out what the supplement amount should be to cover the holidays.   
I haven't seen a similar arrangement for sick leave. I guess it could be similar to calculate since paid sick leave is also limited to a certain amount of months depending on how long you have been employed.    
One risk I see is that the company is essentially offering you a total salary (albeit split into two parts: the normal salary and the paid ) and then attempts to waive its own payment obligations in case you are sick. To a degree they shift some of the risk of you becoming ill back to you, which was probably not the intent of the lawmakers.    
In the end you have to figure out whether it is a more advantageous situation for you to have an additional amount paid out upfront each month or have the assurance that if you do become ill that you will have sick leave paid by the employer at least until the insurance kicks in (often after 30 days)

In any case I don't understand you aversion to pensions!  The more you stuff away and the earlier you stuff it a way the sooner you can retire, like try 50!  Back when my friends and I were contracting in our 20s, we always maxed out our contributions and the result is that in the next few years we will all be retiring with an average around 50 - 55.  It sure beats working until you're in the 60s....

Your costs won't be as high as they are in London, and (outside of Bahnhoffstrasse) there is less of a ""my dick is bigger than yours"" atmosphere, so youre not compelled to waste money keeping up with the Jone's.

Thank you to everyone who has responded to my queries today.You have all been really great and offered good advice (except for one and you know who you are). I have spoken to my boys and after a deep discussion over roast port dinner thaey have agreed to give local schools a try. They did try to blackmail me by asking for a new PS3 plus games so we have come to a decision if they try a local school and after 6 months all is ok they can have a PS3.    
I hope when we arrive in Geneva that everyone is a friendly as all the peole who have replied to my thread, forgotton that there are nice people out there. That's what living and working in London has done you get use to the rudeness. No offence to anyone from the UK its a lovely country but maybe working in London has tarnished my impression of the UK.   
I shall keep you all posted as to which school and area I decide on. Will start making calls tomorrow.

I've been looking around the University of Geneva website and from what I can see there is no equivalent to a PGCE. Is there another institute that provides this sort of qualification?Has anyone ever taken the French test to study at the UG - how tough is it?   
I'm also investigating trying to do this online via the university of phoenix. Any pointers for other online courses. The Open University provides a PGCE course but for secondary teachers.

			So what do people prefer? The 12-month or 13-month salary system?    
I prefer the 12-month system because the 13-month system appears to be an enforced savings plan that doesn't yield any interest. Therefore, it is economically a bad deal. However, I can see that for some people the 13-month system could have behavioral / psychological benefits because it forces them to save for things like tax payments that they otherwise probably wouldn't do on their own.

If the (oral/written) agreement was that you receive a salary and an additional amount of money upon certain events taking place (i.e. startup receiving funding) then you probably have a claim. The problem will be proving it.    
If, however, the ""bonus"" was to be discretionary, i.e. your employer can decide freely whether or not to pay a bonus, then the employer is free in deciding whether to pay a bonus or not. As always there are exception, for example if an employer has regularly paid a bonus year after year and suddenly decides not to pay.

			Hi everyone,   
I'm planning to move to Zurich in June, where my boyfriend is working.   
I'm a Food Technologist (also an Agricultural engineer), with some months of experience in quality control, laboraty tasks, etc. I'm a native Spanish speaker, and have fluent English. No German at all right now    
I'd love to find a job in my field, but wouldn't mind to have a job anywhere else for the first months.   
Thanks to the main   of this subforum, I'm constantly checking some job-seeking webpages (job.search.ch, monster.ch, jobserve.com, jobsinzurich.com, topjobs.ch), but feel it's not gonna be too easy.   
After reading a bit about recruitment agencies (  and  , mainly), I'm considering getting in contact with one of them.   
I'm not familiar with this type of agencies, that's why I wanted your advice on this. Also, it seems they're focused on technology-related, and offer positions requiring more experience/qualifications than I have.   
Should I apply through them? Is it possible/advisable to join more than one?   
I've also read that there might be some interesting offers in the Commerce Chamber for Spanish speakers. Has anyone any further info on this?   
And also, am I (kinda) following the right path to try to get a job in Switzerland?   
Thank you a lot, really!     
PS. Hope my post isn't too long, or just too out-of-general-interest. I'm feeling this is quite a difficult thing to achieve, and getting somewhat desperate! Any pointers would be highly appreciated!!

			After having a threat of being made redundant I allowed myself to learn the law... When with a later employer I was made redundant I knew what I was entitled to and what not. It does make a difference and it is worth investing the CHF 20 or so in the relevant books. Of course if you cannot read German they do not help much.    
Another thing I never mentioned is actually taking out insurance, Rechtsschutzversicherung (yes Mark another one!!!) to protect you against legal costs. This is remarkably ""gunstig"" as you find out when you make your first appointment with a lawyer and find out what the fees are like.

Agree, especially with the big ones who are driven entirely by targets. Most companies have targets of some sort, but this shouldn't compromise quality. In my view the commission structure should provide the motivation and the managers should keep a check on quality.   
DaveA 
Agree that it's usually a mismatch between expectations and reality that cause negative experiences. Quite often recruitment consultants feel really awkward about saying they don't know. A mark of a good one is one who will happily say that this is somethingI have to go back to the client and clarify.   
Definitely agree with Peachy on rates though, add to that the fact that quite often the hiring manager who does the interview, if he's permanent, may well be getting less money in his pocket than the contractor, and this potentially gets everyone's nose out of joint. Confirm with the consultant before they interview that they are prepared to pay the rate you have agreed on. If there's any doubt or avoiding the question then get him to put in writing that they will pay you at least X amount per hour/day.     
On rates in general, it is two seperate commercial transactions. I agree that excessive margins get demoralising and usually aren't sustainable, but by the same token look at the rates consultancies or other professional services companies farm their permanent employees out to clients for. The mark ups quite often dwarf agencies! True that they provide some training and other permanent benefits, but they more than make up for it!

			All I'm saying is that everything that doesn't suit you isn't necessarily discrimination and giving some scenarios. In a small business, age may be less important than in a large institution where people try to use age as the pecking order, even when the management hierarchy doesn't reflect that. Specifiying what is wanted in a job ad is one thing, real and unjustified discrimination  is another.

1. Yes... no problems at all.   
2. Like said before, get a few quotes in-house, then go back to your future employer and ask for more. I moved from the Netherlands only 12m2 with packing and unpacking on both ends, price 7000 CHF. The company I work for did not chose the cheapest offer I found which was 5500 CHF, since they were uncomfortable with the service they offered.   
Try to find a local fairly large company to give you a quote. Also, as Crown Relocation is used by many companies in the Vaud area for relocations, give them a call, since they can give your a quote fast and possibly without a viewing of your items.   
Here are their details

Most common salary in the building was between Fr. 30 and Fr. 45 per hour for internal employees. 
If you have the credentials and wish to start your own company, Fr. 80 to Fr. 100 is an accepted charge-out rate, but it is only for service work which normally lies within word of mouth or huge advertising plans with lots of float to cover expenses. 
Otherwise, don't plan on making Fr.100/hr for 40 hours a week.

The rules and regs. are easy. But it takes a while for new people, even with experience, to come up to speed with a bank's global organisation, internal processes, systems, values and culture which are all critical to financial controlling, risk management and/or compliance. All these functions in a large organisation are all about working the internal system. It can take six months to figure out the jargon and who does what around the world let alone the rest of the stuff. A third move in 8 years won't hold you back but it will make some interviewers search your motives and they will want to be convinced you have commitment, particularly if, as you say, you are aiming at a more senior job. Provided you have plausible reasons for your move you will be okay provided you explain the progression to where you are now. You need to be careful in your next move. Four moves in 10 years won't look good in your field. Bear in mind when you read about job losses that means back and mid office not just front office. When places are being downsized every headcount matters and people will want to be assured you can pull your weight and have staying power.

			Hello, on the theme of Net income. I was wondering if anyone has any definitive knowledge when the Tax rules will be changed to make it more benficial (taxwise) to be married with children and a working partner, rather then ""separated"". I have hear rumours over the last 18 months that this was legally agreed, but not yet implemented. I think anyone who is in this situation is also waiting for this unfair situation to be rectified. This will be a welcome plus for my net income (hopefully)

If you have your own non-Swiss fellowship you are not an employee of the university.

			My company just relocated two of us (me and a direct report) from the US to Lugano.   
I asked about help with renting my house or selling it and was told that it was not part of the ex-pat package.  In both cases, the company looked at our assignments as being on a temporary basis and therefore did not offer to help us with selling or renting our home/apartment back home.  However, if we were to make this a permanent assignment, they would help out.   
I don't think it hurts to ask (I did), the worst they can say is no.  I had the same fear you did about being greedy, but got over it quickly the more I thought about what my family and I were about to embark on.   
Good luck!

I work as a Transport Planning consultant and am planning to move to Switzerland in a few years. I am trying to research opportunities in my field and I am hoping that there is someone on the forum that might be able to help.   
This is a very specialised field so I appreciate that it might not be possible.   
Transport Planners/Traffic Engineers are normally empolyed by consulting engineers and specialised transport consultancies. They are usually in high demand globally and therefore can work around the world quite easily. However, I would not assume that this is the case in all countries.    
Any assistance/advice/contacts would be grately appreciated!!!

			Hi Mario,   
As you might know a full time contract in Italy is normally 40 hours per week, in Switzerland 42.5 or something like that. Salaries are very very different, Italy has the lowest avarage salry paid in Europe. On the other hand, unless you are a 'quadro' (managing position) you have all your overtime paid more then the normal hours. Regarding the fiscal issue I cannot help you, my impression is that in Switzerland there are better conditions but I don't know in your case... if you are in Italy why don't you pop into a union trade like CGIL for a free consultation, they probably will be able to answer your questions.

5668	Employment	Acceptable resignation reasons for RAV office	zombiekiller	6521	13	Zürich	27.01.2008, 18:41	" 
			
			I did what you're thinking of doing, here's how it went down:   
1. Idiots at my previous employer (a big bank with a 3 letter acronym) were withholding information from me so I could not do my job properly and make a chance at promotion, lots of mobbing etc. involved as well.   
2. Made sure I got a favorable ""Zeugnis"" before handing in my resignation   
3. After incompetent management failed to fix the problem in 4 months time I handed in my resignation. (B permit holder till 2010, working for 2 years and 2 months)   
4. Registered at the RAV the day after I had my last working day   
5. Went in for a German assessment (weird, since I am fluent in German)   
6. Went to speak to my ""Berater"" regarding finding a job, he set me up with one interview (at a temp kinda agency which didn't help)   
7. Found a new job after 2 months   
What could I have done better?   
1. I could have started searching more intensively for work during my notice period (I was working full time, taking care of 3 kittens and a mommy-cat, and apartment searching during this time as well, so didn't have a lot of time)   
2. I could have registered at the RAV earlier (during my notice period)   
How was the RAV?   
I can only describe it as ""tough, but fair"". They demanded I apply for at least 7 jobs a month. In the field I am in there weren't enough jobs available in the Zürich region so this was mission impossible. After not applying for the minimum amount they suggested I look for work outside my area of expertise, and outside of Zürich, I refused this. Obviously the RAV only pay if you play by their rules, fair enough, luckily I had plenty of savings to live off of.   
In the end I found a (fantastic) job after only two months of searching. The RAV didn't really help me, but they would have helped (financially) if I had played by their rules. Luckily I was in a favorable financial situation so could afford to play by my own.   
ps. Yes, the RAV asked ""why?"" I left my job, but my answer wasn't satisfactory for them. I got the feeling that the Berater thought I was becoming a leech. I've heard that RAV experiences can vary tremendously based on the Berater you get. If you have a very good reason for leaving, and can back it up with proof, you might be eligible immediately for benefits, if not, you have to wait 3 months.

Do a course while you are waiting to improve your skills, decide what you want to do/improve in, hardware, software, area you want to specialise in telecoms/medical etc.. You will be worth more to an employer and attract better rates or salary.   
You could of course offer to work for free for your first month for prospective employers if they do not think you are good enough. I did this to get my first job in IT, not only did they pay me, I had a further 3 years of work.   
As mentioned before jobserve, also try the evening standard.

Hi my name is Claire and I am 27. I have recently moved to Lucerne from Australia and am looking for some nanny or tutoring work. 
I thoroughly enjoy working with children and have extensive experience with children between the ages of 4 to 16, as a nanny, private tutor and teacher.  I have taught environmental education, outdoor education and marine studies in schools, and have given private tuition in mathematics, English, geography, biology and environmental studies. I have also worked as a live-in boarding school mistress. 
I have completed a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Environmental Education. 
I do not have a car, however am willing to travel to areas around Lucerne.  
Please let me know if you would like my help as a nanny, tutor or teacher.  Thank you, Claire

5678	Employment	Working conditions/RAV calculation for unemployment pension/ quiting job	lucy_sg	3732	5	Zurich	17.01.2008, 15:34	" 
			
			There are 2 different agencies involved in unemployment benefits.   
1. The RAV. Their focus is on helping you obtain employment. This can include additional training, language courses, etc. The RAV officer verifies your job hunting efforts and gives you the unemployment claim form. This you fill in and submit monthly to the ALE-Kasse.   
2. The ALE-Kasse (Arbeitslossenkasse). They are the insurers. They compute the benefits and pay these monthly. There are several Kassen. You can choose almost any. One restriction is you must stay with the chosen Kasse, unless you shift domicile. Unia is big, competent and well organized. You can go there and get advice.   
If you quit your job, then the RAV officer can impose penalty of waiting up to 60 working days, till benefits are granted. The officer has the discretion to decide the latency (minimum is 5 days). You may be able to persuade the officer to shorten the wait by explaining the special circumstances.   
If you are heading for the described situation, then do the following. 
1. Begin applying for jobs immediately, i.e even before quitting. Meticulously document every single application. Submit at least 2 job applications weekly. Going to the first RAV interview with a thick dossier of applications would help reduce the waiting period. 
2. Also meticulously document the mobbing situation. Documentation must include copies of complaint letters and eMails, which you write to your supervisors and the HR department. This will lend credibility to your explanation why you quit.   
Like others have written in this Forum, the RAV officers are competent, helpful and friendly. Of course, they expect the job seekers to be genuine, cooperative and earnest. The RAV officers also know what working conditions prevail where and have their sources to formally and informally verify claims.   
Good luck!

Always approximately.

5.05% = AHV or first pillar contribution 
1% = Unemployment Insurance 
3.5% = 7% / 2 = second pillar contribution

Do you know where to study ACCA in Swiss?

			I would say have a look at this website ..    
This will allow you to choose the categories where you fit in .. and then allow you to decide on the salary which you would like to start with.   
If I were you, I would ask the upper 75% bracket, since you said, you have to  be more or less fluent in all the three languages  ... which is quite an asset.    
Once you go through the website, I think you will understand why the amount quoted by anyone in a website such as this might be off mark, since we are not aware of all the facts.   
Hope this helps ... Tschuss...

			I am a freelance Music composer/songwriter & recently had a commission to write & compose 3 pieces of music (including lyrics) for a company in Basel to promote their products.   
This company were explained 'the rules' but have not heeded any of the procedures required that involve this kind of commission, ie: they must stream the music from their website (not make songs available as download unless they pay), cannot release/promo CD's without a label code, must include royalties per sale/distribution for the Artist (a UK one who knows the rules), must credit the composer via all media, must not reproduce lyrics without composer consent... are just some of the rules they are flouting.   
The ironic thing is that they 'forgot' to remind me to sign an exclusive contract when they paid so the ball really is in my court.   
What I'm looking for is a good lawyer, not necessarily specialized but it would help.   
I am a member of SUISA (which should go without saying) so everything is well above board on my side.

The point being you cannot have a contract with the company unless you are a company. So you have an employment contract on fixed terms ie until 30th June and within this they must abide by Swiss law which is basically 1 month after the probation period. If you have a company and have created a contract between the two companies then it is an agreement between the parties as to how long the notice period is as the employment contract between the person and the company is separate to this. In this case you can have a one week notice period but this would not be normal.

			As you're likely to pay tax at source, what you want to do is look at the tax at source table for your canton which will give you your correct tax amount with minimum interpretation risk. Supposing you're single,  gives you a tax rate of 11.67% per month, or 1164 CHF a month. Since you are married,  gives you the corresponding rate of 8.27%, or 825 CHF a month.   
These figures valid for Kt. Zurich. Kt. Geneva, multiply by two and you're in the right ballpark

			Sounds like your friend is in a tough position. 
From my understanding, the details should be clear to when and where he cannot work for competition. Read, or have someone who knows the rules read, the document he signed and it should be clear to where he can work. More than likely out of Switzerland. 
I believe penalties can be placed but as long as certain ""clients"" are not carried away from the original organization, problems should be minimalized and he may be able to make an arrangement otherwise.  
Worst case, ensure the job title he takes does not carry the old title his is avoiding even if he works in a similar field. 
I know one case that such a person broke this contract and was taken out of the country so be careful if he does not have the proper permits or visas.  
Also, tell him if he feels bullied because of his race, he can certainly cause problems for the employer, legally he has rights, but know he may also end up in deeper than he can cope with if he is not familiar with the Swiss laws and can not fund a good lawyer. 
Good luck for him

			Hi all. Thought I'd just tag onto this already useful thread.    
I'm in a similar posish to nickj, well similarish. I'm a mere baby at 29 but I'm seriously considering getting out of academia (which is where I'm at now). I'm English, live in Germany at the mo and would like to come back to Switzerland (we lived in Zuerich for three years) and find a real job (no offence to other academics intended  ). Zuerich would be good, but I'd certainly consider elsewhere. January 2010 would be my ideal time to make the jump.   
Now I do have programming experience, I'm a theoretical/numerical astrophysicist and I program in Fortran (I know) and a bit of C. I have a UK PhD in theoretical astrophysics and three years experience as a postdoc. I'm doing a part time one year course in Java (German govt. approved if you don't mind, and auf Deutsch) which I'm getting quite a lot out of. I'm an experienced linux user, but I don't know a lot about admin, though I did do a short course last year. My German is fair to middling (B2/C1 level) and I get by in French. I have done a little SQL and php in the past but just for fun and it's very rusty.   
So, in addition to the great advice previously meted out, does anyone have any suggestions for my case? Where I might look? What I might do to prepare myself? Am I barking up the wrong tree entirely?    
Thanks is advance.

			Good day to all! I am new to the forum. I hope, I can get a few feedbacks from you. 
I would like to go back to work again after giving birth to my 3 year old daughter . I graduated as a nurse in the Philippines. When I came here in CH; I worked as an assistant nurse in a Pflegeheim, thinking that it could help me gain my self confidence by adjusting first with the language (german) and to the people as well and slowly learning the nursing sytem. It was quite late when I passed my paper to Red cross for the registration of my diplome, so that when I got the preliminary decision from them, I just got pregnant. Redcross wanted me to do a 6 months training (anpassungslehrgang). Unfortunately, I was not able to oblige to this, as I didn't go back to work after giving birth. 
I want to ask if you know any hospital/institution ( I reallly prefer to work in a hospital) who could maybe provide trainings for people like me, who, for a long time did not work in the hospital? There are actually many hospitals looking for nurses here, but they have to be experieced I hope there is still room for me.   
Thanks for feedbacks!

			I have no idea what the Swiss standard for a CV is. However, you do have the right to get a reference letter from your last employer and I read somewhere that you actually have the right to get a ""positive and uncoded"" one. Codes: I do not know if you do the same in the UK, but there are certain ways in the German speaking countries to express negative stuff in really positive terms. So it can sound very nice for you but actually means something negative every other HR guy will understand, like ""he was always on time"" meaning ""there is nothing positive about him except that he actually shows up at work on time""... so you should be very careful with the text you get.  
Definitely ask for it, if you have no other ""proof"" of six years work experience. And you already figured out how important any piece of written documentation is... 
And keep up the spirit. I do not remember how many applications I wrote but I am sure it was more than 200...   
Cheers,

			I would recommend, having done an internship myself, doing the work experience as you can always go back to your studies to finish them, and the employer might (!) even offer you a position if you agree to come back to them (assuming they were satisfied with your work).    
It comes down to giving up a little time of your 60+ year life (which is not so bad) and having the chance to get the edge over all the other graduates of your year. IT jobs are always in demand, I think a year later won't affect the market greatly, and in any case you have experience in the bag that most other students won't have.    
Good luck!

			Before you 'let the company pay'... will you have to pay tax on those relocation benefits?    
When we moved here  - years ago, mind - the relocation company assigned to us earned their fees as a percentage of costs - and so it was in their interest to push those expenses as high as possible. Knowing now what I didn't know then, I would say the cost of our relocation was   double what it should have been.    
If the costs seem outrageous, ask for a competing quote. Your new employer just might be impressed with your sense of fiscal responsibility.   
Fine and dandy if the company is willing to pay, but make sure you understand the how that generous relocation benefit will be treated at tax time.

			>>Would 125k CHF gross would be above or below average?   
I would say above average. I'm only going on officially gathered stats available on the web. Then again it depends on how much they want you and what it is you do. To get a better idea, post your current salary and how much you pay in rent. Then you can work out if you'd be ""better off"". BTW, like everywhere else, accomodation eats up a large chunk of salary so if they provide you with a flat you'll be saving quite a bit.   
>> I heard that 5-15k CHF is standard issue for a relocation package.   
Again, depends on how much they want you. But if they're giving you say three months rent free, that's worth 5k easily.

I think you should go for the 85/90 kCHF (but let them know that it is negitionable), but also ask about pension schemes, bonus, tax (should be less than in Spain) etc. As far as I know Holcim pays more towards the pension scheme than other companies - and this might make the difference.

			Hi Rami,   
I'm sure that you can do just fine on the salary offered, however I would have to say that I thing the company's offer is well below the going rate for someone in your situation.   
Given your degrees and experience I would have expected at least CHF100,000 and then some.   
Next up is the idea of the company getting a permit for your wife - this is simply BS!  If you get a permit, then you can expect that your wife will get a permit to come and live with you - but not to work.  This is standard, nothing to do with the company....   
I have no idea if your wife will be able to get a permit to work or not, but given that you are non-EU......   
Over all this is not a good offer and the whole story of the wife's permit would make me concerned about their behaviour.     
Good luck,

5784	Employment	Compassionate leave	Sandgrounder	4284	19	ZH	31.12.2007, 10:36	"    Firstly while courts should be, and usually are, unbiased, in the case of employment disputes they openly favour the employee based on the premise that the employer holds all the aces - which of course they normally do.   
With respect to this particular instance the court would find in favour of the employee for the following reasons:   
According to law there is no defined period of absence for exceptional circumstances such as death in the family.   
Each company is left responsible to set reasonable periods.    
In the absence of any defined period the court needs to consider the legal requirement of an employee to act in the interest of the employer with respect to absences and the length of time that can be considered reasonable.    
When there is a case of instant dismissal the court additionally needs to consider the gravity of the case and the reasonable expectation that an employee acting in such a way would receive a severe censure.    
Given that the company has failed in its duty to set the standard by which the employee should be measured and that the employee through the circumstances might well not be thinking rationally, there can be no reasonable expectation that the employee could expect a severe censure for the actions they took.   
Hence there can be no reasonable grounds for instant dismissal - a caution yes and a repeat event would be good grounds as long as action was taken in the first case. If no action was taken in the first case a precedent has been set by which the employee would consider being measured and hence the standpoint of the employer is weakened further.    
Now there is one other point to be considered, 10 days is the extreme limit of what can be considered reasonable. So the employee is really walking a fine line between censure and acceptance. However, if you are a judge considering this case then at what point would you say an instant dismissal is justified and under what circumstances. If we start with everyone agrees 1 day is reasonable, but hold on most companies have 2 and certain companies have 3 and possibly other companies give 4 days. At what point is the line crossed that justifies dismissal if this has not been defined for you?    
With respect to court rulings, Switzerland uses the principle of jurisprudence constante and not stare decisis. As such while hoping to remain consistent with previous decisions, each case is viewed independently on its merits and thus any prior court rulings would need to have the exact same situation to have much relevance and although I have not looked, it is rather unlikely that I would find one. An example is the earlier quoted time for seeking employment of half a day per week.

			Hi,   
Not sure which Buchs, If you go to EA Europe Jobs they have Switzerland, Buchs listed. I could not find any info on that office. I know that the one in Geneva is the European Corporate Office.   
Regarding the publisher in Austria I think you are referring to JoWood. Funny, they are actually the ones that bought a large share in the game publisher I worked for here in Canada. I certainly did not close that door, that is also an option. I like Austria too thought the West side with the mountains and lakes    
Cheers.

			Hello everyone,   
  My name is Mihaela and I came to Switzerland about two months ago. Since I am a very active person, not finding a job to burn my resources has almost gotten me to the point of becoming frustrated about life in this country.    
  Im fluent in English and French, with basic knowledge of German and Spanish.  I have a consistent background in administrative work, especially in the legal field and with NGOs. I have completed several volunteering stages in the United  States and worked as a Human Rights Director and Legal Secretary in Romania. I do have a B permit, as my husband already works here in Switzerland.    
  Currently, Im living in Birmenstorf AG, but the opportunity to work in the French part of Switzerland would be preferable in order to use both my French and English languages knowledge.    
  Please feel free to PM me for my resume or any extra information that you might be interested in and I will be more than happy to respond.   
My best wishes to all of you !

My very personal tips are: 
1.- Finish the PhD,  
2.- Improve French 
3.- Keep in mind that HR is very complex in CH; MR may be better 
4.- Try academia and gather some experience there 
5.- Try small companies and gather some experience there 
6.- Take your time and don't become desperate, as already stated CH processes are perceived as slow    
HR International company + No experience in CH + Unfinished PhD is not a good combination for CH   
Just my 5 Rappen

5795	Employment	second interview experiences	opel	1947	2	Basel	15.12.2007, 11:29	" 
			
			First of all well done on getting called for a second interview, they've obviously seen something they like.    
In my recent experience I found that the 1st interview consisted of subject matter experts giving me a good grilling on my knowledge. The second round of interviewing was much more focused on soft skills, so I met with HR and they asked a lot of personality type questions and then I got to meet with the people I will be working alongside. They were less concerned with what I know and more interested in whether I would be a good fit for their teams.  
I actually found the second interview far more enjoyable than the first, I was much more relaxed and it probably showed.   
Good luck

			Hi everybody, 
It's been a long time since my last post but until last week i didn't close everything. Too many things for the end of the year and mine was just one. 
At then end i closed the deal and i'm moving to basel  
Ok, the deal is a little bit better, 97500CHF, bonus at the end of the year depending on company profit and i will have the chance to get stock options from the mother company in USA. They will also pay me 50% of the rent the first 2 months or 100& the first month. I will start on Jan 7th.   
I'm very happy with this deal. It's not what i expected when i started with all this nearly 3 months ago but as i said several times, i'm moving basically for personal reason and not for professional reasons.   
I also managed to agree with my future boss a future meeting after 6 months to renegotiate my conditions. I think that it would be easier to ask for more salary once he sees how i work.   
Anyway, I'm really happy with my decission even though all my colleagues in my current company are calling me crazy for leaving a Regional Sales position. I'm still young to make these crazy things and i hope at the end everything will be worthy.   
I'm quite sure that from now on i will surf this forum very often so... hello again to everybody    
Cheers

Edit: The January thing makes me wonder if you are speaking of a convention collective / Gesamtarbeitsvertrag? If yes it probably means that the contract can be modified every January, after negotiations between your union and your employer, and you probably still have a shorter notice period than 12 months.

Carla.   
Heres the thing, I moved to Basel, from Belfast, 2months ago for a year long traineeship. I earn approximately 2100CHF after taxes. I have an extremely full social life after work and at the weekends it is completely hectic. I am perfectly able to afford going out for dinner at least twice a week. And no, I am not being supported by parents/boyfriend (in fact my boyfriend is Swiss, a student, and poorer than me!). As I tell people, it is cheaper for me to live here than it is for me to live at home. Believe it or not, my rent is cheaper, for a much bigger apartment and is inclusive of all utilities.    
If you want to, it is perfectly do-able, without a doubt. And yes, I have only just left university, no I do not have any savings by which I am subsidising things and no, I am not careful with money.   
And you know what? I'm having a ball.

It is exactly as you say, very tight headlines, very long hours, a suffocating hierarchical structure, stress at extreme level, very low rewards for good work, etc. etc. I might have been the unlucky one, though, who knows? Just one thing, don't form your opinion only on the voices of this forum. Most people who write here do have a positive experience and the ones who are disgruntled about Switzerland will not be warmly welcomed and will be seen as party-poopers and not treated with much fairness in my view.

			I would just like to warn anyone who gets offered a position at a company called PLC DataSystems in Nyon.   
I worked there for 2 weeks and was let go without any notice (I wasn't even told, they said I would work 'freelance').  This was over a month ago, and I have still not been paid by the company, despite contacting them on a number of occasions and being told that I would be paid on 10 October.   
I have also heard a number of dodgy things about the 'Director' of the company, who is actually bankrupt (more than once) and is not actually allowed to be director of any company, PLC DataSystems is in his wife's name, but he is acting director.  I also believe he has been kicked off the board of a number of companies.   
A friend of mine also had trouble with this company, although she was more sensible than me about getting paid but has also left the company.   
Please do not work for this company!

			Hi there!    
Seeing as it might take a while until i master (!) swiss german, I am looking for ways to get a bit of cash to keep me going.    
So I could give greek lessons (I'm a native speaker) to either children or adults, if you know anyone that might be interested? I live in Bern, but I wouldn't mind travelling a bit.    
My english is excellent and I understand high german and basic french (although I cannot really speak it). What I'm trying to say is that the lessons would have to be in english but I'd be able to communicate in other languages for the basics.    
Also, if anyone knows of any greek families that would like to have some kind of native greek babysitter, give me a shout! I'm a psychologist with a master in health psychology and I have worked with children in the past.    
Anyway if anyone or anyone you know is interested, please let me know. I appreciate your help!   
cheers,

			I'm after a bit of advice.   
After a few weeks of searching I found what seemed like an ideal job, Project Manager for an International Design Firm working of projects in the Middle East. 
I've been working 3.5 months and things aren't too good.  
I realised there were a few problems with the business plan and identifed a number of 'problems' with fees and explained we needed to take drastic action (they had no contingency plan!) and after re-working a few things we are back on track. Only problem is the MD stopped talking to me and my tasks have been shifted to other members of staff. 
I was working many extra hours and was asked to do 120% hours, which with 15 hours of travelling was taking me upto a 66 hour week, which I told them was unsustainable. They told me it was my problem. 
I had my review today and they are now asking me to define my role and tasks, thus to justify my job for another review in December. 
Addtionally, my team is expected to work until all hours to finish work (its been midnight and 2am for some of them) and weekends.   
My question is... is this normal for Swiss firms, can they fire me for not doing a job they won't define and lastly is it better to leave than be pushed.  
Also, I am living in germany and as such they haven't given me a Grenzeganger (Border worker) pass/ work permit - is this normal?

			Hi Tweener,   
I do not know a ting about your profession, but I do know about Dublin. Its a gem. Its also what you make of it. You can either spend all your cash on the nightlife and crawl the pubs till late, or you can get up with the rest of the professionals at 6 and head to work by 8. (okay, some of them get up at 7:45, or perhaps just crawled in...) Its a major European city, with fantastic prospects and networks for a young professional such as yourself. I would say the major difference between living in Dublin vs. living in Zurich as far as quality of living goes is the public transport. There is just no competition between the two. Zurich has it made, where Dublin is really far behind. But Dublin is not too big, so you can get around fairly easily. Crime is a little more rough in Dublin, but that has everything to do with where you hang out at night, and with whom.  If you just use common sense, you will be fine there.     
I think as a young Italian man, you have nothing to lose by being adventureous. If you were older, perhaps you might think more about ""safer"" issues such as travelling far from home for the first time. But the Irish people are very warm and friendly, you would have no problem meeting loads of friendly, open friends in no time.  you are young and obviously quite bright, so you have the world at your fingertips! You are only 2.5 hours away from home by plane from Dublin.  Personally, there's something to be said for the craic in Dublin, its like nowhere else on earth. (craic=good fun to be had)   
Other than that, the other differences will be entirely subjective. What is one man's treasure may be another man's rubbish. You have to just decide for yourself.     
As far as Zurich is concerned, it speaks for itself. I think you are in a no-lose situation!   
Good luck

			The 70k / year entry salary for a Swiss FO was confirmed by my flight instructor yesterday. Caution - this is NOT Swiss International but their regional subsidiary SWU (sort of like Crossair reborn and deja vu all over again). Swiss is damn hard to get into, SWU is easier. Their hiring terms and conditions are fairly well published on   and on      
The 70k Swissies may be a bit less than a German F.O. at Lufthansa makes, but like all salaries, you gotta realize that taxes in Germany are a whole lot more brutal than here.   
Edit: CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Title 14 rules (also known as the FAR's = Federal Aviation Rules or simply the FAA rules or reg's) only apply to Swiss airplanes when they are over U.S. territory. Switzerland as an ICAO member is using JAR (Joint Aviation Regulations) which are issues by JAA (Joint Aviation Authorities).

			I caught a lot of CH german when most of my colleagues were Swiss... 
It's quite difficult to find an international company where the colleagues are swiss or german... 
On my 1st job here they were mainly swiss. On my present job they are from everywhere in the world...  
I guess you need to be lucky...

In answer to your question, the cost of living is extremely high: AUD3.50 for a loaf of bread and AUD40.00 for reasonable quality meat. Rents high too. Travelling easy, quick and reliable. Education good. Possible xenophobia somewhat difficult to deal with if you don't speak the language.

5882	Employment	Will RAV pay for German lessons?	white pine	2884	5	Winterthur	20.09.2007, 16:31	" 
			
			Hi there:-) I have been for quite some time by RAV so I have had quite much of experience. After you have registered normally RAV will send you to an information day - held also in english- and there you will have a test in german. If you speak no german at all RAV carries itself a german course which is paid. But I think that you do not have the option to subscribe to another school than the one they will indicate. In order to be eligible for some money allowance per month from the jobless insurance you need to send to RAV an application EVERY month with a number of applications that you have made in companies. Clearly this may be difficult for your profession but still that is what they want to see. And it is true that if something comes up even a less than 100% job then you have to take it. But for your field that will be quite difficult I guess. However even if a job appears you may reject it but you will have to have a good reason to do so and then either there is a penalty on the days for which you will get paid from the insurance or if you are lucky enough with the person in charge in RAV you may not have a penalty the first time at least. I have heard many many things about RAV but if you show that you are looking for a job and you convince them that you do then normally you do not have any problems...you only need some good nerves particularly aat the beginning till the person in charge---who you meet around every month--get's to know you a bit better.If you need any further help please contact me we could also meet if you like and discuss about it. When is your next meeting and in which RAV have you registered? Cheers Vicky

			Dear ALL,   
  This is my first post as the great threads have always clarified all my doubts. I need an advice as I could not find previous threads mentioning the local market for my area.   
  This week Ill receive an offer for a senior information security position in Vaud (Huge Global project and responsibility). I fulfill all requirements (making the difference...).   
  Im graduated in Computer Science with strong global project management skills and many certifications in InS/ IT area including:   
  Certified Information Systems Security Professional - CISSP 
  Linux Professional Institute Certified - LPI 
  SurfControl Top Achiever Recognition - STAR 
  Aladdin eSafe Certified Engineer - eSCE 
  Vasco Certified Engineer - VCE 
  Conectiva Linux Certified 
  Aladdin eToken Administrator Certified 
  Trendmicro L1 Certified   
  I know the employment conditions (relocation assistance, French classes, B visa - Im an EU citizen, etc) but I will appreciate your advice about the monthly/ annual compensation (salary) for the mentioned profile and possibly bonus scheme taking into consideration InS CH figures and my seniority.

			Health insurance varies wildly. Your company covers you for accidents at and away from work. When you get your health insurance you need to point out that your company is picking up the accident insurance (check that your  partner has accident cover included if they ar not working. If your partner sbsequently gets a job make sure you let the insurance company know or you will continue to pay for accident insurance even though its been picked up by you or their new employer.    
Do you do sports? Check when you get your insurance what's covered.A classic is that helicopter transfer is excluded and a maximum is placed on ambulance transfer. If you are going to do a lot of skiing or mountainbiking you'll need to take out special extensions. If you break your leg skiing the paramedics will arrive by ski and their first question will be ""are you insured for the helicopter"". If you don't want to stump up the small mortgage for the helicopter flight you go down on the slegde (ouch) and then pay for the ambulance ride back to town (double ouch)    
We pay 540 francs for a couple (270 each) in GHK's flex scheme which means we can pick from private (own room), half private ( two occupants per room) or normal (ward) and we get non-standard treatments e.g. osteopath thrown in. They also pay 400 each toward our gym meberships. That's quite a good deal. You can check for yourself on the COMPARIS website which compares all insurers across Switzerland.   
20 days holiday is boringly normal but check about office shutdowns over Christmas which can be counted or not depending on the employer. Also ask about ""betriebs ferien"" this is where there is an office shutdown over two weeks in Summer that is taken from your holiday right in the peak season ""convenient""!   
Beware the unavoidable but mean spirited Christmas holiday rules. If Christmas or New Years falls on a weekend it's your tough luck they won't reimberce the holiday either side of the weekend.

5891	Employment	Employment chances if previous job notice period was not served	swissvan	2248	4	Zug	19.09.2007, 13:19	"    It is not the worry about future employers - see Gooners post. No the problem is you have a contract that states you shall work 3 months after you resign. Now common sense says you will not exactly be motivated to work all of the 3 months at 110% as before unless there is some form of incentive so it is in everyones interest to ensure that you are kept happy by agreeing to your early release. However, the company can insist you come in every day until the bitter end and even pay out holidays owed. IF they insist on this right and you simply do not turn up ie you are not ""ill"" either then you are in breach of contract and that is not where you want to go. In that case they can claim for the damage you have caused which, although not limited to, would probably be the recruitment of someone to immediately step in to your role until they can find a replacement or the 3 months notice period expires. This someone would then be a contractor and you would be paying the bill ie the SFr. 150 per hour 9-10 hours per day...   
I don't think you want that do you?!

			Hi,   
As richard points out, at 8 yr. PQE your salary and package will be defined mainly by sector. I do know that in the pharmaceutical sector (ergo most of Basel!) as a business unit head of legal you should expect around CHF 200K, plus a package in line with most multinationals. The latter could easily be worth double the salary. The big bonuses are usually found in investement banking, however. Do not expect a car allowance, this appears to be a rarity in Switzerland.

			I've been looking up similar questions (Londoner looking to move to Zurich) and these are my answers. Seriously though, look up all the threads that are in any way relevant to whats on your mind and you'll get all the answers you're looking for and more. The ""more"" part is surprisingly important.   
1) As far as I understand, these days having a job offer and an EU passport virtually guarentees you a work visa? Yes   
4) Is there any rule of the thumb ratio you can use when being quoted a gross salary, with regards to percentage taxation?   
Married, centre-Zurich, no religion, zero children:   
 75k CHF = 11% 
100k CHF = 13.5% 
150k CHF = 18.5% 
etc   
5)  
- Less litter - I saw none. 
- Less crime - dunno. 
- Less issues with adolescent antisocial behavior - judging purely by amount of graffiti, litter, chavs, much less. 
- Better quality of life - dunno.   
6) I cannot speak german - Socially: you have to attain a basic level as soon as possible, there are no short cuts on this one. Expect people to be offended if you have lived in Zurich a certain amount of time without 'bothering' to learn any german. Imagine a frenchman who went to London to work for a french company and had only french freinds. If he didn't speak any english, which would be understandable in that circumstance, you'd still think he was a bit of a lazy snob. Re your job: dunno.

			Are you working for an International or Swiss company? What is your visa status?  I found that generally Swiss do not like to discuss salaries, but it is probably a safe bet that unless hired by an interantional company, you are paid less than a Swiss with similar credentials. If you you want to check on comparable salaries then get a name of a Swiss in a similar position to yours and go to the Steueramt and ask to see their tax return, that could give you an idea of how much they are getting paid.   
Otherwise pay a translator.

It is not really that well sign posted but easy enough to find. Alternatively you go to Handschuhsheim from Heidelberg following the tram line and then turn right into Handschuhsheim - you should then drive along and round the corner by the police station in Mühltalstrasse and then start driving up the hill (Alte Händesse is also at the start of this street and another great little local pub - I also lived in the hof at the back of this pub which was great for parties wasn't it Mark! - remember that one!!!) Sorry got sidetracked. You then drive up the hill as far as you can and it is signposted. Very very worth visiting....

			Thank you all for answering! Well it is true that having a PhD does not necessarily opens all doors...though for the specific position the subject of my PhD is quite relevant to the position of the manager. the company currently searches for two people- one as junior project manager for their engineering products and one for project manager in a department that is more relevant to my PhD. The thing is that following me showing interest in that department they proposed that I work 50-50 to both departments with the aim in 1-2 years to get the position of project manager int he department where my PhD is relevant. I think that this shows something. Becuase I expressed my concerns that what was offered was not representable of my qualifications and of what I could contribute to the company-through the contacts that I already have- they proposed to let me have an extra 7500 at the end of the first and second year as long as 3 targets that I will set up at the beginning of the year will be fulfilled and of course the targets will be such to improve the department for which my PhD is relevant. Even though I believe high on what I could achieve...I cannot avoid thinking whether these targets as they suggest them would be possible to meet withi normal working time. I need I guess to clarify with them about overtime...cause after 5 hrs of interview and at 8 in the evening was not more possible to discuss....practicalities..!   
As I am looking now intensively for a job I realize how this process of intervies is so hard psychologically in many situations...so thanks for providing also your own experiences:-)

			Hi Sandra, 
there are plenty of jobs for nurses both in Vaud and Geneva, however most will require fairly good french. 
I used an agency in Montreux, there are  a few  specialising in recruitment in the medical field.   
I would approach one of the private clinics which attracts international clients. I will be working in a private clinic. I know that they have recently employed an nurse who can speak very little French, however she is always working with a french speaking nurse, and many of the clients are non francophone.     
 You could always post an advert on this website too, The agency which found me a job contacted me after seeing an advert I had posted  on this.   
 good luck 
Jo

Salary for a Swiss-hire = 
0.5 to 0.6 x a UK salary

1.3 to 1.5 x a French salary 
0.5 to 0.8 x a US salary

			I've been let go from jobs 3 times because of downsizing or the company closing so I know how much this sucks. Your husband does not have to tell anyone yet that he has lost his job; he is still gainfully employed for another 2 months. What are the chances of finding a job in that time? If he gets a new one he won't be unemployed at all. He can also sign on for unemployment benefit, which if it comes to that he should do so at least 2 weeks before the end of his contract. This was my experience of being made redundant in Neuchatel & Zurich, he should check if the rules are cantonal based.

NORMALLY permits are issued that are open to unemployment but not always and there have been many cases some here on the forum where after paying in for 4 years, someone finds they are not entitled to unemployment benefit. The USUAL case is when the person is a student or working for a university in a non-lecturing role or when the person is here as an ex-pat, but theoretically it can happen to anyone. The deciding factor is whether you are integrated into the Swiss employment market or not. With integration you have entitlement.    
It is very difficult outside of asking the alien bureau to know what status your permit gives you - at least I know of no other way.

reflecting on both your job search, application, interview, and negotiation process will do wonders for your career.   
At least....it seems to work for me.

I see now that both links point to the same table of the same lawyer, so treat it as a single source.   
Sometimes employers add a declaration to their reference that they don't use codes. The sentence goes ""Wir bekennen uns zu unkodierten Zeugnissen"", but I don't know how common it is.

A three   for 1500CHF, maybe. Remember, in GVA one of those rooms is the kitchen.  Of course, GVA is in a housing crisis: there is very little choice on the market. You'd be better off using 1800+ for a calculation for lodging. You might be lucky and get something outside the city for that price.    
You'll probably also pay more that what you budget for food, especially with a growing child. Don't forget if the car breaks down or if there is some emergency. Furniture, clothes, public transportation if only one has a car, day care, going out (ever), travel if you need to fly somewhere, etc.    
I'm not saying it CAN'T be done, but it won't be a particularly easy way to live.    
You should look more for at least 75-80,000.    
And again, your biggest hurdle will be the permit. I'm not sure you will get one for the kind of work you are talking about. Nothing is impossible, but some things are much more difficult.

If you want to live in the city...apartments are extremely expensive and food isn't cheep either.  
You will be able to make a living but I guess you care about having some savings as well....  
If you would get a job as well...than the offer could be interesting otherwise do not accept the offer. You will need at least 150000 CHF a year...

			I suggest you call instead of sending you CV directly for a position where really think you are a perfect candidate. Don't call when you know they wil never consider you. Explain your situation very shortly on the phone (as a good communicator, you can do this, or otherwise prepare by writing it in max 3 sentences) and follow up 2 weeks after sending your CV. Are you sending your CV to companies or agencies? Agencies can tell you probably quite easily where English speakers are required and German is not necessary. When you have good programming skills you should be able to find a job in this market.  Another suggestion is; are you seeking only permanent roles or also contract? Maybe write your salary expectations in your e-mail. With overqualified people, the problem is normally that ""managers"" want to much money, give straightforward your ""schmerzgrenze"" as they call it in German. An agency will normally tell you honestly when you can get more (since they earn a percentage on what you earn, it is better for them to have a higher salary as well) 
good luck.

The great benefit - and drawback - of radio as a medium is the extent to which the whole business is carried on within the imagination of each listener so everyone has their own image of the scenes and the people involved uniquely from the dialogue and the sound effects.  In some ways, perhaps it is similar to the difference - occasionally enormous - between a well written book and a well made film of it.  So often the film disappoints not because it is innaccurate in conveying the author's message but that it does not correspond to the ideas and images  that the reader conceived whilst reading.  What do you think ?

			Some old fashioned recruiters - and there are still many knocking around - can't read. I mean it: they can see the black squiggly things across the page, but don't understand what it means. Getting someone who can read is a godsend: they'll be able to look through your CV and understand your potential. Getting this far is something, in my experience.   
Frankly, Bachelors degrees are becoming more and more irrelevent. Seeing as you have sound experience and knowledge in your industry, that should scream out to the recruiters that you're valuable. Emphasise your experiences: 'this is what I can do!' Perhaps ask the recruiter directly if they have objections to candidates without a Degree. Their answer should tell you a lot about how professional they are. Good luck!

			There is a   which is actually quite detailed (comparative cost of a shirt for example, which is useful for when you lose yours in Zürich). Its been discussed on other threads, but an important point to note is that all the comparisons depend on the exchange rates at the time, and the dollar is currently down'n'out. And of course in the words of the great Bessie Smith, Nobody Loves You when you're down'n'out.

			Hi all! This is my first post here... 
I've been attentively reading all posts and decided to go ahead and post my question. Does anyone know a reliable school which is looking for language teachers and doesn't mind having non-native english speakers teaching ESL or EFL? 
 Although I hold a Masters in ESOL from an American university and got a few jobs in the states as  a  native (never lied but employers assumed from my accent and fluency that I was native) it seems to be hard to convince employers here in europe that one can actually be a tremendous esfl/efl teacher even without possessing a passport from an english speaking-country. I even have experience as an EFL student so I actually know ""my business"" from the inside and can anticipate problems students may encounter when studying the language.   
Anyway, if you do have some information about it I'll honestly appreciate it. 
Thank you.

			Regarding German lesson, they have German lessons in the offices with a local very good company all bought and paid for (Group lessons though obviously)   
Regarding the salary, at banks these things are generally tied to your position and level, salary increase are generally low for the whole population (the pot was 5% for everyone this year). Bonuses are good as is pay with promotion and the increases are significant.   
It is a great company for fringe benefits and the Business School is very good. Well done for joining the major bank in Switzerland (from an investors point of view).   
Enjoy, it will be challenging, but fun.

			Hi, I am really interested to get some info about the health check ups that are made at the swiss work place. I haev lived in Sweden for many years and know from experience that these are not yet available for all employees in Swedish companies - but get the impression that this is becoming more nd more ""standard"". My question to the forum is  - are these health checks routine in CH? obligatory? part of the health service?  Are they more normal in non-swiss companies ? I am educated within HPB (making health profiles) and am hoping that this is something that I am going to be able to work with in the Bern/Thun area.   
The organisation that works with this in Sweden is called HPB - but since I have no clue what the equivalent of this is called in german - its tough to search on the net.   
grateful for all tips,

When i was in Switzerland in 2004, there were very few english jobs, but when they arose they required specific skillls that I felt I did not have. Now with my education and additional experience I feel I am ready to move back but the language skills is still a concern. i will let you all know how I go! Thanks again.

6061	Employment	Finance job with tons of education but little job experience	Marvin	1750	0	USA	08.04.2007, 19:21	" 
			
			Hi, 
I am new to the forum although I have been browsing it for a while. I have a question about the probability of getting a job.    
My husband is discussing a transfer to Geneva or Lausanne. He is not EU citizen. I have a degree in Math from Moscow State, diploma in Economics from LSE and PhD in Finance from a good (15th from the top in Finance) university in US.    
I worked in Russia in banking for a couple of years in the 90-s but it was more management position with responsibilities very specific to Russia in the time :-)) I also worked in London in a major investment bank as an intern on fixed income intenation desk in 2000. I liked the job but did not like the hours (from 6:30am-6 pm). Such hours are absolutely out for me now as I do want to see my kids not only on the weekends.    
After I completed my PhD in 2003, I did not look for a job and I stayed at home with my small kids. Now not that I need to find a job, as we can survive with only my husband working, but I would like to find an   job in quantative finance and preferably in Geneva or Vaud. All the ads that I've seen are predominantly for Zurich and with German. I am not completely against learning German, but I do not think that commuting between Zurich and Geneva daily is an option for me. I have some knowledge of French, can read more or less a text and will try to improve my communication  skills.   
Cutting things short, is it reasonable for me to hope to find a job in French speaking part of Switzerland, or should I begin learning German and thinking abt Zurich? Or the chances for me to find a job with non-EU citizenship are really low and I should just stay home (in US or in Geneva/Lausanne) and do something else, i.e. not working?   
Thank you in advance for your comments.

			You really need to find out what salaries are typically offered in your field (you don't say what that is in your post). Check out a website like   and you will get some idea of what is on offer for your field/skillset. Then check out some estate agent sites to get an idea of what your housing costs will be. Only you can decide if a given salary suits your skills, qualifications, and cost of living needs. You might try to get an answer to your question on a site for expats in England as well (an internet search should pull up several options for you).

			Good morning the community!   
Well, I'm French in fact, and have a proposal to work at Autodesk. I am now well aware for its products & company profile, but I would like to have the ""on-site feeling"" of some employees:  
- Are you happy with your life at Autodesk? can you detail? 
- Is the way of working and management at neuchatel in line with the US international Headquarters values (as stated in their website)? and with the ""Fortune"" magazine statements? 
- Is it possible to move from Switzerland to US or other countries after a first experience there?   
Thanks in advance!

I originaly come from Slovenia, and the reason for leaving Sweden is low wages with our jobs, and very expensive live here. 
Me and my wife are both with masters degree, me with Pedagogy, and she with EU economics, and supervision. 
Here the wages are low, like i wrote before, and we both earn aftertax about 2200 euros, which is not enough for life here with this standard. 
How  much is the average salary in Swetzerland at the moment, and how is labour market?   
Thank you one again.

			Hi a lot depends on your frame of mind and personality. Be prepared for rejection from jobs you know you could do if it wasn't for the language barrier. It's obvious you love your partner and your up for the main haul. Good attitude, a plus point for you.  I've been through the whole culture shock thing, but what kept me going was all the people who thought i wouldn't make it.  
I cant tell you that it will be easy but if you have the right frame of mind and your willing to accept the different mentality you've already got a head start. 
Rule no. 1 it's you who are different, not them.

Joking aside, I am looking for people interested in becoming Pilates Instructors  or who are already qualified to work in my studio. With your medical background and good people skills, I'm sure you could find Pilates an interesting change in career.   
Many people have started to look at a ""second"" career in Pilates as a balance to their desk bound jobs or as a second career when they have small children and need flexible work hours. If you enjoy working with people and have an interest in movement and the human body why not consider this as an option?

I really would not read too much into this yet, the fact is that your name alone on the resume would suggest to them that you are not exactly local, so if the wanted to kill of your resume they could do it right there and then.  However, someone turning up on their door step with a B permit already in had might seem s bit strange, so they just may want to check it out before they go any further.

			Hi TJ,   
Saw your post and thought I better get off my backside and join the forum as I can actually contribute something.   
I have been travelling in Europe for the last 12 months and did the ""summer camp"" experience last year in Leysin. It was pretty full on work but a bit of fun.  I worked as a activity counsellor (teaching climbing, mountain biking and taking the little darlings on walks up the mountains).   
They also require english and french teachers for the language program.  It seems a pretty good set up and the teachers get paid more than the activity counsellors (its still not a great deal but you have free food, accommodation and not much time to do anything). There are guys from Australia, UK and heaps from Canada - so it is a great way to meet people.   
The company is Village Camps   and they are based in Nyon.  I think they are starting to recruit fairly soon so I would get your course done asap - or think about being an activity counsellor. They also do outdoor recreation programs in the Spring and Summer in Leysin and Anzere. This program is much more interesting, but you do need some outdoor experience. I may be back there if I don't find something soon!!   
Hope this helps and feel free to contact me if you want any further details.  Leysin is great and at least you may get to see your girlfriend a couple of times a week!!   
Cheers

			My (recent) interview experiences showed me that HR here are far more involved than any in any company in the UK (at least in my experience). They will tend to ask all those - to me - horrible questions that you never even think about, let alone know how to answer.      was somewhat helpful   
Be prepared to answer truthfully about facts that are on, or can be gleaned from, your CV/Resume. After 16 years they are bound to ask you why you want to leave or why you did leave, so have an answer prepared that shows you in a good light and don't just moan about your present employer   No matter how bad they might be    
Do your homework on the company first because they're almost sure to ask you ""what do you know about our company"" and you don't want to look at them blankly (I had this question at ever Swiss company that I interviewed with!). That will also lead you to questions you want to ask them, and I usually try and find one or two where I already know the answer and can offer a comment about having relevant experience, skills, or interest.   
Finally: ""good luck""!

			If it's Myers-Briggs tests then think of their ideal person for that role, and answer the questions accordingly... ie: 
- if they want an extroverted friendly outgoing marketing type, then answer all the questions as though you were that sort of person 
- conversely, if they want a thoughtful analytical backroom computer geek type, then answer the questions in that way 
Of course never tell them that you would do such a thing - they of course will say: no no just be yourself... 
And if anyone pulls you up for this and says: your profile says that you are very extroverted (or geeky) - give us an example - then be prepared with examples...   
Also, they will probably ask for examples of times in the past when you have demonstrated leadership/teamwork, or guiding/helping others - think of examples beforehand. It could be newbies in your group that you mentored, or junior team members, or times that you stood in for the boss when they were away, or when you represented your group in meetings with others...

			I don't live in Switzerland (yet   ) so can't given specific advice about breaking into the Swiss IT industry. But I can give my 2c worth about the IT sector...   
First of all I've been in IT on and off for 10 years and I think it's a great sector to be in! In my 20's I loved to travel and work in different countries and being an IT contractor made this easy. I've worked in sectors other than IT and, for me at least, IT has been the highest paid, lowest stress environment. Others may think differently but that has been my experience.    
In terms of breaking into the industry I think the first thing to do, as Cantarell mentions above, is work out what you want to do. There are a huge range of potential careers within IT. Some of the obvious ones include network support, development, software testing, business anlaysis, project management, etc, etc. Of course you can always change once you're in the industry but I think you should have a rough idea of where you want to be in 5 years and work towards that.   
Once you've worked out the area you want to be in certification can help you get your foot in the door. I've worked as a Business Analyst and Systems Tester and have found that, especially for getting that first job in a new market, it helps to have a recognised certification. Some certifications are very easy - I've done a couple in software testing that even someone with no experience could pass with a few days preparation. Even given that, they are still held in quite high regard by some organisations / recruitment agencies. So you may not learn much from doing them but it will help pad out your CV, especially when you have limited experience.   
When it comes to actually finding a job my advice would be to get your CV looking very polished and professional and then start sending it out and making the calls. Dealing with agents can be difficult and I've been let down many times by dodgy recruitment agents. What I do now is try to get an impression of the agent. If they seem OK and seem to have integrity then I try and build up a bit of a relationship with them. i.e, rather than just e-mail call them to discuss possible roles, etc.   
If you are finding it tough to find work in Switzerland, maybe you could consider trying some of the other european markets. I'm from New Zealand and started my european employment in London. I didn't particularly like living in London but it was definitely easy to find work there.    
Anyway, that's enough of my ramblings .... good luck !

6119	Employment	Temporary contract and AHV payments	gbn	2784	7	Switzerland/Malta	16.02.2007, 08:40	"    That's not strictly correct. There are many situations where people are self-employed or do temporary work for someone for less than 2,000 per year. That doesn't make them a ""schwarzarbeiter"" (a so called ""black worker"", or someone who works in the informal economy and doesn't declare tax).    
To say you'll be without pension is also not correct. If the income is declared to the tax office (as it is supposed to be) then you'll be sent a bill so that your pension contributions match your taxable income.   
As for being left without a pension, I'd argue that people who pay today will be left without a pension tomorrow anyway, but that's a discussion for another thread...   
As for the  ""Schriftenempfangsschein"" they know where you are anyway, because you have to register where you live in any case. The stupid piece of paper serves no purpose except to add to your stress if you lose it. Having a piece of paper sitting in a file in some government office adds absolutely no value when it's all stored in a computer anyway. The country can survive without foreigners having to mess around with it, so why subject the Swiss to it?

			Hi all,   
I am new to this forum and have been lurking around for the last few days, and it has given me some pointers about life in Switzerland. The threads in this 'Employment'-section has been particularly useful, but I would still like some more feedback regarding job interviews, from you who are now working for a Swiss company.   
My situation is that I have been living in Tokyo for the past few years during my Ph.D-studies, but I am now seeking to go back to Europe (I have a EU-passport) and move away from academia towards a position in the industry. Switzerland seems to fit many of my requirements to provide for a good life with a family, and after struggeling with Japanese bureaucracy I believe I shall be able to overcome and accept any quirks the Swiss system might throw at me. Now, I found an interesting position at a large medical technology company, and I will have a first interview by telephone this week. I suppose there must be a lot of people who's been hired from abroad on this forum, so I would really appreciate any information on the interview process. How many interviews did you go through? Did they fly you over? Did they help with the relocation and housing issues? and so on...   
From another thread I learnt that the process in general is rather slow, often taking several months before a contract is signed. The salary level is of course also on my mind, but judging from the posts I have read it is really difficult to get a clear answer to this as there are too many factors weighing in. I made a search on salaryexpert.com and got a quote of around 145000CHF yearly salary-median for an engineer in my field, but that does seem rather high - my initial thought was somewhere just above 100000CHF gross, but maybe that would be selling myself short. I do have strong academic credentials, but I am not sure how much weight a doctoral degree carries in Switzerland, so any thoughts on this would also be highly valued.

It is well worthwhile actually getting your equivalent title checked out and put on a card IF it is any way relevant.

			Hi, In Geneva you can expect to pay 4,500 chf per month for 4 bedroom apartment with 2 parking space in an OK area (more in a flash apartment block/area) 300-350 chf per week for groceries. 700 - 1000 chf per month health insurance. English schooling starts around 6,000 per year (pre-school) up to 23,000 per year (high school). I don't know what age your children are, but babysitters and out-of-school activies/clubs can be expensive. 
As for your wife working to increase your income, this is not as easy as it sounds. Here in Geneva children generally go home for a two hour lunch break and there's no school on Wednesdays. So your wife would also have to be a professional on a good salary to cover the extra childcare. 
Hope I've not put you off, you really need to get your company to cover some of the above costs. Children are expensive (but worth it) no matter where you are living.

			Hey, does anyone know if there is a way to do a praktikum with an english speaking company in Zurich?   
Im interested in opening new paths for myself, career wise, and iv heard that praktikums are the way forward in Switzerland. My experience is very broad but not specific, having spent 3 years travelling and working all over the world, and working in lots of different positions but never really specialising in one particular field.   
Basically my qualifications are 6 Scottish Higher certificates, from high school. Highly regarded in the UK, they can get me into nearly any university.  
Retail experience for 2 years, photographic experience, I managed a restaurant in San Francisco for nearly a year, managed a backpackers hostel in Australia... picked mangos and banana's for a living... 
like i say, broad but not really specialised.   
I want to be in Switzerland to be closer with my girlfriend, and as I have found work everywhere else i have lived in the world, i thought i would give Switzerland a try, but i understand its a little more exclusive. 
Would a praktikum help me here, or is there any such thing even available to me?  my german is basic, but rapidly improving...   
any help is much apreciated...

Maybe you can help me with a good advice. I am a new grad telecommunications engineer and for quite some time i've been looking for a traineeship, they call it ""stage"" in french, something for new graduates. In my country, it's been impossible for me to find, ALCATEL didn't have any by the time i graduated, unlike for students that graduated last years, though in my 5th year of studies we had a course by ALCATEL about mobile communications and my grade was 9 out of 10.i found out about Swiss Occidental Leonardo, a program for new graduates from several countries including Romania, i sent my application to them but i'm not sure they can help. They tell candidates it is better to look for a ""stage"" themselves. I've been searching over the internet, i don't know if in the right places, but i haven't found something for a new graduate like me.my mom is a family doctor and has been recruted by ARIME to work in France as a GP, in the next months we're supposed to move there, but i still want to find something in Switzerland, because i love that country and i'd also like to apply for a master there in the next few months. i also speak french and german, though my vocabulary in german is not the very rich.
I would appreciate if you can give me any advice about where to look or what to do, like i've said, i only have academic experience and the projects from my study years, i can also get recommendation letters from my former professors, one of them working for IBM.

			You don't need to hint: just tell them the additional cost of living in Zürich and (maybe) your need to maintain a home in the uk when on posting, and posssible travel expenses, plus additional tax advisor costs to sort out the tax situation, plus one-off relocation etc etc.   
If its a big corporate, they should not be surprised by you asking for any of this. The potential may be limited depending on if you are a local hire.   
In any case get it  This is important, as future salary raises are based on what you are currently getting. Go into a job at a low salary (if with temporary expenses) and you will forever regret it, as you will constantly paying catch-up.

			Hi Folks, 
I moved to Switzerland back in 2005 and was working for UBS IB for about 15 months as a permie.   
I went into the role with open eyes but having previously been a contractor I found I missed the money (additionally I'm trying to get a deposit for a house).   
I'm looking for a contract Application Support/Unix Sys Admin role, English speaking, in the Zurich area.   
I have 6 years experience and other than UBS I have worked for Accenture, RBS and Alltel. My ""Zeugnis"" from UBS is excellent.   
I've found non-UBS roles pretty scarce over the last few months (not surprising around xmas I guess). Is this likely to pick up after the February bonuses are announced?

			It really varies quite a bit. If she is a proper praktikantin, then it goes from marketing places who pay nothing at all, over to the roughly CHF 2000 - 2500 a month I've heard from a lot of my friends to an hourly wage of, I think, 27 Francs where I work.   
So, essentially, it's probably best to find someone who was a trainee there before and ask what they got.

			you will pay local and national tax (that's two segments), social deductions and pension contributions, health insurance.   
your employer pays for accident insurance.   
There are no poll tax or council taxes; they're dealt with in the local part of tax.   
Effectively your deductions should be between 25-30% in total.   
Aim for a B permit.

			Hello just have some questions-   
1. Hire and fire laws in CH? Employee or Employer friendly? In general is CH an easy place for hiring and firing employees (full-time and part time)?    
2. If someone is a part time  worker without any contract then can they be fired on the spot after working 3 years in that job?   
3. I have been asked to sign a letter backing my employer against a fired employee. Witness to real events that show that the fired employee was fired rightly for being a big ass. This x-employee has taken my employer to dispute court as their ego is severely brused. If my employer loose then would it be held against me in anyway? OR in some sort of record that will count against me even though it's not a criminal matter and does not involve me directly? It's typical work related dispute between employer and employee.     
That would be all for now. thanks for any help. I have obviously written only as much as I could.

			I would say it is good as your house, insurnaces and kids day care/schooling ids paid. You are left just with car, holidays and household.  
Car inclusive of Insurance and fuel for your kind of family (I would say a 2 ltr combi or a mid size SUV) should be around CHF 800 to 1200 (although this is very relative depending on your choice and preference). And another 1000 or less for household. For outing and travel you can have the rest or may be you'll prefer to save some of it.   
I think you are comfortable.

			Hi All,   
I'm a Canadian/American currently living in San Francisco with my Swiss boyfriend. We plan on moving to Zurich for about six months starting in November 07. I'm starting to look around for opportunities and this seems like a great place to get advice! I speak English and French fluently, I am an intermediate German speaker (but probably would not pass the German test for fluency, maybe by the end of the year). In my hunt for jobs in switzerland it seems hard to find anything which does not require a visa already, or which is not located near a ski resort!   
My questions: 
1) Are there any job sites which list temporary jobs in English? Are there are any jobs sites which list exclusively for foreigners? 
2) I am currently working for a major national retailer as a merchandiser/buyer in HQ. I would be very grateful if anyone could lead me to a fashion/retail industry contact in the Zurich area. I love this industry and would like to continue working in it! 
3) If that is not possible, I think I would enjoy working in the tourism industry as a temporary job, does anyone know a good website which could lead me to tourist jobs for foreigners in the zurich area? 
4) Any other advice on the temporary job hunt would be appreciated!

If you are looking to work in the hotel industry, with lots of experience i would have thought you should find something. At least you have been to interview. Sounds positive. At least you are making demonstrable effort to learn the language.  
I couldnt recommend a recruiter for you, however would be happy to run a couple of ideas by you if you want to drop me a line directly.

As for the great washing-up/fast food debate. I know someone who once got rejected by mcdonalds.(oweee) I met her when she was earning herself near enough six figures. I guess it doesnt always pay to aim low.(ps no she wasn`t in `that` profession before any commedians make suggestions- ha ha)

			I think your chances would be quite good.  Check out Monster.ch for jobs and you aill see there are a lot of banks looking for backgrounds such as yours (think risk management and VaR stuff as well as other mathematical things).  Salary I would not be so sure, someone on the forum working/worked for a bank should have a better idea - Somewhere above 80,000CHF I would imagine (plus bonuses) - or something lower to start in a internship program.   
The lack of experience might be a problem - without fluent german I don't think you could get into one of the training programs in the big banks which operate a lot on german..so work hard at it (I wouldn't worry about swiss german)...It depends weather in 2 years all the bank stocks are still way up and they are still searching for lots of Quantitative people - you might want to check out all the bank job sites now and apply for some jobs, maybe you don't even need that MSc...

6173	Employment	Employment Question	ElGuapo	3448	4	Texas	18.12.2006, 07:04	"    Hi,   
I would suggest first that you take an LLM. This will get you into Switzerland with a B permit to do the course. There are several universities offering this in both the French and German parts and I believe the course is in English   
Once you are enrolled and studying your foot is in the door. From then on you can go to Student fairs, where large employers are represented and someone will more than likely take you(90%).   
It is not possible as a non-EU to practice law in Switzerland, unless of course you spend the few years studying for their bar exam. You can take on a role as a legal or general counsel for a company but not actually practice. If you are an EU qualified lawyer then the situation changes.      
If you want to apply directly then check out the big companies, UBS, CS, Nestle etc. They usually have openings for business qualified lawyers although preferably with a second or even third language.    
If you want to ask more questions feel free and I will answer them in time.

What do you exactly mean by work permit situation? I will be studying already when I will be applying to jobs in Switzerland. Does that mean that I will have a work permit? (i thought part-time work is allowed for students)  
Also, I think my only option is BSL for now. It is kind of hard to make the choice of leaving the US for me, because what if I do not get any job in Switzerland after graduation from MBA? It will be tough to come back to US.  
I guess the main question is: how hard the process is compared to US jobs and H visa procedure (work permit for United States)?

You can find a number of sources for HR questions on Internet. Sites like Monster have a interview tool that is quite usefull. If i remember correctly, U of Kent helped me a lot. I would recommend you to compile a list of * typical * questions and learn their answers before yougo there.    
Never been at Rocher or Novartis (yet....), but  was interviewed several times by  competitors/companies in related fields. In all cases HR did the * standard * interview... If i were you, i would ask for an agenda with the people who are going to interview you in that morning. You probably will get the odd questions made by future bosses /internal customers/co workers.    
Best of luck,

			Just some other comments : 
- usually they say that you should not pay more than one third of your gross salary for rent. You should be able to get a 2.5 Zimmer Wohnung (1 bedroom flat) in ZH area for around 1,400 - 2,000 Sfr/month depending on how much luxury you need, lake view, near train / tram stop etc. You will need to look at several before you get use to what you get expect / value for money etc. Sounds a lot but usually its high standard 
- Living expenses (food, restaurants, drinks etc) are high - but not nearly as bad as London or some other major cities 
- If you're single - stay in the city. If you want peace & quiet or have kids then move out to the surrounding countryside 
- If you stay in the city area - you won't need a car. Some have one for skiing etc - but the experience of getting stuck on the motorway to and from ski resorts at the weekend whilst whatching an express train wizz by really pisses you off... 
- in the insurance biz - you should be ok with English. Don't bother trying to learn German before you come: The dialect here - Mundart or Schwyerduetsch is very different. Most Swiss people don't like to talk High German - you can slowly pick up the lingo or even enrole into Swiss German classes once you're here. You will make friends much quicker if you at least try to say a couple of words   
Be more specific with some of your questions - its easier to give a more helpful reply   
Good Luck 
All the best

6192	Employment	Are certifications worth their salt?	Richard	2084	13	Luzern currently	22.10.2006, 20:41	" 
			
			There is also a requirement for some organisations to have a certain number of people with certficate X in order for the organisation to be at a certain partner level. So in this case if you need 10 or 20 people at a certain certification level, then you are bound to get one or two ""not so good"", or maybe more...   
Interesting article at the start of this thread, I hardly recognise any of the top 10 's.    
There are a whole bunch of reasons why an individual wants certifications, some just like taking exams   "	2565	 May 2005	6	['4', '4']	['720', '373']	6

			In reply to Mark & Dave 
Yea it was dangerous, but I have been working in HK with the same company, it's an relocation, so I know the company's behaviour to review every year anyway. So I'm not that worry about that, it's just a matter whether the amount would reach my expectation this time.  
And if it doesnt work, I could also go back HK and work with a better salary offered there. The fact is I'm pretty sure they don't want to lose me here at the moment, as I'm the only Asian on my team who knows about Asia so much better than the rest in regards of their business behaviour and of cos operational wise.    
But I do agree, if you start your contract with a new company, then would be a risk to do what I've done.

6195	Employment	IT Salary Lausanne	Adzia	2930	1	Ireland	17.09.2006, 01:17	" 
			
			Hello Adzia   
I m not in the IT field but im working in lausanne, so according to your working experience I think you should expect a salary not below chf 120k. Salary in Lausanne is slightly lower than in Geneva or Zurich, but the living expenses are lower accordingly.   
You should be able to find a very nice 3 room apartment with great view to the lake @ chf 1,700 per month in lausanne city, and even cheaper in the suburbs.

6197	Employment	SYNA rejects my unemployment benefits money:please help	postdoc	3293	16	Zurich	31.08.2006, 15:10	"    This would seem logical (though unfair). If someone is here with a permit tied to a single employer, then in theory why would they qualify for unemployment benefits to look for a job that they theoretically aren't allowed to take. Once the job ends, they are supposed to leave the country.   
If that's the way it is, then that's the way it is - but postdoc does raise an interesting point - why would he then have to pay the insurance? To be fair, he should really be refunded all of his contributions, since he should never have been paying in to it in the first place!   
Anyone else out there on a B permit which is tied to your employer, and which doesn't allow you to switch? If so - you'd better check if you are paying unemployment insurance or not!

6198	Employment	Urgent: unpaid leave + tips on legal aid	muze7	2845	2	Uk now	31.08.2006, 00:24	"    I believe most of these have been answered before.    
a. AHV Yes, IV Yes etc BVG No as this is a percentage of salary earned.    
b. The others potentially revert to nominal amounts depending on the length of leave. AHV for example can be paid even after you have left Switzerland.   
c. Absolutely not unless this is written in your contract.   
d. Forget unions they are more or less irrelevant in Switzerland. The best you can get is to have rechtsschutzversicherung which covers Arbeitsrecht. Furthermore there are several good books you can get for reference. Ranging from the basics to an explanation of the Rechtssprechung.   
As for sources I would have to check but I guess the first place is your pension policy for the BVG and try looking up OR 324 - 330c with google and see what you get! These are the main parts of the law relating to working and leave a lot open as you will see...

6200	Employment	Working in Financial Zurich without German	Fly-Swiss	4851	13	Geneva	25.08.2006, 19:01	"    Hi, firstly it is entirely legitimate and legal to request fluent Swiss German or Swiss French. It is illegal to request this as a mother tongue. And it is furthermore for certain professions entirely acceptable to have Swiss citizen but this is rather the exception. Professions such as Notar and Policeperson are good examples. Notar is interesting however as this can be a self-employed profession as in Aargau or working primarily with German customers as in Basel... But you must have a little red book to do it...

			Hey Pedigreeman,   
Sorry to hear about your situation, I know how you feel. Unfortunately I am not really au fait with the type of situation that you are in, but as far as I am aware if you don't accept the conditions then your contract is terminated from their side, and not a mutual agreement.    
To be sure, there should be numerous sources for legal advice nearby (or at least in the main city of your canton. Usually unions and the Arbeitsamt offer legal advice on a no-responsibility basis).

			there are more [and larger] pharma firms around Basel so more choice.   
having said that, I don't have a chuffin' clue as to what you could expect - I assume you want to work in business [R&D] rather than educational?  I would assume R&D would be quite rewarding?
