Thought I could help out on the equivalents for the french-speaking cantons:     crèche - early child care, nursery, typically from age 4 months to start of school (4 years)   state-run crèches – costs often linked to income level; availability depends often on where you live, your parental status (e.g. single or two parents), and whether one or both parents work; hours tend to be fixed and yearly closings (vacation periods) substantial; the city often centrally organises the application process; not all towns/communes have creches, especially smaller ones   private crèches – often have greater flexibilities on hours and less vacation periods; possibilities for alternative languages or bilingual; costs are same for all, based on the attendance, full or partial days/days per week.   garderie – group day care for children of all ages    jardin d'enfants - typically for young children, ie. toddlers, although some use it interchangeably with crèche; schools (private) that start at age 3 often call the class jardin d'enfants   maman du jour – mother, who along with her own child(ren), watches other children during the day; some are centrally coordinated by the city/commune   UAPE – Unite Acceuil pour Ecoliers, term coined in the law in Canton Vaud for providing various day care possibilities; UAPE provides before and/or after school group daycare and possibly the midday lunch period for school age children. Organised by the commune typically in conjunction with the school, although the premises may or may not be at the school.   pre-scolaire = providing care for children under the school age (ie. less than 4)   para-scolaire = providing care after school hours for school age children   Ecole/Classes Enfantine – the first two years of school, ages 4 and 5, known as 1ere Enfantine, and 2eme Enfantine. These two years are generally not mandatory (cantons vary on this, please verify) but as typically 95% attend, it is more or less expected that they attend   Ecole Primaire - Primary school, starting from age 6 and attendance is mandatory   Age of children for start of school – this depends on their birthday and varies by Canton significantly, so check locally to have details. In Vaud, if they turn 4 by 30 June, they should start school in September. However parents may request either delay attendance, for those born during May or June, or accelerate attendance, for those born in July and August, under special request. Note, the request may or may not be granted.   Streaming levels – depending on the school and Canton, around 4eme-6eme, the public schools stream children into 3 tracks           HarmoS—a federal initiative to harmonise most aspects of schooling among the Cantons; has not been approved yet; although some cantons are already moving towards harmonisation in some areas. It is generally well liked and accepted in the French speaking cantons, but the opposite is true in the german speaking cantons.   Care for sick children-- In Geneva, the Red Cross (Croix Rouge), via the Chaperon Rouge, can arrange for urgent care of sick children. In Nyon, the Red Cross offers this service as well.

From Pre-School, Primary School, Precollege (English/German): Schifferhaus, Bonergasse 75, 4057 Basel. Phone: +41 (0) 61 260 20 00 
College (English): Margarethenstrasse 47, 4053 Basel. Phone: +41 (0) 61 260 20 80                
academia International School offers full-time international schooling  from preschool to qualification for university entrance.   
Our student-focussed teaching aims to make the best of the individual talents and abilities of each child and to promote the joy of learning.   
Our bilingual   teaches children the preliminaries of reading, writing and calculation as well as promoting their learning, social and action skills. An individual instruction plan focusing on the strengths and aptitudes of each child is developed by native speaker teachers. A combination of guided learning and supervised playing phases offers an ideal environment for children to learn a new language.   
In our   the teaching concept is based on immersion and individual development of the specific aptitudes and abilities of each child. The teaching language alternates on a weekly basis, with lessons taught by a German-speaking teacher in a German-language environment and an English-speaking teacher in an English-language environment. Each class is supported by a language teacher. This serves for enhanced development of linguistic skills of the children by a method that we call ""immersion plus"". Children study in small classes and follow an individual study plan specifically tailored to take into account their individual talents and strengths. This prevents children from being under- or over-challenged.   
Our bilingual   prepares students for entry to our College. Focus is on academic-style study in a homogeneous class environment. Some subjects are taught in German and some in English. The teachers are native speakers.   
Our four-year English-language  prepares students for an international higher education entrance qualification called A Levels.   
Our college programme prepares students for IGCSEs, A/S and A levels. Students can join for 2, 3 or 4 year programmes which is ideal for families who may have to return to the UK or US when their child is 16 as re-integration is straightforward and we have families whose children transition seamlessly to UK 6th form colleges after IGCSEs. Our examination results last year were very good at A and A/S level with over 100 students sitting exams 83% passed with C+ and 44% with A/A* across subjects. At IGCSE level 83% of students passed with C+ and 40% scored A/A* across subjects. We provide full support and guidance for the UCAS application process as well as the process to enter US colleges including SAT test preparation.  We also provide full support and guidance in navigating the wide variety of options within the Swiss system. A levels are accepted by all Swiss Universities and Fachhochschulen.   
We also offer IGCSE English 1st language for English speaking students who are in the Swiss system and wish to make sure their English level is sufficient should they wish to transition to UK Universities. These classes can be organised on Wednesday afternoons  please contact us directly for details.

			According to the  , there are only two Universities that offer accredited paralegal studies. They seem to be in German though. One of them, the ZHAW offers courses and programs in English, if you want to look at  . The other is a distance education University that seems to offer no courses in English.   
I do not see the point of doing your paralegal degree abroad, if working here is your goal, because law firms would prefer to hire someone with knowledge of Swiss laws and knowledge of the local language. (unless you work for an American law firm, or a large international one, where the main language is English)   
I would apply for either internships at law firms or for administrative jobs at law firms (such as this one  ) and gain work experience that might eventually give you access to a paralegal job here. At the very minimum, I would invest in a language course though. Most law firms would welcome a fluent English speaker, but without the German (or French, or Italian), other candidates will be more competitive.    
Wish you all the best.                      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Paralegal certificate	"""Sss"	Posts: 8	477	6	Education

If something did come up, I think it will be for 4-6 years. I will have to look into the compatibility between US and Swiss public schools to see if returning will be a problem.

			If I were an English-speaker looking for a job, these are some steps I would consider taking:   
1. Meet with RAV for job search ideas (while recognizing that RAV will not likely provide unemployment compensation). 
a. Request access (a code) to jobagent.ch 
- Use this database to search for English speaking jobs 
b. Inquire whether RAV would provide support for an A2 German course (after the MigrosKlub is completed)   
This link lists RAV centers in canton Zurich; Richterswil residents use RAV Thalwil:       
2. Search indeed.ch and job-room.ch on ""English"" for jobs requiring English   
3. Search on ""English"" on other job boards listed at aso.ch:       
4. Do the above three mornings or afternoons a week and repeat!    
5. Consider joining a volunteer group to develop contacts, e.g.:      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Sep 2016	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Educational and Career Attainment for US Citizen Moving to Switzerland	"""RedSoloCup"	Posts: 7	2,383	34	Education

13	19.12.2016, 20:53	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: Saudi	"    You will have to look at your school curriculum for that.   
At least the first two years are all in local language anywhere in Switzerland, if you open the UNIL website you can see by yourself. I really suggest thorough research. 
You can always do intensive french courses all summer and start with normal courses now. As you probably know Switzerland is a multi-lingual country and a lot of people do this and succeed even if they didn't study the language very well in high school. 
Money-wise you can live with 2000 per month, survive with 1500 if you're lucky but lausanne is expensive. Also I guess you will need funds upfront to get a permit and for rent deposit. This is excluding airplane tickets. 
You don't buy books at university if you cannot afford them, you don't really need them for biology and students share the PDF versions if you really want them (or you can find them yourself). 
Work is very difficult to find, some work but without the local language it's impossible imho (considering you can only have evening and weekend jobs). 
Try getting a scholarship or a zero-interest loan from your country.

Incidentally, the topic sounds fascinating. I'd start with the higher primates, designing experiments like putting a banana high up on a book shelf with a chair nearby to see how they solve that. You require 2 groups an one control group. One group is informed that bananas are nice to eat, the other that bananas are not nice to eat, and the control group is given no guidance. 
After that, progress onto humans.

I would share with Alessandra her opinion about   in Lugano, my son went there four years ago, they actually opened our eyes that he has an autistic symptoms, and after him diagnosed as Autistic spectrum they were very helpful providing him a special teacher (for a bit more additional cost) that took care of him and was sooo helpful. 
Since the last year, they opened an elementary-level branch (for children from 3 till 6-7 I think). I know they run montessori pedagogy, and from my experience, they are open to special cases if you explain your child's situation to them.

			Hello everyone, I have been, for sometime now, looking into MBA programs via distance learning or at least flexible studies.   
I know pretty much about all available programs from UK universities and Swiss universities. I have looked at respectable rankings from Financial Time, the Economist, etc.    
However, I have found the Executive MBA a the University of Geneva ( ) which cost is very affordable.    
It looks like it is AMBA approved only and I could not find any ranking in the above mentioned publications.   
Have any of you had any experience or know anything about this MBA program?  Or at least have references about the University of Geneva and its school of Economics and Management?   
Any information would really be appreciated.   
Thanks a lot.

No changes since 4 years since all children moved from school and i guess this will be repeated soon.... I experienced it myself the principle showed his real face and threatened us as we asked too many questions about firing well experienced teachers and being replaced by cheaper personal with less skills.

			Thanks BelgianMum. We went to a parents' evening for the 6-12 class and were quite impressed by how they plan for the reintegration at the end, but I'm still interested to hear any other stories of peoples' experiences, in particular if there are particular things to look out for or ways to make the process easier.   
Both of our kids seem bright and are doing well at the Montessori school, but for me it seems like a stretch to be able to look at the character of a 5 year old and say if they are likely to easily adapt at 12 to the public system.

			I moved back to Switzerland with my kids, then 11 and 12, and registered them immediately at the local Swiss school. They didn't speak or understood any German. Now they are bilingual in all three languages. But school wasn't a big help. Because I grow up in Switzerland and also teach German I was able to help my kids a lot but  it took a long time. There was no English at home anymore, no English TV, only German books, no mixing with English and of course a lot of tears. You don't have to be so hard with your kids of course, but a privat German teacher 2-3 times a week would help a lot. I hope that helps a little

			You will not be able to ""book appointments"".    
The teachers have no time to tend to you. State Kindergarten belongs to school - the teacher has to teach, she or he has also no possibility to take only those children they like. You have to take the brats, too. They have to take what children are assigned to their Kindergarten - as you have no chance to make your pick. Especially hard if you drop in during the ongoing school year.   
It is different with a private kindergarten but you will have to pay out of your pocket.

To give you an idea, the homeschoolers' group where I grew up (Midwestern US, rural shading toward suburban) was a pretty diverse mix of the following:    
- religious families with a range of more or less religious/cultural concerns, some curricular and some peer-pressure based; 
- hippy/creative families who worried that typical classroom settings would stifle individuality and prepare kids only for a life of conformity and meaningless wageservitude; 
- academically intense families who found the local public schools not challenging enough and the private schools too religious; 
- special-needs families who felt undersupported by the local system and believed they could do a better job themselves.

			How old are your kids? If they are young, I think any of the public shools in villages you mentioned are OK. But when they grow up and have to go to college, it is a different story. Some villages are small and don't have their own college (after 8p) and kids have to go to the neighboring commune school which might not be a good one.

			No it doesn't.   
The St. Gallen MBA is ok. But the university's strength is in their MS/MA degrees, not their MBAs and they pale in international comparison. Whether that is justified or not or whether the right criteria are being measured or not - in general that is - is a different discussion.   
The MBA is not a guaranteed career accelerator like it is in the US. It may be a slight advantage in an MNC and/or in the financial/consulting sector, but only if from a (highly) reputed institution. Outside of MNCs, many won't even really know what an MBA is exactly, and they certainly won't care.

			You won't find Montessori teaching in any public schools, although some teachers, if you are lucky, may include some Montessori methods in their teaching, if they are interested in the methodology. That said, teaching methods are changing even in public schools, and a lot of teachers, especially ones fresh out of teacher's college employ more and more open methods of teaching. 
Bilingual public schools are only available in Biel, but all the Passepartout cantons: Berne, Basel Stadt, Basel land and Solothurn teach French from Grade 3 (8-9 year olds), 3 lessons a week.(basically all the cantons that border the French speaking cantons) and English from Grade 5. All other cantons teach English first, then French. Any medium sized town should offer the activities that you are lookign for. Our village Gymnastics club is for instance more competitive than the one in the closest medium sized town, but the town offers skating and tennis as well. So living in the countryside is not out of the question, public transport is good and the kids can travel to the next town for activities by themselves.

I just checked and the German version of the document is from 2013 and says exactly the same about Gymnasium as the english version.   
(sorry for posting in German) 
Gymnasium (Mittelschule) Schülerinnen und Schüler mit sehr guten Leistungen können nach der  6. Klasse ein Gymnasium, eine Mittelschule, besuchen. Bis 10. Februar (für K + S Gymnasium 15. Januar) müssen die Eltern ihr Kind an ein Gymnasium anmelden *. Das Kind muss eine Aufnahmeprüfung bestehen. Die Erfahrungsnoten der Primarstufe werden berücksichtigt. Als Erfahrungsnote gilt bei Schülern der 6. Klasse der Primarschule das Mittel aus den Noten in Deutsch und Mathematik.   
Furthermore my child went through this process in 2016 and I have read nothing to suggest that the process has changed for 2017.

			I was a very advanced reader and after I had read out the whole library at my school around grade 5 (teachers were just glad I read in class in German lessons because I had already mastered the curriculum) I went after  my parents bookshelf and read all of the greek mythologies and was enthralled with War and Peace. Years later, that made me the pet of my German teacher!   
Although skipping a few pages when the generals talked about war tactics, I thought it was absolutely fantastic, shed some tears about Natashas and Pierres love story. There was also a heavy book about martyrs and saints which I devoured.   
I even read an erotic novel which I found quite weird but interesting :-) Only years later I realized what it was about...

Last and only batch of students who passed out of grade 6 made it to the Gymnasium, all of them, which goes to show the school's rigor and attention. I would recommend it. Only negative is that the students are not as fluent in german if they come from non-german families.

			Hi,   
Im not sure how active this thread is now, but I just came across it and I actually got my MBA through them, so I figured I could give me 5 cents worth.    
The previous poster is correct, the degrees are awarded through their partner universities - i.e. University of Cumbria for the MBA. The Robert Kennedy college (based in Zurich) is an intermediary and they basically offer the online portal to your tutors, who are not necessarily at the university itself but can be from other institutions. For my marketing course I had a guy who was the owner of a marketing firm in California, who I checked out thoroughly, and he's a very active professional in that field; the same goes for the Accounting tutor who was working for a very well known Fund company in Switzerland.    
I also felt a little weird about signing up, but it was the only MBA I could afford at the time. I visited the RKC in Zurich to do some diligence and was a little weirded out it existed in a tiny office in a huge building in the middle of an industrial estate (yeah, exactly) but the University of Cumbria definitely exists (its actually very pretty, all the more so since no one has heard of it) and the MBA through them is actually a legitimate course.    
They also do around 8 other courses, e.g. MSC in Project Management, and it is said that the online degree is exactly the same as that obtained by a regular day student.    
Anyway, I hope that helps. The main issue is that with an MBA, you get what you pay for and I had a couple of hundred spare, I would have gone to Harvard - or a more affordable IMD but that was still out of my pocket range unfortunately.    
Personally, the course was really worth it but I definitely missed the networking aspect that a traditional course can offer, especially one at a more reputable known business school. All in all, my MBA took my 3 years (part time) and I really enjoyed the experience.    
Hope that helps someone, if anyone wants any more info, just drop me a message -

			Hello 
I am a young adult who is interested for some time in animated movies in two and three dimensions. I look for people who could help me do the dubbing of the characters in English or Spanish for example. 
You can view some achievements here, to understand what I mean. Thank you for your suggestions.

			Greetings,   
I am in my final semester/year of my master studies (social sciences) at UNIGE and therefore am planning for the next step  --> PhD.   
I wanted to know some general requirements for getting into a PhD program and getting funding for my PhD studies. More specifically how competitive is it? Do I have a chance with my current background to get funding? Also if you know any sites that offer funding (besides the national science foundation) please let me know.   
- My MA gpa at the end of my studies will be between 5.1 and 5.25. 
- Age 24 
- Bachelor in Public Policy and Management from the US. 
- Work experience: 1.5 years for NGOs 
- Non-EU   
I know the answers depend on the program and funding organization, but just wanted to know the general view of my application profile. If you have any additional comments or suggestions please let me know.   
Thanks in advance.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Oct 2015	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	PhD Studies	"""Timmey"	Posts: 4	463	0	Education

I can't really talk about 'repeating' - my kids were in Montessori preschool and Primary school, and they all did an 'extra' year of primary school because of the age cutoffs being different from Australia to Switzerland, but it had zero impact because they didn't actually 'repeat' anything - same teachers, mixed-age classes and they didn't notice when they were re-graded as they weren't officially 'graded' in Australia at all, just put in age groupings... their age didn't change...    
I assume, being twins, that they were born early. If they are very close to the cutoff date then regardless of being twins or not, I'd always suggest putting them into a high-quality early childhood programme and then having them start the following year as the 'oldest' in the cohort rather than the youngest. It might not seem like a huge difference at age 4, but at age 14 the difference between one adolescent and another can be enormous...and being little is definitely a disadvantage (especially for boys)...

			Good morning,   
I am also moving to Zug from the UK with my two daughters, aged 6 and 8 and we have enrolled in local schools.  I hope to do some 'home schooling' once they have settled in to help keep their english up, especially with my youngest daughter as as she has just about grasped reading.  I'm bringing materials from the UK to help support them but would also be interested in finding out about availability of native english speaking tutors in Zug.  Thanks.

			Plenty of options as others have explained. Now it seems it is too late for your family- and perhaps you had absolutely NO choice in the matter- but just in case anyone else is reading the thread- I personally would avoid moving to another linguistic area at this key stage, if at all possible - even if it means one parent commuting back home at the week-ends.

At least for the children's primary school and get the italian properly into their brain, changing canton when they are 10-12 if they have good grades and repeating a year to get the German going really good. Actually a good plan.

85	27.06.2015, 14:15	Forum Legend	Thanked 3,548 Times in 1,804 Posts	Location: here	"    It must be very, very frustrating for a teacher. I can see the point of some parents though. Why is homework so important? The parents probably never did any themselves and they got on fine without it. Why is school so much more important than football training, or playing the guitar? Football stars earn enough and remember John Lennon's aunt? ""The guitar's all right John, but you'll never make a living out of it"".   
Many families have no connection at all with higher education, their only acquaintance with 'degree holders' is their doctor, the dentist and the teacher. Maybe they are not over-impressed and don't think these jobs entail 'real work' at all. If they understand Swiss German and travel on an early evening train they might hear the Gymi students talking. ""No, can't come out this evening, got to learn a bit for a test tomorrow"" ""Aw come on, it isn't that important"" ""Nah. I really must. I didn't bother for the last two and I need to get my average up a bit!""    Learning things just to 'keep one's average up' doesn't sound a convincing argument for 'education' to me either.   
Maybe the parents feel their child is/will be  discriminated against whatever they do.  Have they heard that youngsters' applications for apprenticeships go to the bottom of the pile if the surname ends in 'ic'? Do they question the need for 'profession of father' in the forms for kindergarten entry?    
Don't get me wrong, I think anything done to help the youngsters is important, but we don't need to convince each other here, we need to re-programme the parents (and sometimes the teachers too) to give them as much help as we can.

			At 6 years old at arrival my daughter learned spoken French very quickly in local primary school and soon became fluent. Her reading and writing in the local language has probably suffered though. She had an interest in reading but always read English books and had an Anglophone environment at home which I think doesn’t help with school. I think this held her back through the rest of the Swiss system, becoming more of a problem at each level, but in the end she scraped though the Maturité and is now at Geneva University. If I had the money, and a time machine, I’d probably send her to an English speaking school but that would probably mean not being able to go to a local university, again that’s problem that money would solve.

			Hi.  I don't have information about Zurich but I would urge you to contact a variety of international schools and ask them the direct question about how much skilled support they can offer.       
I've taught a lot of kids with ADHD and Aspergers  so understand the difficulties, from one side at least.       
How long are you planning on staying here? (don't have to answer).  That would potentially have an impact upon the choices you make.      
Again, just thinking out loud and I absolutely don't need an answer, but have you consulted your child's doctor to see if they have any ideas?  They may also have some professional contacts in CH who may be able to advise you further.       
Wishing you and your boy peace, whatever decision you make.       
Best 
Rufus.

I totally agree with the person above that any applied field a Ph.D is not necessary for your job. Sometimes a Ph.D degree is even holding you back from getting a job. However, if you really like a particular Ph.D topic (I mean you absolutely love it) then you should go for it.   
To finish a Ph.D it will cost you at least 4 years, it is quite a big decision. If it is possible I would like to suggest you to work as a lab assistant in the lab you would like to do your Ph.D and feel whether you really like to do a Ph.D. Good luck anyway!

			This is the teachers college that offers training for Kindergarten teachers in Lausanne:    
If you want to teach in the public system, this is the kind of school you need. Your master degree may not be completely irrelevant, but you would have to contact them to find out. Your French however may not be sufficient. I would imagine you will need at least C1.

			The two adults I know who started learning piano aged about 40 and 60 respectively, bought electronic pianos, so they could play with headphones and not drive their respective partners and neighbours crazy.  Both said this was immensely liberating, giving them the freedom to play absolutely any time.  That way, they got in far more sessions of ""just ten minutes"", which all added up.   
Some music shops will rent out instruments, on the understanding that one can convert the rental contract into a purchase, later on. 
And there are always second-hand instruments, such as here  
and here   
... although to make such a purchase, I'd take along someone who can play really well, to test the instrument in the seller's home.     
Oh, yes, and well done for learning German. 
Could you perhaps do a two-in-one by getting piano lessons in German?

108	02.09.2016, 01:52	Junior Member	Thanked 3 Times in 3 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    The way they do it here, you don't need more teachers to accommodate a bigger entering class. You need a bigger lecture hall, and you need a few more grad students to run extra tutorial sections - but grad students are a dime a dozen anyway so that's no big deal. (Finding  for them to hold the tutorials in can be a challenge, but if push comes to shove there is always some other department's building with spare capacity, or an advanced seminar that could meet in someone's office instead of having its own room, that sort of thing.)   
The professor does not grade homework or exams - certainly not for those massive first-year courses - so it makes very little difference to her workload whether she teaches a course with 30 students in it or 300.   
In practice I suspect a year-to-year spike of that magnitude is about unheard-of. You're more likely to be looking at fluctuations of +/-10%, i.e. 90 or 110 incoming students where you expected 100. Any department that isn't already bursting at the seams can easily accomodate that sort of thing (and departments that   bursting at the seams actually welcome the overload: it's short-term pain but it bolsters the case they have already been making to Admin that they ought to be allocated more space.)

			Correct, well educated does not imply intelligence, and vice-versa. Precisely my point. The comment that the rich are automatically smart is ridiculous. Just because someone lives on the Gold Coast and has a rich dad or granddad or whatever does not make anyone in that family smarter by default, let alone will they have a broader horizon due to ""discussing a wide variety of subjects"" or ""taking trips in the summer"". That is an absolutely stupid conclusion. In fact even the opposite may be the case.    
The only bit that is correct is that the rich may simply buy their kids' education.    
There surely is a correlation with nationality or cultural background or however you want to put that. No doubt about it. However, we are hardly speaking low-skilled immigrants here, aren't we. Wherever OP will end up, it probably won't be in the slightly ""shadier"" (difficult to use that word for Switzerland) suburbs of Geneva. And whether he sends his kids to public school in Seebach, Zollikon, Wetzikon or Thalwil will hardly matter much.

			An internship is a   employment for a limited period of time, usually max. 3-6 months, as part of your curriculum.   
Anything that doesn't require you to be there all the time is not an internship, but simply a part-time job.

			Try an app for your phone/tablet, search for abacus apps.  For kids, I recommend Abacus Adventure.  Master Soroban and Komodo are good for practice, but it will need to be a parent-child activity (tutorial is not good enough for kids to follow).  There's also a Korean ""finger counting"" app which I've heard good things about for developing mental math skills.

			Hi There,   
I am in the same position of FgV (also Anglo Italian family)two children currently in British schools in the UK. Daughter starting year one and son starting year 9. Planning to move to Geneva in the Summer 2017 and staying in CH for not longer than 5 years. 
My biggest concern in the difference between IGCSE and GCSE. 
At my son's school the do the first GCSE in year 10 and I believe that is how it works in the uk with new school reform. 
We have an appointment with the British School of Geneva but I would like some feed back if it's possible. I am afraid Swiss Schools aren't an option for us as we plan to return to the UK at some point. 
Thank you 
Silvia

			Hello guys,    
let me introduce myself, I'm finishing next year a double bachelor in both Mathematics and Economics, and I would like to continue for a Master in finance but I'm asking for some help to choose the best one for me. 
Also i would like to work in Switzerland after graduating.   
My first choice would be of course St Gallen for its reputation in finance world, but if I'm not accepted, I don't know about UZH master in banking and finance, HEC lausanne master of science in finance or ESADE master in finance.   
ESADE has a pretty good reputation in London especially but what about Switzerland ?   
And what about the two others, HEC lausanne has a good reputation in Switzerland but I don't know the reputation of UZH in finance ? An other point is that being in Zürich would help me to learn German.   
So I need some help from you guys to choose between those three, tell what you would do and why please.   
Thanks guys for your time and response

			I had class mates in high school who did an additional year of kindergarten because they were not ready, it's actually quite common. There's also people that even takes a gap year, the so called tenth year. 
The age difference doesn't matter much, you identify as part of the same age group of your peers anyway. There's also a lot of natural variation some people at 14 look like they're 12 and viceversa so no problem there either. 1 year less might pose problems, 1 year more for sure not.

			it's never too late, my grandmother started learning German in her late 80s. Everyone learns differently, so try to find out which way you learn best. For me full immersion works best, but if I can't be in the country whose language I want to learn, I use a combination of textbooks and speaking comprehension, either via tutor or via online learning.

			Dear Marko Polo, 
From what I read, your focus is on the best possible academic achievement for your kids. Local Swiss schools certainly provide a very high standard of education but their focus is not just on academic learning but on fostering a strong sense of independence, social skills and on catering for a range of educational outcomes - from vocational training to university entrance degrees. If you want to enter the local system, you should be open to all these options ( at least if you are staying longer term) and also to the fact that the route to Gymnasium (aka A-levels/ higher secondary leaving certificate qualifying for university entrance) is restricted a lot more than in most other countries. In other words, expect the local system over here to be very different from what you might be familiar with! If you have your mind set on a particular outcome for your children, the local system might not be the best option for you. Ps this is coming from a local school adviser with children in the local system!

			It will be something like this i guess (this is from last year)  
so they have you follow some bachelor courses basically. 
It's usual in switzerland to have master students from foreign universities take an extra semester, as a filter, one year is kinda long but i don't know the program, it's very competitive and prestigious it seems so it could make sense. 
This should all be explained in the admission dossier you received, I'm pretty sure there will also be the contact of the student dean which is the responsible person for this stuff. 
I guess it will help you get your french up to speed and be really ready for the master but sure, it's expensive to do an extra year.

Are you aware that you need healthcare? If not, apply for it as fast as possible.   
As swisscanmom wrote, contacting BIZ   is a very good idea to get more information about what you can do to get an education who will help you to make a living here.   
Forget about a loan - since you have no securities like a regular, paid job - you will not get anything.

			Sorry, can't help you about this particular school.   
But I can recommend Sprungbrett, where my son goes, and it's ""mother school"", d'Insle. Both schools are excellent. Sprungbrett takes kids from 2-3 until the end of primary school. D'Insle also offers Krippe from 4-6 months in addition to Kindergarten and Primary School.   
Both are bilingual German-English (plus French at Sprungbrett) and follow the Swiss school calender, unlike many international schools.

Nearby Nidau and Port are the areas where the wealthier part of Biel population is living and even though they are not officially bilingual, you will not have problems with communication. In Biel, northern lakeside and hillside have the nicest accommodation options.

			Hi there   
We moved from abroad to Switzerland and like to keep our daughters English up to speed. We live in Männedorf. Does anyone know a private tutor or is there a good English school for afternoon classes on our side of the lake (gold coast). Also home tuition would be an option. I'd like her to get familiar with the reading and writing so that she eventually will be able to read English books. 
Thank you

			I think you have an excellent plan. I have two kids in the International School of Schaffhausen. Started at ages 6 and 9. The 6 year old, in retrospect would have done fantastic in local schools.They are great in Switzerland, and at the ages of your children, they will pick up Swiss German in no time. IMO, many swiss schools are a superior education to the IB international system.

R itself is free software, as are the 8,000   (and counting) free add-on packages. Also lots of free courses, on Coursera, for example.    
Python is the other obvious choice. It shares many of the advantages of R and is easier to learn too, but not (yet) so good for big data and statistics.

For us, Krippe was all day - one parent dropped him off and the other picked him up. 
Our area had a Hort for lunch and the children would go there for lunch and in the afternoon after Kindergarten. 
It was brilliant until the school authorities got all safety-conscious and stopped the Wednesday afternoon skiing and other cool activities.      Outside of school, there are plenty of Italian clubs with restaurants - with or without (usually with) the boccia. 
But like all these things, you may find nothing in common with  the people there and the only connection you have is that you all have Italian roots.

It depends how these labels are used.  Kids need IEPs (individualised education plans) after assessment because even if a determination is made, it doesn't follow that every child with ADHD, for example, needs the same support - they will all need different approaches.  Labels can do more harm than good in some cases, I believe.           
I don't know.  I've encountered parents who were desperate for their child to be given a diagnosis simply because they couldn't cope with/manage their poor behaviour and then it does become bad parenting.  Teacher's can't pick up all the behavioural slack - it has to be a partnership.  There are always underlying reasons for ""difficult, oppositional and underperforming"" and sometimes we parents have to step up even further. I've even known a parent go to their doctor to try and get a ""Prescription"" to help with the issue of their child never doing homework.  An extreme, ridiculous, entirely true example.  Needless to say, the parent was unsuccessful.      
I've taught kids ""diagnosed"" with ODD (Oppositional Defiance Disorder) which means that, fundamentally, the child cannot cope with being told no, cannot manage being ""nay said"" at all.  The reason?  Usually they were indulged entirely at home and couldn't adjust to a school environment where they weren't continually pandered to.  ODD tended to be a last hurrah ""label"" when nothing else would stick.   I am fully aware that it's a real thing, and a true sufferer must be dreadfully difficult and exhausting to deal with.  However, some, to paraphrase  Brian's mum, are merely very naughty boys (and girls).       
If I'm ever hauled in to see Little Rufus' teachers, I'll not immediately be reaching for a label.  If she's being a little bugger, then I'll want to know.  Then we'll manage it with the appropriate support if need be and hopefully route out the root cause.  I've seen too many kids stigmatised with ""labels"" that they either never needed in the first place, or outgrew as they matured.

			Hi, me again.  
My girls have just started in the Zollikerberg school and are loving it so far, despite the language barriers. Their teachers speak English and make a good effort to make the daunting event of coming to a new school much more welcoming by assigning a buddy who can help explain things in English in the beginning. They will have DAZ classes twice a week to learn important German in a fun and effective way. We are early days and so I don't know how long it will take for them to feel confident with the language but that aside I can see happy, interested children who look forward to going back to school the next day. 
At this age, as long as they can play together friendships are easily formed and the Swiss kids at the school seem super sweet and helpful. 
Hope that helps!

			I could write a book on this subject.    
Before we came to Switzerland , in 2001, we diligently interviewed the international schools, especially in regard to our nine year old son. He was diagnosed with language processing disorder (dyslexia), low working memory and slow processing speed. The international school (no name...) assured us of their special needs' capacities. Since we had been ex-pats for many years, it felt normal to continue in the international school system. Only, this time, my Swiss husband was no longer an ex-pat, but a local employee. Just the same, he had a good job and we made this choice, without any great hesitation.    
Well, two things:    
Firstly, jobs change, as do benefits. Take consideration of the long term financial implications of having a child with special needs. The international school also asked us to engage  shadow teachers, to accompany our son to school. Then, there were extra tutors and therapy, most of which was paid privately. In the end, we both had to work to pay for it all, which only increased the stress and gave us less time with him.     
Secondly , although the international schools can be lovely places with wonderful educators, they are not always the best choice for your child. If, at any moment, the school can no longer can meet your child's needs, your child may be asked to leave. Education is a long term commitment.    
I don't know your child, nor would I want to discourage any international experience, but it should be done with caution.    
Fast forward 15 years, and we are about to split our family between two continents (thus the giant moving sale...)...for the mere reason our now 24 year old son needs to   in English.  A very long story.....

			From personal experience Carouge is 'good', so apparently is nearby Troinex.   
This is another one of those 'how long is a piece of string' questions though. Without knowing where your workbase is (so where practically you need to live), and how old your children are it's difficult to know which areas we can recommend you start apartment/house hunting. After you've moved into an area the children will then be allocated school places in whichever local school has space.

			Personally I did not find the admission process to be hard, though I applied for Mechanical Eng. I think computer Science is more requested, and therefore there might be more competition. The process is relatively lengthy and a bit expensive by european standards (150CHF or so), but everything is explained in detail on the program website. You will need quite a bit of paperwork (degrees, certifications, letters of recommendation and possibly translation), but nothing out of the ordinary...    
In my program admission requirements are not that ""stellar"", I got in easy (with good grades from my bachelor and decent recommendations, but far from anything exceptional). Unfortunately there's no way to tell, so, I suppose, it's better to just try.

			I took the GRE last summer, I studied for about 4-6 weeks and took as many practice tests in test conditions as I possibly could. If you do this and memorize the patterns and types of questions, you will do fine.    
Make sure you use the practice books that are made and published by ETS as they are the people who make the actual GRE test. I tried the kaplan and princeton review books and they are ok, but the ETS practice tests include all of the subtle things that the actual test will have.

He complete his 3rd grade this summer and has a fair level of high German and has been tested through the cockpit tests. He has picked up swiss german in the Hort and is a native English speaker.

185	12.04.2016, 14:15	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 4 Times in 4 Posts	Location: Travelling	"    I gave the same suggestion in my first answer. Odd, perhaps, but pragmatically speaking, it can help.    
You are teacher? Have a degree that one western country recognize? English very good? The only line missing in your CV for Swiss and many sought after international schools in Europe is the lack of experience.    
Where is lack of experience not a problem? Where there is little interest from experienced teachers... and Asia is a place with many schools that are not exactly the most popular places to settle down for most international school teachers, including Beijing where people don't like to stay for ever because of pollution.    
Another idea is to go where there are many new IB schools, like in Northern America, not only US and Québec included. Perhaps also schools known for not paying well but with good academic reputation (the only one a friend of mine named is Roma, no evidence of that other that this one witness).    
Simple logic: The less turn over, the harder to get in. Popular places to settle down like Switzerland or popular european cities have low turn over, that's all. I know the one in Hamburg: They had three positions in total for teaching staff last year.    
That being said, dear OP, there is a new international school opening in Hamburg, so you might want to have a look. New schools are not attractive for experienced teachers, they can't pay that well, uncertain future, hardship of new starts bound to happen etc. But it's wonderful to set up a new school, young blood is good.

			Any ideas of where to visit on a 2-day trip to Lugano to give us a feel for the culture, education and kid-related activities available? We will be there around August 10-13th so I'm guessing the public schools are closed - correct? Or would some staff be there to possibly give us a quick tour? Any other places we might want to visit to give the kids (ages 6 and 10) a vision and positive feeling about moving?  Thank you!

			Credit Suisse used to offer a loan to those doing the MBA at St Gallen. Repayments were deferred until graduation, but interest accrued while studying. No bank is going to give you an interest free loan. The interest rate was lower than anything you could access under normal circumstances.

			I taught IB Biology for eight years in the US. The IB curricula is quite prescribed though the teaching methodology is flexible. You'll want to familiarize yourself with the course guides (specifically the sections titled ""Syllabus Content""-- yes, it is extensive) to make sure you are covering the appropriate topics and level of detail prescribed in the curriculum. Make sure you know if you are dealing with SL or HL.   
There are a number of great websites as well as course-specific textbooks from Cambridge, Oxford, and Pearson that directly follow the IB curriculum. Lastly, IB has a very strict academic honesty policy so don't give too much guidance on any internal assessment (or extended essay if you're asked to help).

			Nobody answered me...in case anyone finds this information useful. 
I was able to send the application, however I haven't received any response, after more than two months.    
Not even a rejection letter. 
I've called and phone lines seem unplugged. I've sent mails asking for information. There's nobody there. 
I found this very frustrating. It's totally a non-swiss way to do it. I'm giving up for this chance to study there, even though I think I have all the requirements needed. 
Just wanted to blow off some steam, although I know no one would read this.

			All our kids did an extra year of school when moving from the Australian to the Swiss (German) System...   
What advantage to a child is there to finishing school at a younger age than everyone else ? I really can't see it...I have never seen a child who suffered from being older than the other kids, only kids who suffered being the youngest (and lacking both the stature and emotional maturity to hold their position socially)...   
My middle child is 14 and not started puberty properly yet. He is now the second-shortest child (including the girls) in the class. Lucky he has a positive group of kids to hang around with, but he must feel pretty small amongst the older kids... we put off having him do the gymi-test this year and he will do three years of Sek, before trying next year because some of the kids in the class will be two years older than him, as well as being a lot bigger!   
My husband was a 'high potential' kid, back in Australia, his birthday was one day after the official cut-off date for kindergarten, his grandmother was the headmistress and there was no bending the rules, so his parents put him in a private Kindergarten for a year, then back into the government school system for the 'correct' age...he was still a high potential kid who was at the top academic stream, but he was also the right age for the rest of his peers...   
Our own kids do Montessori school. For us at Montessori 4.5 is late to start... we start them from 3 but they do more years total of 'school'... and they can flexibly and seamlessly add years without any stigma...

			ZIS has 4 locations. Early childhood, middle and senior schools are in Kichberg/Adliswil area, Lower school is in Wadenswil.    
Most  families live around the Kilchberg-Adliswil-Thalwil-Horgen-Wadenswil-Richterswil belt (Americans don't  need to come to low tax areas further up). Pull up a greater Zurich map  and you will see it on the left side of the Lake Zurich. Depending on  which campuses your respective children go to, Adliswil will be kind of  equidistant to your office and Wadenswil.   
You don't need a car, but with a family of young kids it may be an attractive alternative. Most expat families with kids have a car.   
There are other international schools in Zurich and Zug that you may want to google up. ICSZ has a single campus and has more of a UK school influence. ZIS more of American influence.

			There's a ton of threads around with input. Here's my experiences from the ETH.     
I did my Bach/mast in Canada and came here for the PhD.     
As you might know, every Swiss student who has completed their Matura (I guess the equivalent of A-levels?) are guaranteed entrance to the bachelor program. 
The first year is considered tough with 50% not making it through. There is a lot of material and a lot is intended for self study so students must be very self motivated. 
Many of the final exams are verbal one-on-one with the Professor--so they can make the exam as easy or hard as they like depending on the student. If you fail something more than twice (I believe) you are essentially banned from studying that topic indefinitely in the rest of Switzerland. 
Bachelor courses are generally all in German, Masters courses generally in English---but many are in German---look at you specific course requirements. 
Zurich is expensive for a student, but student fees are essentially nothing (compared to Canada). Best idea is to find a shared apartment and be prepared to pay quite a bit for social life, eating out, living.     
I think that's a good start---ask away any further questions.

TOEFL score does not matter much.  What I know might be important is at which university you got your bachelor from. ETH tends to accept applicants from famous university easier than other universities

You need a high school diploma to get into ETH, be it the Swiss Matura or not, at least it seems so going by the info in this link above.   
And as I mentioned in my question, they do not yet have one.   
Huge thanks again to Nixi. I put them onto the isme school nixi mentioned and they found out they can do the Matura part time over three years or full time over one year.

			I feel bad asking again, as I posted a very similar question about Nyon, but apparently we are going to live in Morges, instead!   
So I need to start my search of a solution for our 2 yo again - I already regsitered him by the public waiting list, and they already found him a (actually 2) maman de jour -- but I am not really fond of this solution: the location is not so convenient, plus I would really like our boy to be in a more ""structured"" environment.    
Besides my motivations: I am checking for private crèches (while waiting for a public place) and cannot find much, especially NOTHING downtown! How is that possible?   
I found 2 or 3 (Cap Canaille, Little Green House) that are quite far and all bilingual FR/EN (my boy already speaks Italian and German, I would like him to first learn French, English can wait...).   
So, is any of you by chance aware of a place that keeps children all day long downtown/not far from the station? Or at least not bilingual?   
I am tempted to scan to whole town via streetview, but I am not sure it is the most efficient approach    
Thanks for any help!

			Hi, 
I am a parent at SIS for 2 years and I have to completely disagree with you. When there was lice in the school (as there will always be a possibility of this happening), SIS had all the kids checked and sent out letters on how to treat the lice. They continue to check on a regular basis.    
Regarding your comment on the school being a ""revolving door with little personalization"", that is so far from the truth. Almost all the teachers know my kids names, even if they have no involvement with my children on a daily basis at school. There is always a teacher with a smile greeting the kids every morning. I am happy that my kids attend SIS and its worth every penny!!!!

			I did Stufentest B1 at AVS-Baden Sprachschule last week. Overall, I got 90% of total ""sehr gut"" mark and the test consisted of written (schriftlich), hearing (hören) and verbal (mundial) part. Although unofficial but it should be equivalent to TELC or Goethe Institute test in terms of difficulty with a difference, that in case of the latter, the results will be sent to Germany for evaluation. At least, this is what they claim.   
I'm planning to do Stufe B2 course in the future and then attempt the officially recognized test worldwide afterwards. My previous teacher had told me that there was a huge difference between B1 level and B2 level but not that much between C1 and B2 respectively.   
In any event, I was told that one shouldn't attempt those tests without prior preparation because there are lot of stuff to tackle e.g. grammar, sentence structures, sophisticated vocabulary and exercises testing capability of reading carefully to arrive at logical answers. Allow yourself to spend few hours repeating the text book at home and only then tackle the test.

			It looks like that things are going to change soon:   
09:29 | 04.03.2016 
Die Personenfreizügigkeit soll auf Kroatien ausgeweitet werden. Staatssekretär Mario Gattiker unterzeichnet heute Vormittag in Brüssel das entsprechende Zusatzprotokoll. Das bestätigte das Justiz- und Polizeidepartement (EJPD) am Freitag. 
Die Unterzeichnung war seit Annahme der Masseneinwanderungsinitiative am 9. Februar 2014 blockiert. Nun zeichnet sich bei deren Umsetzung eine Lösung ab, die Probleme bei der Personenfreizügigkeit können möglicherweise gelöst werden. Darum hat sich der Bundesrat entschieden, das Protokoll doch zu unterzeichnen.   
Er ist unter grossem Zeitdruck. Denn die Ausweitung der Personenfreizügigkeit auf Kroatien ist 2014 mit dem Forschungsabkommen Horizon 2020 verknüpft worden, das für die Schweizer Forschung von eminenter Bedeutung ist. Als provisorische Lösung handelte der Bundesrat damals einen teilweisen Anschluss aus.   
Der Schweiz winkt sogar die volle Assoziierung, jedoch nur, wenn das Kroatien-Protokoll bis am 9. Februar 2017 ratifiziert ist. Andernfalls fliegt die Schweiz definitiv aus der europäischen Forschungszusammenarbeit.   
Mit der Unterzeichnung am Freitag könnte der Ratifizierungsprozess aber noch gerade rechtzeitig abgeschlossen werden. Der Nationalrat will das Geschäft schon in der Sondersession im April behandeln. (SDA)

			Dear parents and tutors - a thread that I have thought about for a couple of years.    
I believe I am not the only one who prepares her kid at home, after work and school, in the program of her country of origin.    
She is scheduled to take the exams, follows the program at home with me, has her books and script writing-phonetics, etc.    
I take her to my old primary everytime I have to truck myself home for studies and family, and her adoptive teacher with the entire class have been very supportive and thrilled (there are more of these little travellers-kids, who spend some time abroad and some here with their grandparents). She also takes art classes out of school, takes photography, shoots and hikes with her uncles. Her level of mother tongue is native, a tiny accent. She plays with local kids after school and keeps a penfriend. Does recess sometimes and requested school lunches, too.      
Anyways - the work of the local teacher is amazing, she just did this with the class. She has 30 kids, they have 5 classes a day, no afternoon, go to theaters and school camps and are about a year ahead compared to the Swiss program (sci, history, math).       
The reasons I put my kid through this is (she actually considers it her own mission, I would prefer not to stress too much and maybe not go home so often, since it is tiring and I still have my own studies) - so she can communicate with her family, so she has the option to study at home, a degree in primary and secondary qualifies her for no exam entrance to a free specialized high school and so her schooling advances a little faster. They just memorize all in her Swiss program.  Another reason is so she forgets about being bullied in CH, the environment in home school is very accepting and helpful. She likes her individuality.       
Anyways - what are your experiences? Does the interest of your kids last? Did it pay off? Is it worth having your mother tongue supported? Do kids later on focus only on their Swiss program only as stuff gets more complicated? Do they come to see family on their own? What are the biggest obstacles - how do you nurture especially the mother tongue acquisition (movies, radio, playdates..)? Do kids see it as fun or work? Do they keep their mother tongue local buddies?   
My mother tongue is too difficult, by the way, to want to master it later on, it is difficult for kids as it is, impossible for grown ups, so I want her to have a headstart, just in case she is interested in something CH edu system does not offer. She is trilingual. My students in CH are tri-quadru lingual, too. I love that about Switzerland and consider it an amazing advantage. She just started German but refused to go with me to Dresden to practice (since apparently they do not speak the correct German there, yeah, her German teacher is Swiss German).     
What is the most tiring part for you--the tutor parent role mixing? The doubts if it even is worth all the effort?  I don't go over board, just kinda stand behind all this and organize things without showing her all of the effort and logistics, she takes it as her own thing to manage.    
Any stories to tell? Are there rewards for efforts any of you do...does your family understand and help? Do they think you are being too nostalgic? Am I just too protective of a tiny language that is dying out? Have you cut all ties with your home land and developed a way to network just here, in CH?

			Hi JayN,   
It is really tough making your decision when there is so much choice available and many parents I meet feel the same way.  The first thing I would say is there is no ""right answer"" when it comes to the best school.  The challenge is finding a school which works for your child, and gives them a love of learning that will hopefully carry on throughout their school life.   
The list of schools you have given are all very different from each other, so perhaps the first step is to make a short list and then visit the schools you feel fit best with your needs (if you haven't already).  I also agree with the posts that it would be a good idea to consider the local system too.  Non-native speaking children get lots of support and at such a young age immersion can be a really successful way of learning a new language.  It will help them/you have local friends and to integrate into your community.     
If you have already decided that you want an international school, language of instruction is often the most important factor.  ISL and GEMS are in English, with French taught alongside as a second language.  Haut Lac, Champettit and La Chat have instruction in both French and English.  The character of the schools are very different, along with their ethos and although on paper the language and curriculum seem really important often as a parent it is the intuitive feeling we get from visiting the school and talking to the head and teachers that makes our final decision.   
You did not mention Ecole Nouvelle de la Suisse Romande which is a bi-lingual school you may want to consider, with more emphasis on the French than the English.   
There are other smaller, local private schools you may want to consider depending on where you live.  A complete list can be found here:       
If you want to PM me with any specific qs I would be happy to help.   
Good luck in your search!

			We had the opposite - parents up in arms about various snacks not being permitted by the Kindergarten. Including bananas. Which is weird.   
I really don't find it matter much either way. My kids are all adults now, but when they were young, we didn't have sweets at home much, so they were a really treat. None of them have grown up to be sweet-a-holics. I think so long as you don't make a big fuss in front of them, they'll develop a balanced attitude towards sweets and the like.

			When I was learning English, my best strategy was to read a lot.    
I mostly read nonfiction and really got passionate about litterature. I only learned English when I was eleven and we certainly didn't speak it at home. It also helped that my mom got me hooked on Bertrand Russel and nonfiction.

			The school term finishes on Friday July 1st and school begins again on Monday August 15th in Neuchâtel this year. 
When your friend arrives and registers at the services des migrations they will assign a school to his son. Unless they arrive mid June he will start school before the summer holidays.   
There is no need for an additional paperwork with regards to schooling.   
There will be tests throughout the course if the year but there are no exams as such at that age.   
If your friend is happy to pay then there is the international Montessori in Neuchâtel which has a bilingual French/English programme. This is the only international option in Neuchâtel for a child of that age.   
Bear in mind that the school hours are quite irregular here so unless there is one parent at home at lunch and a couple of afternoons per week the friend will also need lunchtime and after school care for his son. 
The Catholic school near the Maladiere offers full days plus lunches etc and after school activities and as it is semi private you can go there wherever you live and there is no requirement to be Catholic. There are fees but it is much cheaper than the international school.

			Similar to above, our kids did the transition from bilingual Montessori to Sek A at the local school. The first 6 months is a fairly big learning curve - having to keep a work diary, know where they need to be and different things to remember each morning and afternoon...   
Do your kids already come home for lunch each day ? That was a learning-curve for them as well as they were used to an all-day programme with lunch provided. My son has a consistent starting time each morning, which was very different to my daughter whose schedule had different starting times on different days - I think that was harder for her partly because of this.   
There may be as step-up in terms of independence, but it's not as if the kids are not able to do things for themselves - you might need to analyse what the kids need and how to schedule their weekly routine as their needs change...   
Adolescence is likely a bigger hit than school... the brain switches off and the mouth switches on!   
They have to pretty much focus on everything they are doing, keep good track of their subjects and adapt to having multiple subjects with multiple teachers...    
I find the kids often have things they need for school (stationery etc, packed lunch if they are not coming home, specific clothing) and there is a balance between me keeping on top of them ""Is there anything you need for school"" and giving them money and telling them to go down the shops and sort it out for themselves!  They know our local shops and shopkeepers very well!   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2015	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Step up to Sek?

Why not allow access to the internet during exams? Calculators are allowed into some maths exams.    
If somebody can without wasting time do better work by using the internet, surely they will be a more useful employee, so it would be good if their grades showed what they can achieve on a daily basis.

			HI Mazza, We might be in the same situation. Moving from the French region to Zug/surrounding area. Our 10 yr old speaks fluent French & English but has had some issues at school. So switching to a bilingual English/German school could be too much right now. And I don't seem to find a French school option?? 
Maybe we try the International School of Zug & Luzern and add French as a second language? Let me know what you decide.

I assume that the 'play therapy' you are talking about is psyco-motor therapy. If so, it's very much the German version of OT, and it's unusal to get more than once a week. Instead, you need to get creative about other ways to allow her to get out and moving, as you can see she needs that (playgrounds, parks, swimming, playgyms)...    
I am a big fan of foundations for learning. They will definitely give you support in English, because that is why they exist in the first place.   
However, you do need to think long and hard about integration to the Swiss language and coping in the local school system... otherwise you really limit her social options and schooling... there is no reason why a child who speaks English at home cannot go to Swiss Kindergarten...plenty of kids do this...she may need a period of 1:1 to get up to speed, but kids learn fast, even kids with autism!   
You might also want to look at the bilingual school options as well. That way the english will be very supported, but the German will also be there...   
I know a child with Aspergers/Autism who speaks 4 languages. I also know a child who has a genetic condition similar to Down Syndrome who also has a diagnosis of dyslexia but is speaking 5 languages. There is no reason why they cannot be multilingual, despite their disabilities...and their intellect is not necessarily the key issue either...

			Hi,   
I have a five-year-old boy who is attending a local school in Geneva. He had some difficulties settling in and the Guidance Infantile (child psychology unit of the cantonal hospital) diagnosed him as having a mild autistic spectrum disorder. The school has been pretty supportive and, on the recommendation of his teacher, has put in a request for a teacher's aide to accompany him in the mornings.   
I had a group meeting with the teacher, the principal and his various therapists yesterday and the question was raised if there may be other ways of finding (and funding) someone to help him at school. So I wanted to put the following questions to the forum:   
(a) Does anyone know how long it would take for the cantonal authorities to process a request for a teacher's aide in a situation like this?   
(b) Does anyone know if social security (assurance invalidité) could cover the cost of a teaching aide at school, even if only partially?    
(c) Are there any other sources of funding that we could potentially tap into?   
I've also fired a message to ASK to see if they can help, but would be grateful for any advice that anyone on this forum can provide.   
Many thanks in advance.     
Best,

Im wondering if any of you have experience with a privately-run Krippe/Tagesmutter in Thalwil called Sonnenschein Kinderbetreung? The lady that runs it has space for my lg as of May, which is great because the Kitas in Thalwil have very long waiting periods. As a FTM, Im finding it hard to agree to leave my child with a stranger when I go back to work, so Id love to hear from anyone that has any experience with the CH lady that runs it.  
Thanks in advance

I'm sorry to hear your daughter is struggling.  I can't recommend any ""help"" in your area but I would say, in the first instance, it is surely the responsibility of your daughter's school - and especially her teachers - to support her in developing new strategies to managed her difficulty. Is there not an SEN (Special Educational Needs) department/section/person  - called a SENCO in the UK at least - in her school?  There should be differentiation and varied strategies employed for your daughter - and others who may also need an alternative approach and additional support.     
In my experience - and in my non-medical, non-expert opinion as someone who has successfully worked with/supported students with varying degrees of dyslexia - dyslexia is in no way a barrier to learning - it is, however, something that has to be supported/managed/lived with.  Many, many high achievers are dyslexic - a different brain chemistry/way of thinking can actually be conducive to excellence.       
If she's English -speaking (and reading) too, then I can recommend a (rather old now, but good) book called ""Toe By Toe"" which practices high frequency words and helps learners to recognise letter and word patterns with greater efficiency.  It does wonders for confidence building too as students can see the progress they are making.           
The book is by Keda and Harry Cowling and is available on Amazon so I imagine any decent bookstore armed with the ISBN can order it.  It's a system designed so that ""any literate person"" (their words) can support a user.  So it's ideal for parents who wish to support a child for instance.  It was used with a lot of success in my old school and I've used it when tutoring students with dyslexic tendencies or those diagnosed with dyslexia.     
Anyway - I hope this may help and I hope too that your daughter's school can provide more support for you both.     
Best,

You should also know that Greece would remain a valid and probably easy option is the child goes to school here. I've had friends in Greece that left the country for Germany or wherever during gymansio and they took the entry exams on different courses and requirements than the rest of us, and all the diaspora kids were fighting only themselves and not the 100,000 others for entries in their preferred unis. So people were getting in Athens Med much more easily than kids that were taking the ""normal"" panhellenics.   
So there's is always that option too.

			We are near Sion and the primary school my first year daughter goes to is great.  The classes are well equipped and this school has a Montessori approach.  I was very happy with the system.... something I would expect back home in Canada.  She knew French before starting so that helped a lot.  It is the teacher's main concern afterall.   In her class there are other English speaking kids as well so don't worry, it'll be great!

			Thanks a lot.  
Trollemor you said he had an adult with him at all times, do you mean there was a teacher who helped him during school time, how did it work? Or was it after regular class? 
My husband's company won't be paying the school...I have to consider that, It will cost us a lot, but we are willing to make an effort if that's gonna make a big difference on the treatment we're gonna get, he's gonna get, Another thing that worries me is he being hold back a year if he goes to swiss public school.  
Is that very common? Have a lot of people experienced that? I'm guessing the kid being hold back a year after their first years in Switzerland happens more often in the public system than in the private one? Is that correct?

			We also arrived from Australia in June but chose the public system in Zurich.  The children, 8 and 10 years old, were placed in an integration class at a public school about a km from home. The class has about 12 students and once they are proficient in German they move to their respective local public school. Depending on the child it takes between 6 and 12 months. All classes are taught in German and follow the local curriculum but the teachers are patient and the classes are small. The kids also pick up swiss German along the way when mixing with the other 'normal' classes and during breaks. It's been fantastic.

			I haven't studied in Switzerland... But in the UK I worked 80% whilst studying 100% and in 3rd year it nearly killed me. And I only managed it, because I had a job, which had quiet times where I could do my Uni work whilst I was at work.   
If I were you I'd get a job for weekends and holidays.. Leaving term time week days for uni & study. My uni had a habit of changing lecture days and times at the last moment which then clashed with my work shifts!

			Wonderful and very honest answers - thanks a lot for that!   
However, it's not solving completely my problems. Let me clarify:   
- we were living before in NEUCHATEL, my sons made 3 years in a private school and 3 years in a public one. At the time we were leaving Switzerland they were very good with French, as their whole education was in this language before (and bilingual in the private school). I have noticed a big difference between style of teaching in these both schools.   
- I am not thinking necessarily about British universities, but more about English as International way of communication: many high schools in Europe, Asia, Canada, not mentioning US and Australia, use it. I just think it opens much more doors. It is also possible than WE MIGHT BE SEND in the future by my husband's company somewhere else again - and there is much more schools with English than French. But we also might stay in CH - hm... forever? And pay for private education forever?! Oh, no! ;-)   
- last 3 years we've been living is Asia, where my boys are doing National Curriculum of England, CAMBRIDGE programme and going to have final exams this year (I hope good notes will be recognized by Swiss system). As far, they are going very well.   
- I know that it's not me choosing a lycee ;-), but I think if my boys go now to good schools it will help them later ""to be CHOSEN"" ;-) Living in NE  I could easily say which primary schools are good and which (and the same area of living) is better to avoid - which of course doesn't mean that every students from these schools have closed doors in their further education.   
- my boys in Neuchatel didn't have English at school, only GERMAN - but maybe because they were too young.   
- anyway, I have to start looking for an accommodation, end at least my younger son, which will be in ecole primare 7Harmos will have to be ACCEPTED in the nearest school (or I'm wrong?). Why not than to choose a good one? And what about the older one? (10Harmos)   
I'm wondering if it works if I send them for one year to a good, bilingual private school and later continue education in a public school? What do you think about it? 
- which private school would you than recommend? 
- still, which public schools would you recommend? 
- maybe I could/should contact a public institution responsible for education for advice?   
Kisses from Indonesia :-D

			If you want to compare end of high school diplomas, exams, abitur and other school leaving certificates, a good place is CRUS.....   
So the American high school diploma plus 5 AP's in certain subjects is taken to be equivalent to the Swiss 'maturite/matura'   
This is the US page     
and if you go back up you can find other countries requirements....   
If you want to get your diploma recognized by the Swiss so that there is an equivalency that employers would recognize, you have to go through this bureaucracy:       
I'm guessing the Associate degree doesn't have an equivalent but sbfi are the people to ask.

			Thank you so much for all the recommendations, they are extremely appreciated  and I will be looking into all of them.   
I figure both Swiss German and high German will be needed, so we will do both.  If kids all over the world learn English from tv, then if we only let our son watch tv in German he should pick up a lot.  Or at least it will make it easier on him when he arrives.     
I hadn't considered der Maus due to his age, but that is a good tip about toddlers liking it.  I'm sure my husband wouldn't mind watching it too.     
I will be looking into the movies, websites, YouTube channels, everything. Truly thank you.     
Except Pingu, they don't talk in that show, haha! Just my luck, the most  famous swiss toddler show has no talking.  Ha!

I think the main issue is some students feel entitled to outsourcing their assignments. They can afford it and it allows them to spend their time doing more fun stuff   They may or may not learn a lesson if they get caught but honesty is in my view something that you either learn early or never. 
On the other side, a person who learns to multitask college demands and builds up expertise in writing papers will have acquired a certain level of critical thinking skills an will likely be more employable than someone who delegates these tasks.

			As the first reply implied, the local school is much less of a factor in deciding where to live for most Swiss people.  
If you decide for local over the international schools, the big decision  is whether your kids should go to a Sek (equivalent to the old secondary modern) or to the Kanti (grammar school). There is the paradox that whilst everyone rightly praises the Swiss apprenticeship system, most parents are keen for their kids (approx 20% go) to go to Kanti as it offers the easiest way to university.  
In any case, first up will probably be a language course provided by the Kanton -you will need to contact them as to how this is arranged - I am sure there are others on the forum with direct experience from Luzern

			It really depends on how long you are planning to stay in Switzerland.  I've seen 11 year olds flounder under the pressure of learning another language and dealing with another culture while others have excelled.  If you are here for the short haul, send them to an international school.  If you see yourselves staying permanently, send them to a local school.     
It's a tough decision because you're playing with your children's education.     
Good luck.

It's very easy to end up in a situation where you have limited contact with the outside world. And in primary school, they don't offer a real full-time solution (unlike other private schools), as they don't have after school care on Wednesday afternoons or during the school vacation.   
Also, since the kids usually aren't there during the vacation, if you happen to stay in town it can get a bit lonely. And unless you're lucky enough to live right by your kids' best friends, you end up doing a lot of driving around. I've had my fair share of trips from Seefeld to Forch and Uster for playdates.

			If you want to maximize your chances bring one or two great recommendation letters and the GRE. But I would put much more emphasis on the recommendation letters.    
If you plan to take the GRE, make sure you have an almost 100% score on the quantitative part. I doubt their care about the verbal one.

			Dear English Forumers   
I am thinking of changing my son's current school (in Zurich) and moving to Kusnacht due to my job relocation. The school we are at is not that great or should I say that I am not that impressed with the teacher (only negative feedback is received, child sits alone as they work on integration, daily notes, weekly meetings, child beaten up, bullied, etc... - yet the child was a star pupil at the previous school). The last thing I wish for would be to find similar situation in another school and I rally wanted to ask other parents in Kusnacht if they have any experience with the current 1st grade teacher. Also is there an ex pat community attached to the school (integration if proving hard for the whole family). Any feedback much appreciated.    
Best

			Sorry, I didn't see the education group before I asked this question in Daily Life.   
i'm applying to both HEAD and ECAL this winter for fine arts/photography bachelor. ECAL is my number one school because they have a specific photo program, though I get the impression it is a bit harder to get into. HEAD is clearly also a great school. Does anyone have experience in either of these two schools? To be honest, I don't get a good idea on either website nor after speaking with both schools' secretaries of how to best prepare for the entrance exam/interview. Tips would be much appreciated because in the states, this process is very different.   
Thanks in advance

			Hi everyone,   
I'm 16 and in my last year of the Dutch Gymnasium, which is the highest level of secondary school education and I want to study at ETH Zurich. Starting in 2017, since I am taking a gap year working (to be able to pay tuition  ) and studying. I want to study 'umweltnaturwissenschaften'. (environmental sciences)   
I think my German is good enough and am getting my TestDaf this summer. I am finishing secondary school a year sooner because I skipped a year in primary school (but a friend who used to live in Switzerland said that they don't see that as a good thing?) and I have a volunteer job in environmental protection. My grades are good (but not perfect) and I have the right subjects but for some reasons it seems unlikely to me that they'll want me  ... since it's such a world-class university.   
So are there any Dutchies who study at/ have studied at ETH (Or just anyone who know more than I do) and what grades did you have that got you in?  It only says I need 70% in general/on individual subjects on my final exams. So do they mean a 7 out of 10? Or 70 % correct? Because that's not the same in NL    
Also does anyone know general admission statistics? Because I haven't seen them on the website like with all the anglosaxon universities.    
Thanks in advance.

			French citizens and citizens of other francophone countries have been eligible for Quebec in-province tuition for studies at Quebec universities, including English-speaking McGill and Concordia. The tuition for these eligible non-Canadian citizens was increased this fall so that they now pay out-of-province tuition but which is still lower than international student tuition.    
CBC wrote this in February 2015: ""  ""

			Dear Parrot, 
1st of all, where about in Schwyz are you planning to move to? The canton of Schwyz in particular can be anything from very rural with few options available for pre-Kindergarten children in the inner-Schwyz parts to a number of choices (although expensive) in so called 'Ausser Schwyz' at or by the lake Zurich.  
In any case, any pre-Kindergarten care options are private (unless you go for 1-2x week 3 hours at a playgroup organised by the community (Spielgruppe)). Otherwise you are looking at something around CHF 150 per day-for bilingual pre-school care this could be even more.  
Once they are 4 (in the canton Schwyz 4 by the 31st of July), they may enter free Kindergarten, but this is usually only four mornings in the first year and 4-5 mornings and 1 afternoon in the second year (note that children come home for lunch break). 
2.) This depends on the length of your stay. Unless you are planning to just have a short stay followed by a relocation to an English speaking country, a local (i.e. Swiss-German) creche is the best way to get her quickly immersed into the local language and that is a real bonus if you are staying here for longer

			In some ways it is probably easier on children to do the move now rather than thirty years ago. The English school our childen went to had, if I remember correctly, only one other child who was not English. When we came back, the children attended a village school where 'abroad' or 'foreign' was the next village down the valley. This meant, in both cases, that the teaching staff were not really accustomed to children who, though intelligent and quick to pick things up, had 'holes' in their knowledge. On the plus side, it had the advantage that our youngsters heard English (and German) as spoken by native speakers and didn't pick up grammatical mistakes from others whose language was not perfect.    
If we were to put the clock back, with our present knowledge of the ups and downs, we would definitely do the same thing again.

			I just read it, it gives a good introduction to the system as well as advice on how to communicate and interact with the school. The author is very open about the fact that the system is constantly changing and that doing her research is like trying to shoot 26 moving targets. That alone was an eye opener for us. Now we feel ready to switch from bilingual private school to public school, but we have to think carefully about where we will move before we do the switch.

			Hi there 
In the greater Zurich area teachers and principals are used to get in touch with Kids from abroad. So, don't worry about your Kids! They will be fine.   
In the City of Zurich, parents of children reaching the age of 4 will automatically receive the registration form for the kindergarten. Kindergarten is in your local zone and the local authority decides which kindergarten your child will attend.  
After Kindergarten there is a ""Mittagshort"" for lunch or a ""Mittag/Abendhort"" for afternoons (11.55 till 6 pm).

			university of italian switzerland needs more funding so fees are higher for everyone, it's double for foreigners but that's because 50% of the students are italian especially in some faculties and thus don't have an interest in attracting even more, it's to quell the numbers and get something out of it i guess. Italian students with relatively rich families would pay up to 3000€ in italy anyway.

			Hi Dechen01   
The bachelor program in design management is developing students to pick up a large variety of jobs: there are alumni working in design agencies as project managers, strategists or client representatives / account managers; as product managers in service or product companies; as internal consultants in marketing, branding or product development.    
With industries moving to service providers and an increased need to manage design and branding properly, the outlook for lasting career opportunities is very good: in the end its up to the individual to make most out of an education   But the program is a solid fundament for a career, ideal to pick up an interesting job, or as a starting point for further education towards more a specialized field, like brand management, design ethnography or strategic design.     
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.   
Best regards, 
Chantal from Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU)

We also considered d'Insle, and people we know who have kids there are very satisfied. The reason why we chose Sprungbrett instead is that they have French at Kindergarten level, which d'Insle doesn't have. They do offer French from primary school, though.    
We didn't know anything about Montessori before switching, I have to say that I am completely sold by now, seeing how the Troll has developed since changing school in May 2014.

			Thank you runningdear.   
BLP,  the great thing is that as my boyfriend will be working online,  this opens up alot of opportunity for me location wise. All he needs is a strong Internet connection! As we have no car, I figure it would probably better to be centrally located, ideally in one of the bigger cities... As I say,  I'm very open to location as long as we have good Internet and public transport options.

			One more question, I would like to go back to the original matter, the competitiveness to get accepted in a PhD program in ETHZ. Someone has said above that, many consider it competitive because there are typically more than one applicants with matching criteria to the position. Well, since the application period is technically open all throughout the year, it may happen that one applies at certain time where there are no other applicants applying at around the same time. If this one applicant is considered ideal by the prof, he is technically accepted without any competition right?

			This depends where you study and at what level you study.   
In my experience you can do a masters degree more or less in english at a university or federal school without big problems, especially at ETH.   
At bachelors level I think it will be a lot harder to find courses purely in english.    
As others have pointed out, for employability later it will be a huge plus to speak the local language. Especially if you are going for higher-paying jobs.   
I would avoid the USI except for very specialised masters programs, when I was a student this was the last resort for people who failed elsewhere. I would not even consider private universities, they don't have ""worse"" reputations but zero reputation.

			Well, all of the PhD positions   at ETH are funded positions (see  ). You can find the salaries  . Normally, this means you will have to be teaching assistant (help with labs, correct exercises, etc.) or work on a predefined project that the professor has in mind. The salaries mentioned there are for 100% position, when looking to an advertised position, make sure to check if it's 60%, 80%, etc. and adjust accordingly.   
However, if you approach a professor and ask to do a PhD without him/her advertising the position, then he is not obliged to offer you any money (although if you are good and he has some funding, he/she  ).   
Some people do their PhD through their company and thus get paid externally. Other people come with a scholarship from their home country, or even have money from their family (rarely though).   
Funded PhD positions are of course   more competitive to get. And it would help if you did for example your master thesis at ETHZ so that the professor knows who you are.   
The salary is one of the best you can get as a PhD student anywhere in the world (first year, net ~3300 CHFs, then it goes up a bit). All the PhD students I have met actually save money from their salary. If you share a flat, the rent shouldn't be more that 700-800 CHFs (including internet, heating, etc.). You can get a cheap health insurance for 80-90 CHFs per month (swisscare). For 100 CHFs  , you can register to the sports facilities with hundreds of group courses, gym, swimming pool, etc. You get a lot of discounts everywhere (e.g. a full meal at the uni restaurant costs 5.40 CHFs for students and it's good quality).   
So, if you get an offer to do a PhD at ETHZ, go for it. Whether you really want to do a PhD altogether, what extra benefits you will get in your future employment, etc., etc., it's another issue...   
P.S.: I am a postdoc at ETHZ.

			Totallay agree with the points made by DB above. I'd add that class size would also make a big difference- here in my part of Switzerland, class size is 15 to 17 max- so the teacher has much more time for individuals too (I taught classes of 33 in the UK).

I researched some of these questions with regard to our kids studying in NZ. 
I think: 
 to qualify as a home student you will have to have been resident in Oz for a year. 
each uni or college will judge your qualifications individually (possibly state wise)  -you have the problem that the KV is probably a higher  academic standard than an Australian apprenticeship - you might have to do a preliminary course or take an Australian exam. 
In any case it is worth contacting future places of study as early as possible 
Good luck

For  the assignment is in accordance with the 4-stage model according to the  guidelines and principles proceed from 24 March 1997th At Level 3, the child must be registered with the competent teacher of special education for specialist assessment. This can be done either directly or through the competent school management. Drag  the class teacher and the teacher for special education allocation for a  special instruction into consideration, so they sign the child to the  competent educational counselling centre or at another expert body for  evaluation. Given the consent of the parents is mandatory. The  expert body shall examine the documents, makes most independent  investigations and proposes the School Board on assignment to special  education. Depending on the region, the assignment can also be done via an assessment and assignment to special education conference. Speciality Classes are usually held as group classes and is limited in time.

Zuweisung zum Spezialunterricht 
Im Rahmen der Volksschule wird folgender Spezialunterricht angeboten: Ambulante heilpädagogische Betreuung (AHP), Spezialunterricht für Kinder mit Lese- oder Rechtschreibstörungen sowie mit Rechenstörungen (Legasthenie/Dyskalkulie), Logopädie und Psychomotorik. Für die Zuweisung ist gemäss dem 4-Stufen-Modell nach den Richtlinien und Grundsätzen vom 24. März 1997 vorzugehen. Auf Stufe 3 sind die Kinder bei der zuständigen Lehrperson für Spezialunterricht zur fachspezifischen Beurteilung anzumelden. Dies kann direkt oder über die zuständige Schulleitung geschehen. Ziehen die Klassenlehrperson und die Lehrperson für Spezialunterricht eine Zuweisung zum Spezialunterricht in Betracht, so melden sie das Kind bei der zuständigen Erziehungsberatungsstelle oder bei einer anderen Fachinstanz zur Beurteilung an. Dazu ist die Einwilligung der Eltern zwingend erforderlich. Die Fachinstanz prüft die Unterlagen, macht allenfalls selbstständige Abklärungen und stellt der Schulkommission Antrag auf Zuweisung zum Spezialunterricht. Je nach Region kann die Zuweisung zum Spezialunterricht auch via eine Beurteilungs- und Zuweisungskonferenz erfolgen. Der Spezialunterricht findet in der Regel als Gruppenunterricht statt und ist zeitlich beschränkt. Einzelunterricht ist durch die Antrag stellende Instanz zu begründen.

We put them into Swiss schools and I do feel like we made the right decision for us, and how we have chosen to integrate into Swiss life (I can't say if it would be the right decision for everyone, but certainly for us)   
One of the biggest challenges was language. We only found out we were moving to Switzerland with 2 months' notice, none of us spoke a word of German. The fact that Swiss speak German in dialect does compound this! It does seem a huge big deal at first but I have been surprised by how we've been getting along with this challenge. The other challenges were just getting used to the system and the culture, it's so different here to the UK. The curriculum, the age groups, the way the lessons are conducted, the timetables, the way the children interact with each other and with the teachers, the lack of security gates and sign-in forms and kids walking on their own and all that. It just takes some getting used to but if you breathe in to it, you'll be good      
I had the same concerns as you about them fitting in and making friends. While I can reassure you that now they are thriving, I have to say at first they found it difficult and we had to put some work in to assist them in integrating, the pinnacle apparently being arranging a halloween party 3-4 months after the eldest had started school; it may or may not have been coincidental but there was a definite turning point from then.

			At the university st gallen you can study in english from bachelor level I think, it can lead you to the master in strategy and international management, which is one of the best in the world, if you want to try the best of the best this is the one to go for, in any case there are other masters in the business and economics area and st gallen is considered the best in switzerland, not everything is offered in english though so you might have to learn german anyway. 
In swiss universities english-only courses are found mostly at master level, not bachelor sadly. The links provided by 7070 are universities of applied sciences which i guess took this opportunity and offer english-only courses,  they are considered equivalent by law but not as prestigious, cannot award PhDs, and are dislocated in more provincial cities, after a bachelor in one of those you can also continue with an english-language master in an academic university i think.

My son (4 years old) goes to a Montessori in Meggen. 
Since a few kids moved on to a Primary school there are places available for new kids to come (probably could start immediately), so I thought I'd spread the word a little ))   
We are very happy with this place. The teacher is very experienced in the Montessori method and she does an amazing job.   
Some facts: 
The place is for kids between 2,5 and 6 years old. 
Bilingual (English and German) 
It is in Meggen (cant. Lucerne) that could be convenient also for people living in Kuessnacht a.R. or even Rotkreuz).

			I just wanted folks to know that our kids decided to try out the new Democratic School ( ) in Bottmingen. So far, they like it pretty well, although it is new, so still small. If anyone wants to discuss democratic education in general or this school in particular, I'd be happy to talk more. (  is a pretty good article about the school my brother attended outside of Boston, where my kids plan to attend if and when we return to the US.)

			Dear All, I saw this post and instead of posting another thread I just wanted to ask here if anyone can suggest an executive MBA in Zurich, which I can attend during weekends. And I think since its weekends, I can travel up to 1/1,5 hrs to  cities around as well. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks

			St Sulpice is a nice and friendly place to live. close to the lake and most tax friendly commune in Vaud. Walking distance from EPFL and UNIL. This whole area is quite international. The commune is very quiet and not a lot of communal life. I see it as a village for pensioners...     
I find it a bit squeezed between the autoroute and the lake but it is on the Geneva side of Lausanne if connections are important to you. On making a choice I would also look at the other side of Lausanne (north or west)

			Lucky us having got our childrens' schooling finished before the rules became quite so strict. Or perhaps the rules were there before, but pre-Internet, pre-Mobile Phones, pre-Facebook, pre-Twitter etc. anyone getting special permission to take their children out of school didn't shout it from the rooftops and encourage others to do the same.  
Shortly before we moved to England, we took our children out of their primary classes on a Saturday (in those days Saturday morning was still school) just to have a wonderful day skiing before we left! And while in England, we brought them over here for nothing more important than a week's skiing holiday and this with the blessing of their teachers.  
Times change.  
I think with more and more 'foreign' children in the schools they probably had to tighten up or everyone would be taking an extra week to travel to their 'homeland' for weddings of second cousins twice removed.

			Good day everyone   
Does anyone know of a Montessori training course offered in the Canton Vaud area. 
Also, if I enrolled on the course as an EU citizen, will I have any issues obtaining a permit?  
What permit would they issue me with? 
Would my non EU spouse be allowed to accompany me into the country and look for work?   
Any info would be greatly appreciated as I am totally confused about all the permits available in Switzerland!!!!

			It depends a lot on your grades. If you think your grades are good (top 10% in your class) and has a decent GRE score, good references etc, you stand a chance. It's quite competitive to get in, but Robotics program has large intake, so I'd say there is a better chance compared to other programs.

			If you look at University courses you can study English Lit, or American Lit (or both).   
The GCSE course is called English Lit. could you argue that To Kill a Mockingbird is not English Lit? (discuss).   
Regardless, I studied TKAM at school 18 years ago, I think it's about time for a change even if only for the teachers sake.

			Hello!    
I'm a Building Science student from New Zealand and I was looking at opportunities for a Masters Degree in a similar field and came across the ETH Zurich DARCH Master in Building Integrated Systems.  
I was wondering if anyone has applied to it before (accepted/rejected doesn't matter) or for Architecture or similar field? If you have, what did you do? What would you have done to improve your application? 
What makes you a desirable applicant? What GPA should I be aiming for and whether this should be calculated from all of my grades or if it's the last 2 years (I'm currently sitting on an A- but I still have 1.5 years to go)? Do I need to sit GRE tests (I don't know if we have any places to sit that in New Zealand). Should I be getting a years worth of work experience or should I apply immediately after completing my bachelors?   
Thanks, 
A confused student trying to find some motivation for my future

			We're a Swiss family who have been living in Australia for the past 10 years. My family is from Zug but I grew up in Australia and then lived for 12 years in Luzern. My husband is from Lausanne. We plan to move back to Switzerland in 2 years and have chosen Biel/Bienne due to the bilingualism. Our children are fluent in French. I am going to Biel/Bienne in a few months and would like to visit some potential public schools while there. Our children will be aged 15, 13, 11 and 9 when we move. Could somebody please give me suggestions about schools in the city? Is schooling taught in French or German depending on the area or are all schools bilingual? We hope to make the transition for our kids as smooth as possible and have everything in place before the move.

			I am not familiar with private schools but this is the website for public schools in Zurich:   
8048 is in Schulkreis ""Letzi"". You will not have a choice of schools if choosing public schools, but will be allocated based on your address. So it makes sense to find accommodation first. Look at   for accommodation.

I have just arrived in Bern (from South Africa) to live with my partner, and am investigating undertaking my PhD with a Swiss University in physical geography (I also have a Swiss passport). 
My areas of research interest are: mining, mine closure, sustainability, pedagogy of geography, soil erosion, GIS and remote sensing, as well as disaster management and prediction. 
Can anyone recommend a particular University or even a particular professor as a potential supervisor?   
Any advice is most appreciated!

			You MIGHT have some luck checking with music teachers at the local OR international schools. I know the music teacher at my son's school offered private violin lessons at one point. (Unsure if there are still openings) I know that he played piano as well but am unsure if he offered lessons for that instrument.   
Even if they don't have openings they may have contact info for you of friends or a colleague who can help you out.

			Hi Lorraine, I am currently studying to get my BA in Primary education and teaching at a local school part time. The need for qualified special needs teachers is huge, however the education is vey different from Canada. Special needs education is a masters degree here, usually in addition to a BA in teaching.  Schools are having difficulties filling their special needs teaching vacancies, and many hire staff that are not yet finished with their qualifications. You'd have to contact each university for more information, or contact international schools directly.         
The body that would recognize your Canadian qualifications is the EDK.  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jun 2015	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Need for special needs assisting in CH?	"""LorraineEA"	Posts: 10	1,559	10	Education

			If you have anyone in the US or Canada, you could ask them to order for you and send them here. Even better if you know school-age kids, because they get the monthly flyers to order books from at a discount, many in paperback => lots more books to to fit in a package.

			Hi Thread, I am currently finishing my Bachelor studies of International Management at ABMS Switzerland. It was my first time to experience online education and I can say its been a positive one. The whole team is great and supportive and flexible studying program allows you to be committed to other things beside your studies, but still getting adequate knowledge. Of course, big adventage is Swiss qualification and with ABMS degree I'm qualified to work in Switzerland.  
Hope this helps   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Mar 2015	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	I would like  to know  any experience with the  ABMS university   or  OU	"""yvl"	Posts: 1	1,667	2	Education

			For most subjects there are no fixed textbooks in switzerland (and the few that are mandated at cantonal level are usually just to put money in some people's' pockets, exactly like in other countries). 
We in ticino sometimes used foreign textbooks, from italy mostly (we had books for derivatives and integral in math, non-swiss history, organic chemistry, literature), at teacher's discretion, this just to say that switzerland is a very small market, with cantons having different studies and curriculums, and because of that it doesn't have its own books unless absolutely necessary (swiss history, the famous ""libro rosso"", you should get the french version of that, and the infamous formulaires et tables   that was the only one admitted at exams, by the way I see they also publish a book for first year   maybe you can check it out). 
On those links someone else provided you can find all the topics you need to study, since the federal exam is disconnected from local teachers you can probably study in general course books. You could try to gain access to somebody's recent high school material too, or even ask teachers (but you might have to work on them). 
I would gather all the topics of each subject that you need to study, gather all the material you can find, make a list of books and start with first year of all subjects so not to go crazy, don't buy all books at once imho, really try to get high school material and used books maybe put an ad on anibis or go hunt some freshly maturated high school students, go put ads in schools before they do the exams maybe they read it, I still have high school books i can't get rid of (but they're in italian), use the public libraries I don't know if you can gain access to the high school ones too maybe they have these books and you can go the ""indian way"". 
Btw self-schooling takes a lot of self-discipline, especially math, if you can do it, chapeau!

			Went through a similar situation and I did the following:   
- stopped teaching my son reading and writing (he was 5 year old when he started kinski in August 2014), and let him focus on learning German 
- arranged playdates with the Swiss neighbours, who were younger than him - he hesitated talking in Swiss German to the kids of his class, as he was too self-conscious, but felt he could communicate with smaller kids. After all, they also spoke ""funny"" too, and they did not laugh at him when he made mistakes.** 
- bought a Ting smart pen, with the accompanying German books.  Every day, he had to sit with the book for some 10 mins, in between playing with Lego and Thomas the train engine. 
- When I started learning German, I'd say a few sentences in German, and let him comment on it.  Too often, I was told that I did not know how to speak German!   
Good luck!     
** This I know with hindsight. I did not know that this will happen, but now I can put one and one together.

			Tuborg, 
you are right in saying that not all children will get there, I guess I was referring to children from a more or less privileged background, who get all the necessary support but still develop at their own pace...These children are sometimes quickly classed as 'difficult' or 'behind' by some teachers but just need more time

			Exactly Meloncollie- take the gender out. The assumption from the OP. that women should not be educated (I know, tongue and cheek) as they have to look after kids- is really really sexist in itself, no?   
ACE1- the UK didn't take over child care because it was more enlightened, but because women had to go to work to replace the men at war. Thos K/Cantons that have approved the Harmos (from harmonising of course) system now all have blocked timetables for primary school, or are well on the way of implementation. But several Kantons refused- and if both parents work, perhaps best not to choose to live there.   
The Head of Educ here is a single mum and lawyer- and worked hard to ensure proper before and after school + lunch provision is provided FOR THOS WHO WANT IT - but your solution ' to force children' to eat at school, is just as bad as 'forcing them to go home'. Rightly or wrongly (and perhaps listening to Jamie Oliver on school meals and obesity makes sense here) most parents in rural areas still prefer to eat together at lunch-time,  at the table- and they should have the right to do so. More flexibility of patterns is what is required, not reverse 'dictatorship'. Parents prefer to eat together at lunch-time thus releasing the after school and evenings for clubs, sport and other activities- fair enough and each to their own.   
I know 3 women who used to be men- but somehow none of them have had children so far, surprise. One of them has, actually, but his wife had them when she was married and was a he.

			That's a very good post, Cactina. And you're spot on here    Indeed, there's something about Switzerland/Swiss German side that hot-blooded people (Latin types) we'll find difficult to adapt to (lack of spontaneity, intellectual effervescence...in other words a specific atmosphere). The best approach is to try finding like-minded people and make a good group of friends. Travelling and/or working in a job that requires travelling can help...a lot.  
I would say Switzerland can be a good experience if you hang around with the right kind of people.

The concert was great and the post concert nibbles and drinks with other folk (I assume parents and guests from the school) was very convivial. We have an 11 year old daughter (eldest starting university shortly) and would want to delve a bit deeper into what La Cote has to offer.

			Hi there.    
As I understand it the Nord Anglia Education Group (41 schools globally?) have linked up with Juilliard School in New York to provide a partnership that will allow students to study and receive tuition across the performing Arts (Music, dance and Theatre). The lead on from this is that students from Nord Anglia Schools could move on to study at Juilliard post school.   
La Cote International School in Aubonne are one of the leaders in this partnership as I understand it and have already hosted a couple of concerts (Music, singing  and dance). The idea is to roll out the tuition and guidance from Juilliard throughout the school performing arts curriculum in some way.  I think they are also looking to develop their Design education too (Product and Industrial design).    
My wife and I attended a concert there on Thursday (Medair charity) where a stunning internationally renowned 18 year old Spanish pianist (Alice Burla) performed and the school choir sang. Impressive if rather hot evening!

			Be aware the holiday schedule is really very different between the international schools and the local Swiss schools. This may affect your decision about they will both go into the same system. 
We have done both. There are pros and cons to both. For your 11 year old if it was my child and money was not an issue I would go for the International system. But I have known of children going into the Swiss system and doing well. They will have to work a lot harder than the local kids and you will need to be quite involved to ensure they get they help they need and they are doing all the work they are expected to do.

			No idea - used to see dealers every day when the little ones went to Ecole de Centre Ville, as they would hang out by the Promenade d'Italie. It took a big public campaign to move them on from there (Nyon even borrowed a drugs dog from Lausanne, or so I heard). They must've gone somewhere, as there was clearly a thriving market - I'd guess near the station/gymi, but don't know for sure...

I might be able to give you some information based on my experience some years ago: I have been told that MSc MTEC is very desirable and therefore competitive, so having to wait might not be a very good sign, as many spots have already been filled. 
But in general, everyone agrees that applying in the first session (until mid-December) is easier.

			Threads like this might help you-       
But I wholly support the suggestion of having a full examination by the pediatirician as a first step.  You really should rule out anything medical initially, and the pediatrician is your ally for the school and any other special therapies.  I have started there, and been referred for hearing tests, eye tests, and many other specialists, and eventually therapists for my special needs child.

			Oh, yes, and I've also heard of the model of paying some portion to the child and some portion of the wage to the parents, by full [written] agreement with parents and child, and the parents saves that money up for something particular that the child wants or needs.  Some families are wealthy enough for the child just be allowed to spend the money, but others may be happy if the child is working towards the price of his/her bicycle, or the cost of the school ski trip, etc.

			Hi everyone,   
I live with my family (my wife and our little son) in Kleinbasel. We enjoy living in the area, as it is close to the city center and shops are nearby us. 
Our son is 3 and half years old and therefore we start looking carefully for a kindergarten/school for him. We come from Italy and therefore have a strong public school orientation. 
Unfortunately a person we know has reported us a very bad reputation of the school where our son could go, the Bläsi.  
Main reasons are related with the fact that pupils are really energics/chaotics and that the level of German children learn, due to the high immigrant tax, is very bad. 
Coming from Italy, we don't see such a chaos when enjoing the playground in fron of the school, therefore we would expect same level (or better) in the school. In regards of the German, I guess that the very high immigrant tax must have an effect on how people speak during the day. 
Does anybody have a direct experience with the school and/or can suggest a person we can talk with to understand more about this topic? 
Thank you all for your help!

			Astrophysics is not a field with a lot of positions, because it does not have practical applications. As such it is excessively competitive and I would not recommend anyone take that career path. I have many peers in the field, and all I see from them is frustration. When you have a super-academic field like that, you have to be both lucky and good, and you have to jump through all the hoops starting from 18. Sorry but I think it's too late for you for astrophysics.   
You say you are not good at maths.  Hmm... well this may be more or less meaningless, because maths and physics theory courses have nothing to do with how these things are done now. Analytical work is basically dead, almost all theory is done with simulations on a computer.  In simulation the goal is basically break the problem down into its simplest hunk and then replicate that little pixel/voxel/whatever many, many times.     
A better question is, how is your programming?  There are two groups of people in the hard sciences now-a-days, tool builders (90 % software, 10 % hardware), and tool users. The users work for the builder group. Sometimes the users get professor positions but not so often.   
In Switzerland, undergraduate studies are in German or French, grad studies are in English. So you would want to avoid undergraduate studies  which means you would have to transition directly into a graduate program. North America may be a better option. They are generally better at dealing with immigrants.     
The key for you to get into graduate studies would be to find an appropriate professor-type to sponsor your application. If someone wants you has a graduate student, all credentialism related problems can be made to go away with special exemptions. Trust me, anyone who has taught at a university level knows that grades have little correlation with the type of creative intelligence needed to succeed as a researcher.    
Principle investigators do get fairly large volumes of unsolicited emails, so I always recommend trying to approach them in person.  Do you live near a decent university in Norway? Do the departments run seminar you can go to every week? This is a potential way to get face recognition so that you can visit their offices. Norway has lots of money for students and a shortage of Norwegians to fill them, from what I know of the situation there.

			Hi, 
Mine have been in the public school system for about 7 months. I agree with all the posts. My experience here has shown me although high German is the language of instruction, Swiss German is how they make friends. It's what is spoken in the playground. Mine start french in 3rd grade but we are in basell and. English starts in the 5th grade. 
The kids in their class ( year 1 and 2) here are now fluent enough and kind enough to speak with mine in high German but mine are also picking up Swiss German. It might be a difficult time in the beginning for them but it will get better. trying to Speak the local language has made us fit in and part of the community. I have found swiss families admire those who try to learn the dialect and in turn they give us free access to their kids for play dates.. It is hard to watch their struggle in the beginning  but watching their success has given me a real confidence that they can cope with change and are resilient. Given your kids have already learnt french they may not struggle much at all learning another language. My swiss husband tells me half of the eu is trying to learn German because of the economy and job prospects compared to Greece, Spain, Portugal etc.

			For a list with open positions your child should contact the nearest Office d'Orientation.   
Normally you apply before November, get a contract around November, and trainings starts mid August(Normal school year start). It is possible that some spots are still open after November, but only a few. Some of this positions may be for artisan professions that are not really liked by the younger people but are actually highly worthwhile for the one with the right skills.

			Bachelors courses here are taught in a Swiss language so German if you're applying to Bern uni.  Many Masters are taught in English though so that might be the way to go.  However, you would need your current Chemistry Bachelors degree to be recognised before you could be accepted.

			What you are specifically interested in comparing is an MA/MSc with an MBA, rather than with the CAS, DAS, MAS courses. One big difference from the learning perspective is that a lot of MSc students are in their early 20s and have come straight from their bachelors (hence the ""consecutive"" degree that costs very little in Switzerland) while MBA students may be in their 30s and as well as having more money  , often have a business network and a lot of work/management experience that others can learn from.

Hopefully the problems to which you are referring are about admissions? We've already spoken with representatives at five universities about financial aid and admissions (that was one of my first worries when this transfer was offered). For two of the private universities, he'll be treated as an international applicant and compared to others who are applying from Switzerland. For another one he's considered a US applicant. We know that he'll still be treated as an in-state attendee if he chooses a state school because we are living in Switzerland for an employment assignment, but still claim domicile in Texas (every state is different...this is the rule in Texas...nothing to do with state taxes as others have written in other threads on EF as there is no state tax here). He is still eligible for financial aid at any state-supported school in the US, both need-based and merit-based. Let me know if you see a different problem as I'm still overwhelmed with our move and can't think of everything.   
It would be nice for him to be more of a part of the community...we really want him to experience a different culture in its entirety, but maybe the foreign language classes in Switzerland are better than where we are? I can't imagine him taking calculus, organic chemistry, or an advanced literature class in French. He's at the end of the first year and the class is working on the difference between  ,  ,  , and  ...

			Hi, I moved to Switzerland due to my marriage. 
I had a specialized job back in my country, but this job is almost impossible to find in Switzerland. A certificate is also required.   
Since I was always focused on my field, I have no experience in marketing, accounting, IT, etc which are the mainstream jobs in this country.   
Did anyone have a similar issue? 
If so, what did you do to make the first step, for example, starting further education or training?

Climbing up a career ladder took our family through many moves (not unique on the EF) and short of not having to move so many times, the only thing that eased the going, certainly from a financial p.o.v. was getting on an international contract that covered a certain percentage of school fees and extra tuition as needed. Our daughter is extremely dyslexic and dyscalculic - we could never have afforded the extra help she has received (beyond what school provided - already quite a lot) if OH's employer had not cost-shared. I couldn't honestly say I don't think the number of relocations had a negative impact on her overall confidence, academic progress, etc, where as her younger brother, who is standard-issue with no extra ""special learning features"" has more-or-less bounced through it all and come out smiling (most days ) All financial help ended when OH left the MNC after 16 years for an academic position in CH...   
Aside from the two of you as parents discussing the possible impact this (and future) moves may have on the longterm wellbeing of your 5-yr old, is there no chance your OH could try to negotiate a) continuation of an international contract, alternatively b) compensation that covers school fees if you decided private is your choice?   
I wish you luck, and the ability to retain a discreet sense-of-humour, in the coming months.

			Do you think we do not understand? We are all foreigners and have all lived abroad- so we all know it is not easy... believe me. I looked after my elderly parents for 20+ years from abroad, having to take time off, again and again, and jump on a plane as I was told it was the end, again and again- whilst trying to hold a senior job and bringing up teenagers. I had to give up my senior post in the end, and finally give up work altogether to cope. So believe me... I know. We all know here on EF.   
You could go for 9 days and only miss 3 days off school- which would be totally acceptable in the circumstances. But splitting it over 2 weeks may just be too much and affect other issues. It may, it may not- none of us can know. Good luck.

			Hello. You might want to purchase the book, ""Going Local, Your Guide to Swiss Schooling,"" by Margaret Oertig. Here's the link:     
It has a massive amount of information, much of which you won't need for your one year, but it also has a lot of reports on expats' experiences with state schools in Switzerland that would help you prepare to get the most for your kids during your year, and perhaps avoid some pitfalls. It really supports, or even advocates, entering your kids in state schools here when feasible for a family's circumstances, without in any way judging those families who choose international schools (and, indeed, noting the different advantages of the international route).    
I truly understand and respect your desire for your children to really learn French (I hope you have them in classes now because every bit of French they can learn beforehand will really, really help them get a good start here) and really experience local living while you are here. And I can tell that you don't want to hear anything more about private schools, so I will bite my tongue! And, again, I really respect your determination. But consider one other factor that could affect your kids' experience here and whether they get out of it what you are hoping. Switzerland culturally is NOT France. For a lighthearted, easy-read, tongue-in-cheek look at the Swiss culture, you might read the the Xenophobe's Guide to Switzerland (and the Xenophobe's Guide to France for comparison). It will be really important for you to come to Switzerland prepared for the culture since you won't have the luxury of learning by trial and error over time.    
The Going Local book has some blurbs from English-speaking kids who have started in Swiss state primary school. Some found it difficult to break in socially because, apparently, in many cases friendships form in enfantine/kindergarten/1H-2H, and classes tend to stay together and form fairly tight-knit groups. My kids aren't old enough for me to know from first-hand experience, but social reserve and slowly-developed, long-term friendship is certainly a recurring theme in observations about the Swiss. If your kids can't make friends, they may not learn French very well (a lot of language learning happens, of course, when they make friends), or enjoy the experience at all. Maybe you would still have been glad of your experience in France even if you had been unable to make friends....or maybe that would have altered your entire outlook toward French and language-learning.   
Anyway, just keep in mind these challenges that you will need to overcome for your kids to make friends and learn French and have fun:    
1. the state schools in Fribourg are big, and some of the schools are considered rough (by the Swiss, tho, I am not at all sure that an American would see them as rough) and can be intimidating (Vignettaz less so). Can you make a visit to check out the area and see the schools?    
2. there are no school sports-teams (or chess clubs or whatever) or any after-school culture of the kind that you may be used to in America (though you can sign your kids up for one extra-curricular activity each, which may or may not take place at your school)   
3. parents do not take their children to and from school when they are as old as your children (by then Swiss children are pretty independent, and all who attend Fribourg state schools live within walking distance) so your ability to connect with other parents and arrange ""play dates"" for them will be really limited    
4. another poster to this thread is correct that in Fribourg your kids would be two of many foreigners (no particular excitement about it). And the poster from Bern is correct that there are few native English-speakers in the mainstream classes in Fribourg, but I don't know how the schools handle primary-school kids who don't speak French--apparently in many areas they mostly attend welcome classes at first, which would mean your kids would become friendly initially with other non-French-speaking kids, and perhaps some of those might be English-speaking, which could derail your plans. Mainstream class kids the age of your older son will have had a year of English in school, and this might help your son socially because English is a little bit ""cool"" here, so kids may try to speak it with your son, which is at least some kind of foot in the social door for him, but they won't speak it well enough for English to be the default language, as long as your sons can learn some French before they arrive.    
5. the Swiss kids in the mainstream programs may not be especially welcoming (not because they are unfriendly, just that they have their groups of friends already, and Swiss kids are not French (or American) in terms of wanting to talk to anyone and everyone and being open to making a new ""best friend"" every day, making and shedding friends fairly casually. I don't find the Swiss cold or unfriendly at all--quite the opposite--but I am someone who doesn't need a lot of social engagements, and I'm not sure that Swiss kids make the same effort that many Swiss adults do. And it has been easier for me than it will be for you because I have young kids, so it is easy to talk to other parents on the playground, not like in primary school. And we're here indefinitely. I do kind of agree with another poster that on some level the administrative support you receive at the state school may subconsciously be effected by your short stay. Lots of immigrants really need to learn French for their ability to function in the long term in Switzerland, and the school needs those kids to learn because the school is responsible for them for the coming years. And I think the Swiss kids, and possibly parents, might discount you a bit also, knowing you'll disappear off the face of the earth in a year.   
But I think with the effort you're obviously willing to put into it, you can have a great experience, and achieve your goals for your kids! Perhaps you can really focus on structuring all your decisions around promoting language-learning and therefore on forced interaction. It's not France, people don't hang around conversing in cafes just for the heck of it! You'll need to seek out situations that involve purposeful engagement. Find groups. Scouting would be perfect, but here in Fribourg I think it only exists in Swiss-German. There are lots of athletic ""clubs"" because of no school sports teams, and you can find music lessons at the conservatoire. You can find activities and sign your kids up from the U.S.--and you should because things fill up. (Speaking of which, um, housing? I kind of thought you had to arrange that farther in advance than just a few months ahead. Do you have leads on areas that you are considering?)   
Even if you are against ""overprogramming"" your kids in the U.S., you should abandon that for this year. I could see someone thinking it would be best to leave the kids' schedules open after school so that they are free to make friends on their own, but that would be a mistake here, given your goals. Group activities where the kids all speak French but the teacher is also able to speak English might be great. It will be easier for your kids to learn French if the teacher can put in a key word or two, I think, and it doesn't involve a risk that your kids will be able to lapse into conversing in English. You are obviously well aware that you have to avoid native-English-speaking kids and groups like the plague!    
And, ok, I can't help it, I have to suggest that you think just once more about private school. Not international school, not English-language school. A school I've written about in Fribourg is ELPF, a small, Swiss, French-speaking private school.    
Just to show you how not-international it is, I'll tell you that the tuition this year for one child was 5,800 CHF (but likely will increase some as it grows) vs maybe 30,000 CHF or so for an international school. (There aren't any in Fribourg, but I've heard they are at least 30,000 elsewhere.) Tuition for additional children is discounted, so for your two kids you'd have paid just 9,600 CHF (total for both tuitions) this year. If you want your kids to stay at school for lunch (or to go early or to stay late), that costs more, and the cost depends on how many days you want that extra time. There is no instruction during this time, just kid-to-kid interaction, so plenty of time to socialize in French!    
The advantage to you would be that it is a small school and easier for you to meet other parents (in order to facilitate socializing for your kids) and for your kids to make friends (it's got a small-community feel to it, and is small enough that I imagine the primary-school kids actually do welcome newcomers). It doesn't have the resources for regular and mainstream classes, so it would be total immersion for your two from day 1! (Assuming the school was willing to take on non-French-speakers--it has a reputation for being somewhat more rigorous academically than the state schools and wouldn't want to slow the other kids down.) I imagine you'd need to get a tutor for the kids--perhaps you could find a university student willing to sit in on your kids' classes and help them at the beginning? Anyway, I'm done and hope I haven't offended you. I really, really support your enthusiasm and determination for language learning, and I think state schools in the Fribourg area could be a great way to go, as could the private school in Fribourg.   
Wait! One more thing, whichever school you go with, maybe post a question to the group about what kinds of things 9 and 11 year old boys think are cool that are not readily available here in Switzerland and that you could pack in your suitcases? (I have young girls and no clue for the older kids.) Little things that could facilitate interaction or serve as token gifts if/when they get invited to another kid's house. Or things to exchange, like whatever the current hand-held game system is for the age group, you might check out whether there are compatible cartridges/games here and bring extra cartridges so that your kids could loan/trade their English ones for for their classmates' French ones. (English is a little ""cool,"" as I said above, and parents here do want their kids to learn English, so, frankly, your kids might be more welcome in their homes if they can also help their friends learn English or at least want to learn English.)    
And maybe post a question asking if anyone here has contacted a teacher before arrival to ask if there is anything they could bring for their kids' classes to enjoy on the first day? Or if their class will perhaps be studying anything during the course of the year that you could ""accessorize"" from America, like bring packets of NASA freeze-dried astronaut ice cream if they'll be doing a unit on space (many people here have never heard of it and  few always wanted to try it), or bring some vintage gee-gaws you can get off of eBay for whatever historical period they may study. (Ebay doesn't exist here.) For end-of-school or Xmas gifts to teachers, we've done things like gift boxes of Jelly-Bellies, maple-syrup samplers, things like that, and the teachers have loved them because it gives them a taste of something genuinely American/foreign that is not available here. (It is REALLY hard to think of American things to give for gifts that wouldn't seem offensive or condescending or poor quality/unnatural and that aren't already available worldwide.) But, ask the group maybe before asking a teacher--teachers tend not to disclose as much about lesson plans in advance as American teachers do, and I don't know if it is on principle or not, if you might be seen as pushy or intrusive for asking. I'm still really new here.     
Good luck!

			Also think in advance what you want - sounds like going to school early may be an option, but if the psychologist comes back and says she isn't ready, or gives a mixed opinion, what do you think?   
Or do you even have a view now - maybe you don't think she's ready, in which case you could say no right now, or express doubt but wait for the opinion in case it has some good points to consider.   
Those running the system (any system, anywhere) may not advertise your rights or encourage you to be involved, but you do have a say on your child's schooling and in Switzerland the normal parameters for moving up and down years are much wider than e.g. the UK.

			Thanks to everybody who have taken the time to respond to my question and thanks Hans1, I will look up that exam centre.     
I found out that you can take CIMA exams in Pearson Vue centers and that there are lots in and around Geneva and Lausanne. As for the study, I think I will take online tuition rather than continue my fruitless search.

			There is a *major* problem with studying psychology in a language that is not your mother-tongue. The profession considers it highly inappropriate as the depth of understanding and communication will simply not be there with the clients/patients that you are supposed to be helping.   
I highly doubt that you will be successful anyway if you do not have the highest command of German to study in German, and especially psychology.   
I did 1-2 years of psych as part of my bachelor's degree and it was hard enough understanding the literature in my mother-tongue, and I had one of the highest literacy levels of anyone in the course... and I barely passed...and a four year psych degree was back then not enough to land a serious job - you would need to go on to do a masters or PhD to get anywhere near a permanent position, unless you were highly successful both academically and socially!

			Hi all. 
I am a 41 years old Danish woman, looking for a Swiss externship in Social work starting September 2015 and 5 months ahead. 
I am living and working part-time in Switzerland (Murten/Bern area). Beside working, I study social work at a remote e-learning education in Denmark done from home plus I attend monthly classes in Denmark.   
In order for me to continue my studies, I need to participate in a 'Praktikum' or externship, that is supposed to start in September this year and is free of charge for the employer/company. Hence, I do not need a salary so this can be almost considered as voluntary work. The only requirements are that I need to accumulate around 30 hours per week of work and that the work comes in the context of social work. Preferable, it should be work related to people and not social service work, where written official German is required. 
I speak English fluently and German at an intermediate level.   
I have already been in contact with many places, but it seems to be difficult to get through with my message, and not to be misunderstood. My 'Praktikum' should not be compared to an apprenticeship, its really 5 month of free work and no obligation for the employer afterwards. 
Would anyone have any ideas to where to apply or even better have contacts to connect me with that could use my hands and help for 5 month free of charge? Preferably in the region where I live.  
Looking forward to hopefully get some ideas! 
Thanks a lot in advance. 
Best regards, 
Karin

			I'm not up on the school side much, but I think you'll find that French will be taught, although not necessarily at the primary level.  It would be added on later when they're older.   
Is this a move for work purposes?  If so, then depending on how far you want any commute to be, you could look at living in Fribourg. It's a bi-lingual canton - French/German - so you hear both languages all the time here.  Depending on which side of the city proper you live on French will be most used (western side) or German (eastern).  It's only an hour and a half by train to get to Zurich.

			Drinking Red Bull and smoking is the #1 extra curricular activity amongst native teenagers!    
Whatever the activity they are currently pursuing you'll almost certainly find it in Switzerland - except perhaps for Rodeo riding. You'll find local bands, tennis clubs etc - and as the activity if linguistically agnostic - they it will get him into an activity that may help his French.   
Remember, everything costs here - often quite a lot more than you hoped.   
As for ski stuff, wait until you get here, borrow some kit - let them try it - if they like buy your own, if not there is nothing lost.

			You might try to meet the teacher as soon as you arrive, or correspond with him/her before you arrive. Some teachers can be quite wonderful about preparing a class to welcome a newcomer, but they naturally are reluctant to do this when they do not know for sure that the child will come. (Arrival plans often go wrong, the date is postponed, a better apartment in another district opens up, you decide to try an international school, etc.) You might bring some trinkets or materials from your home country to send ahead or to give the teacher when you meet, in case s/he might want to use them in class before your arrival to explain where the new child is coming from. Or for your child to give to classmates on his/her first day. Check with the teacher first, of course. Teachers are different, and I've seen the arrival of a new student treated by everyone as a total non-event, and I've seen other teachers really gear the class up to welcome someone new. I don't know if there is anything you can do to make one approach or the other more likely--I'm just guessing about the trinkets and materials.

- a teacher was a canadian student his french was hard to understand  
in both cases parents had to quit these classes 
may be at first to meet the teacher or local parents?

			To add, I am sure that parents who send their kids to the local school learn the local language much much quicker than those who send kids to International school, and also 'integrate' and make local friends much quicker. Possibly because of their initial positive attitude and intentions- but also due to natural contact with local parents and the children + activities.

			Except for the possibility of living at home (most 18-19 yr olds are keen to test their wings...) where your son goes to Uni is very secondary to where you choose to live. Many more undergrad aged students from the UK are also exploring opportunities to study in other EU countries that offer study programs in English.    
I suppose this is the conundrum many parents who have moved to CH find themselves in - just because we may like it here doesn't necessarily mean our children see their futures here. As opposed to ""limiting opportunities"", our family has adopted the ""expanding opportunities"" platform in the decisions we make regarding schooling.

			I'm curious about this program, and have tried reaching out to a few graduates via linkedin, but I might as well try to see if any lurk here.   
I currently work as a data scientist in the US, and want to get more formal stats education to address the weaker aspects of my profile. This program seems to check all the boxes: strong university reputation, relevant curriculum, low tuition (but high COL), and in the most ridiculously aesthetic country in the world (the only objective characteristic in this list (= ).   
Anyone here familiar with this particular program, or with ETHZ's MS programs in general?    
Also I am curious of the admissions standards/process. I noticed HSG has a very formulaic/transparent process (I'd be an auto/near-auto admit to their MBF program based on my GMAT/GPA alone), and was wondering if ETHZ was similar.

			Lots of funny replies here and it is a complicated question.  But I think two key issues are (1) whether you are here for a long time or not, and (2) how old are the kids.  Because if you are here for a short time then the kids will go through a lot of pain and suffering to integrate and then you will take off.  And the younger the kids the easier it will be for them to make the transition.  We have been impressed with ISZL (and we are leaving this summer after two years).  Good luck.

			Hallo everybody,i am a new member ,the best thing you can do is to go to the social insurance and make your questions there.....about how much you pay as already told,that depends by the household income....we pay for example for 3  days a week (2 days from 9.00 until 14.00 with lunch and 1 day from 9.00 until 17.00) 450 to 550 CFR ,that depends also on how many weeks a month is having.so more days that our little is in the kindegarden more we have to pay....

Carefully check the laws concerning education. For example, in Baselland, for certain ages, German grades may not be considered by the administration during the first few years. There are also special considerations for children whose parents are not native German speakers. Teachers may not be aware of these legalities when they grade children or a decision is made on their position within the system.

			Hey Corinna,   
Im a master student,  studying IT and Business Process Management in Liechtenstein and I can definitely recommend the university. Its a small uni (unlike ETH or HSG), so that you really have personal contact with your professors and they really know your name (you can feel much more appreciated and motivated than in huge campuses). Although they dont offer a wide range of master programs, in the four specialisation (Information Systems, Finance, Entrepreneurship and Architecture) they really provide an exceptional quality and our professors are all experts in these fields.   
Concerning the working aspect, there are several international companies in the region that hire Information Systems professionals. The majority of my classmates also work (and all in the field). It did not take them long to find a job. But as a full time student you are only allowed to work 30% in Liechtenstein. There is also an other working possibility offered by the uni, its called student research fellowship. Each semester 3-5 students can work for the institute and can contribute to their research activities (more information here:  ). They made a really convenient schedule, we have lectures only on Thursday, Friday and sometimes Saturday. Vaduz is rather small comparing to Geneva, maybe you would prefer to live and work in other cities such as Sargans/Zurich that is also possible as you basically need to be in Vaduz 2x a week.   
There are some student communities there, but as an international student you are kind of spoiled by the international office. They always organise some nice events and in the beginning of each semester there is a whole week for ERASMUS and international students full of ice breaker programs.

			Hi Chiara - we have a daughter whom we moved from bilingual to public and it was a good experience. We will do the same for our son this August as well. Happy to share what we have learned. Our children are native speakers in two languages that are not German as well, so we have that perspective in common. Send me a private message if you'd like to talk. Cheers, Matt

			Jean-Piaget is the place to go if you want to sit the Goethe exams but if you just need a certificate to show your German level the you can do the Migros school exams.  
The Migros certificates  are acceptable for a permit/naturalisation application as proof if language proficiency. 
The lycée Jean-Piaget site gives links to practice test papers if you need them too.

			Hi, I say go for it as you will all benefit from the challenges and rewards of working/studying and living abroad. There are a number of international schools in the vicinity due to the transient population of Switzerland. The International School of Lausanne is a good school and expanding, over 20% of its students head to the USA. It delivers the International Baccalaureate (IB) which is highly valued by US university (good grades give advanced placement). I encourage you to look at the IB with your daughter and see if it suits her academically and about her thoughts about the change. I'd encourage you not to let university admission decide your path. Live your lives richly and enjoy. Good luck!

538	28.02.2015, 11:21	Forum Veteran	Thanked 2,181 Times in 1,045 Posts	Location: Somewhere in SG	"    As I have said now several times the 'block' time was only mornings from 1st through to 11th grade. There are no holes at all in the morning timetables between 8.15 and 11.00 for any class. 
The afternoon timetable can be all over the place but in practice it's only really for 1st and 2nd and between 9th and 11th that they don't have the afternoons 'blocked' between 13.45 and 15.20. There are also sometimes lessons over the lunchtime period.   
As I understand it they need some flexibility  in the afternoon hours in order to accommodate all the different permutations necessary for the new system which came into force this year.   
There have always been replacement/supply teachers for any lesson during the 'block' time when a teacher is absent for any reason ( even just one lesson) unless it's at the very start or very end if that time and the lesson is always made up at another time.      The rules we were given last week for this area covered the obligatory schooling up to 11th grade Harmos so KG, primary and lower secondary. It's clear that it varies widely from school district to school district here in Neuchâtel too.   
I have no idea what happens in lycée/gymnasium here but given the large numbers of teenagers I've seen hanging around outside the lycées at random times I get the impression that the hours are pretty random too but that seems to be the case in other countries too.

I see.    
Probably, it also depends whether the deadline has passed, i.e. if there is still time to the deadline they do not send answers until they are completely sure that these are the most suitable candidates. Or maybe I am wrong.   
At any rate, it seems that it will take more than one month.

			You might be able to enrol at teacher's college with a Canadian high school diploma, but you'd need C1 French, Italian or German to start. It is a bachelor's degree for Kindergarten and takes three years. 
The other option might be an apprenticeship in Early Childhood education, but quite honestly, I think you'd be better off returning to Canada and finishing your education there, salaries for ECEs in childcare centres are not that good and apprenticeship positions are very hard to come by.

			Thanks Faltrad for your answer. I've lived here for 15 years (was married to a Swiss man for 10 years and speak/ understand the dialect) and my son was born here.    
I see what you're saying in your answer.....Swiss schools educate and turn out students who will be/are good Swiss citizens. This makes sense.    
I've never had the opportunity to really understand the way the Swiss matura works as a national qualification - but what you say also makes sense insofar as it isn't really a national qualification as such but reflects the regional and local ways that Switzerland exists and is fairly independent in that way.    
Also having been part of a Swiss family for over a decade I can see  what you're saying regarding the local and regional bias between cantons.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Public Primary Schools [Basel]	"""CZU"	Posts: 5	2,607	20	Education

			If you read some of the threads here on EF about integrating an older child in the public system, I.e. Over 12, is very difficult and thus most often an international school is the best option , especially if higher education is sought.   Language is very important and often there is not much time to catch up , unless multiple repeats,  if the matura is sought and even with a lot of work and repeats it still might not be possible to get it.

			None of the teaching courses here will be in English. Can you not get your current teachers qualification recognised? If you are teaching English, the German requirement is a little lower B1 or B2 I think. Then you could use that time to improve your German rather than do a second teaching qualification!

			Dear Jayan,   
A publication in a peer-reviewed journal would go a very long way, as would letters, as murphy70 suggested.  However, I also concur that applying only to the ETH is probably a bad idea.   
Do you have good GRE scores?  A good TOEFL score?  These can also partially compensate for poor grades, though it honestly depends on the admissions committee.  Letters and publications, along with a cover letter that addresses your deficiencies, are the best option.

			Hello Everybody, 
I did a search of previous posts, but I could not find answers to my questions (I am not sure my searches were efficient, still learning how to get around in this very resourceful forum- so I am sorry if there is some redundancy). 
We we will be moving to Neuchatel (from the US) in mid-March, since we are about to finalize a lease at St Blaise, I am now looking into daycares and schools, parascolaire etc.. 
I called the creche in St Blaise and Microcity, and not surprisingly, they are both full. I was even told that since I am moving from abroad, without having my papers (not sure which papers?), I cannot sign up for subsidized daycares. I tried to call the official number where I can download the liste d'attente, but they only answers phone between 8 and noon, which is middle of the night for me. I will set the clock and call tomorrow, but maybe I can find some answers from you all too, hopefully. 
1) Do you know what are the requirement to be able to included in the liste d'attente (like an address in Neuchatel, or any document establishing residence? and can they be obtained from the US?). BTW my husband and two daugthers are Swiss citizens. Are the documents the same for Creche (for my 20 months olds), and for the ecole parascolaire (for my 4 1/2 year old who will start school in August)? 
2) It seems that even if I get on the list today, there won't be any spots available for a while, so what's the best alternatives to daycare. I can see that there is something called accueil familial de jour. Is this what we call family daycare here? OR, what's the best way to find a nanny? 
3) What is enrollment process for ecole obligatoire 1st grade for my 4 1/2 years old? I saw that there was an orientation in Feb., can I apply from here? 
We will be both working starting April 1st, so any help that can help us figure out ouw childcare situation is highly appreciated. 
Thank you very much, I have already gotten so many great advices from this forum. I am lucky to have found you all  
Best, 
Bahar

			I also had the same problem. And have got a student visa very easy. First you need to find a school with an intensive german course, 20 lessons per week. I was studying in Aplpha. I just paid for the first month and have got a letter with confirmation that I've applied for 6 month and paycheck( 1 month). Then you need to check on embassy website what else u need. I had to bring my diploma with translation, motivation letter, sponsorship letter, or ur bank reference. Withing one month I have got a visa for 6 months and then extended it for another 6 months. If you want, I can send example of my motivation letter)

			Hiya,    
My husband and I are thinking of enrolling our son in the 2-year old pre-reception class at Collège du Leman (CDL) in the next school year and we were wondering if anyone has any feedback on this programme or has heard any reviews from friends and family. We also understand that there is after school day care for the little ones, which is also of interest to us as we both work full time. Has anyone had any experience with either the 2-year old programme or the after school care?    
Any information would be welcome!    
Many thanks in advance.

			Hi, 
We live in Risch, just outside of Rotkreutz. Some friends here send their kids to the local, some to the international school -experiences seem to be very individual -some positive some negative.  
Is german a problem? Integration depends on the kids picking up Swiss-german quickly. An english accent is generally a plus point. 
Be careful in the last two years of primary school -decisions are being made as to whether the child will go on to the gymnasium (grammar school) or to sek (old style english secondary modern).

I am a great proponent of local schooling but only when it does not/ will not affect the child's education/ wellbeing. If it is for a year, I'd go with the mum's instinct, which is to make sure her kids do not feel the burden of a new language.

			Hi Jen,   
Sorry for the late response - I don't check EF that often...   
It's interesting that you got such a definitive response from ASK and Autisme CH about local schooling in Geneva. Here in Nyon, some children whose needs are not met in the local school system are offered places in a specialist day school. We were invited to have a look round and it looked fantastic - a great pupil/teacher ratio, tailored to fit in with individual needs. The learning support offered by the local system is also very good, but of course in French. The other hitch is that access to all of this is via the school psychology service which itself is accessed by request from the parent (not through the school), so you have to know what exists to know to ask for it, and then to keep on asking until you get it. Our paediatrician was great for advice on this. But Nyon is in a whole different canton, and the parents at ASK will have been through all this in Geneva : if they say that it's a dead-end, I would trust their experience.   
My impulse regarding international schools would be to contact the schools that you're interested in, give them as much information as you can about your son (recent reports, feedback from educational psychologists etc) and allow them to decide whether they can give him the support that he needs.    
One of the things that really impressed me about GES was that several senior staff members were involved in meeting my son, seeing how he got along in class, as well as taking the time to understand his condition. Ultimately he got to spend the day with his potential future class / teacher to see how it went. This way, both sides were happy to know they were making a decision based on as much information as possible - and it has been a great success.   
However, GES is a small school and can't offer to meet everyone's needs. We were told in very certain terms right from the beginning of the application process that if they felt they couldn't give our son the support he needed then they absolutely would not offer him a place. I felt this was very fair, and would have respected their decision even if it had meant finding another school.   
From what I remember, the Ecole Internationale de Genève offers more specialised support for children with 'moderate to complex learning difficulties' but it comes with a steep price-tag. There's lots of information on their website  . There's also a specialised school in Morges, but I'm sure Autisme CH will be able to give you more information there.   
Good luck with your search - PM me if you'd like more information!

			Here is a resource I found from another expat for tutoring, below some other ideas for meeting a dyslexic child's needs in school:   
Know-now.ch   
This company matches tutors and families, costs about 60 CHF a lesson (hour?) if they come to you, 47CHf if you go the their offices. Matches University or gap year students. You can try to pick a person and you get one chance with a person matched. Can't say how well it works yet but the Mom who has used it found a good tutor for her slightly dyslexic daughter. I've have had no luck with the teacher training school, and the one person that worked really well with my son got too busy so we are still trying to find support.   
Other Schools in Zürich:   
There are also a lot of Montessori schools which can be great for dyslexics. They don't always want to take kids with learning issues though. And my son probably has something (as well? or instead of ?) called auditory processing disorder and I'm not sure the classes are quiet enough for him. Plus they are pricey but if it's only one child there is always a way.   
Steiner schools are also more tailored to individuals' talents I'm told and they have a sliding scale in one case... but is Steiner's whole philosophy followed? Sounds a bit flakey in certain instances....Anyone familiar with the Steiner school, philosophy...   
A friend of a friend said a child she knew got good support in a semi-private church-run school...there are so many private schools in Zürich I don't really know how to narrow the list...   
The public school is really providing quite a lot of support through the German as second language class and now once a week auditory therapy. And there are procedures to try to get more help if it's not enough.    
ELSEWHERE SWITZERLAND   
There is a school solely for anglophone kids near Geneva that takes them for part of the day and then they are back at their private anglophone schools after that. It's called Oak Hill School. They claim they are the only school in Europe specifically for kids with these problems. Surely they mean the only Anglophone school. But there are lots in UK. Is UK not part of Europe?

Does anyone have experience with Cycle d'orientation schools? In Germany the children have a primary school = 4 years + a lycée/gymnase = 8 years which means that my son is already visiting a gymnase (7 grade).   
Will a cycle d'orientation be academically a step down for him, or are they at an equal level? What I mean is: I understand that a gymnase is only starting with the grade 10 in Geneva, but how is the quality of a cycle d'orientation school - can it be compared to a German or French gymnase at that level (since you do earlier to gymanse's in those countries)?

			I don't think that you can get enrolled automatically at EPFL, unless they changed something recently. So far you always had to apply to the doctoral school that you're interested in and even if the professor has agreed to hire you, the school may not accept you (unlikely, but it may happen).

			I think it depends on how old your children are. The plus points for us were that  they did UK exams, the staff were helpful and the Principal was great.   
BUT the resources were not up to scratch in our opinion for  A' level Students.  I think it felt as if the down the line it would be a real alternative but for us with a 16 year old it was not really a good match at present.   
My advice is go and visit get a feel for it and your decision will be sooo much easier. Good luck

Furthermore, the Swiss teachers have no problem telling a rich arrogant parent that the child doesn't go to gymnasium because of grades, making it a far more academicly fair system than any private one. I belong to the people who send Swiss students to university (and quite a fw Germans too, but that's another story), and take my professional word: you have obviously no idea.    
I am usually far nicer, but you realy pushed it too far in only a few messages. Late reaction, I know, but I am truely furious      
For the Tuborg/susan question, I would say that the international system is not made for apprenticeship in the first place. Of course it doesn't match! The Finnish system either, by the way, even with all the gold medals it got. Education is vertical, it means that one step leads to other logical steps. Not all steps aside are possible or natural. It is a design issue, not level or quality one.

			Hi, If you are wondering about kindergarten then you do not need to look or apply for one as soon as your child is of kindergarten age (4 or 5 years depending on the date of birth and the cantons rules) you will receive an application form directly from the stadt office.

			Hi Glasgow1,   
Welcome!  
I was in Switzerland with my family when I was 9. I didn't speak French at all and I was in a ""classe d'accueil"" in the beginning (I had extra hours of French class but I follow the normal class for math, and other fun classes). After (almost) a year the teacher saw my progress and I was soon integrated in a normal class with the local kids.    
I think kids at that age learn language super fast so there is nothing to be worried about. Back then I was so motivated to learn French cuz I couldn't even play with my classmates during ours breaks haha  !    
I don't get the streaming issue though, I'm doing a PhD in Engineering now...   
Good luck!

			Hi Zeenat, 
Your 3 yr old will probably go to the ZIS Kilchberg campus and the 6 yr old to the Waedenswil campus, a good 20 mins driving distance from each other. Living in Zug is not going to help. Like someone else suggested, better to stay in any area between Kilchberg and Waedenswil. Horgen/Thalwil have good train connections. The school has a bus service. Your husband can do the commute rather than the kids.  
This being Switzerland, it is generally quite safe and there are no compounds or gated communities as such. There are loads of expats scattered all over and the school will also do a great job of putting you in touch with people from your community if you want so that you and the kids settle down faster. I am a ZIS mum with a 6 yo son so if u need any other info feel free to get in touch. 
All the best with your move.

			Thanks for the response. We were primarily interested in language immersion and started looking at summer camps. We've traveled in Switzerland a few times and thought it would be an excellent spot for summer programs. Once I started researching the camps, I realized that many of them are run by the boarding schools.      
Spending a year or two in a boarding school would fit with our family situation and would allow for even greater language learning for our daughter, in addition to all the other benefits of cultural exchange.      
We'd like to find a smallish school with strong academics and moral support (she's currently in a classical Catholic school). Italian is the language she is most interested in but, with the exception of TASIS, there doesn't appear to be a boarding school in Ticino. (In fact, finding Italian language immersion camps in Italy isn't that easy, that's why I have a question about the Alpadia camp in Ascona in the languages thread.) She's also interested in learning German or French (currently taking Latin).     
We think that if we can find a school that looks like a good fit, attending the summer camp would be an excellent way of checking.     
Kind of a long response---thank you for any insights or advice.

			This is a very interesting question.    
I have to say that this quote ""She would the art of excellent communication skills, how to be an extrovert, to be creative, the ability to laugh, sing and dance and play, be spontaneous and have fun. Plus, she would learn Swiss German"" could not be more far removed from the Swiss primary that I spent a day observing; though going to see another one this week where a friend teaches.     
It is however pretty much a description of my ideal school (with exception for the over-emphasis on so-called 'extroversion'; does anyone know one that exists like this?!    
As far as the UK goes, it is hard to generalise also, since it depends where you live, private versus state, etc. That said, my godchildren, all are regular state school primaries, frankly seem to be doing a LOT more creative stuff than kids in the local school I have seen here.    
That said, Michael Gove's successor seems determined to continue his drive to eliminate arts in schools, with dance now out of the curriculum and more and more anti-arts emphasis, so who knows (  - the most articulate description of why we should value subjects equally and not educate children out of their heads that I know).   
When I posted the other day requesting comments on Swiss primaries, one person responded that they had not witnessed much use of punishment or shame in their school, but I certainly witnessed the teacher I observing talking about giving children lines, and heard of another class in the same school where lemons are given to children that are 'naughty'. The not-so-modern concept of fostering children's receptivity and creativity through fostering connection and relationship does not seem to have arrived here yet.   
The main thing so far I can see to recommend Swiss primaries, apart from the extortionate fees charged by private schools in Switzerland, is their local aspect and the fact that the hours are much less, leaving perhaps much more time for kids to either have free, unstructured time (if they are not educated out of knowing what to do with free, unstructured time though an emphasis on rote learning, that is); or to explore their own interests and importantly to have more connection with family too.

			We had NickatBaselJnr at Kinderkrippe Susanna as soon as he was on solid food - from about 6 months old in 2007 until he was just 3 - after which we moved to Zurich. It started life as Kinderkrippe Eva - they were in a former Ethiopian restaurant on Shönaustrasse and they later moved to Erlentor site. At the time they were slowly expanding it to be multilingual etc but it was primarily German.    
The two women in charge were from former East Germany so spoke High German with the children - most of the helpers were local Basel girls so Swiss German being spoken. We were quite happy with this arrangement as we are Dutch / English speaking at home and it meant he acquired Swiss German from an early age. I notice from the website that it is pretty much the same people running it as when our son was attending - we were quite satisfied with the care he received.   
If you are planning to remain in CH longterm I would recommend aiming at the Swiss public system - our son started ""Chindsgi"" (the first stage of compulsory Swiss education) in 2012 and he is now 7 years old and in first year primary. So far we have been satisfied with the quality of the Swiss public system, plus it gave us a chance to get to know some Swiss parents and to integrate into society a little more. As he is not from a German speaking household, at Kindergarten they had a woman coming in to give such kids a little extra coaching with their German. Since he has been to primary school, he hasn't needed any additional help with German.   
For his English and Dutch, we pay privately for him to attend 1hr a week at a literacy hour for English native speakers held at the AWC in Zürich and he also goes with my wife to a class for native Dutch speakers for a few hours on Wednesdays. There they follow a potted version of the Dutch primary school curriculum. We just wanted to make sure he develops a good command of english and Dutch - particularly written - so if in later life he decides to attend university etc in NL or UK, hopefully language will be less of a barrier for him.    
The advantage of the English and Dutch classes is he is already reading and writing quite well in English and Dutch - as well as German. The Swiss children in his primary school are only just starting to learn their letters - but they will catch up over the next year.   
I assume you and your husband will raise your child bilingual - i.e. make sure you speak always English to him or her and your husband always German / Swiss German - from the moment the child is born - and stick to that strictly. Also insist when the child is old enough to speak that you are addressed in English and your husband in German. This will benefit the child no end in the longrun.   
Cheers,

			Do you have any friends who are local, as in been living there for a long time, or born and bred there- with whom you could discuss this and ask for their support. It could help- as you may be perceived by some as a foreigner who does not understand how things are done here, blablabla. Maybe that person could walk with you and daughter one day, and give said child what for in Swiss German, as a local... and tell him s/he will talk to his mother, family and teacher if he keeps this on.

I am interested about the same information, all I could dig is this statistic from the Zurich statistics office that say the promovability to Sekundar Schule in the Zurich Uto school area is 20%, which is not bad but not great compare to the star Kilchberg or Russchlikon or Zurichberg :    
I'd be interested in other opinions, too!

			2.1 degree in chemical engineering is probably a minimum requirement for EPFL. To get into any Master program in EPFL, you need a good/excellent academic record. I heard that EPFL's master admission is first screened by secretaries so your grades is what they see first.    
The employees in the admission center won't answer questions such as ""What are my chances to get in?"" since they are normally not allowed to answer those kind of questions.    
Good luck!

			And be aware that the age profiles for Swiss grades are often quite different to UK/US/Australia etc, and so a child may do an additional year of schooling on entry, so that they are not significantly younger than the rest of the children - doing an extra Kindergarten or first Primary school year is often the least stressful way to do this... my children all did/are doing an extra year - because they entered school younger than the 'swiss' age profiles - my eldest did 2x grade 4, the middle child 2x grade 1 and the youngest an extra 'kindergarten' year.

			I agree with abi_bouw, with the additional note:  most daycare workers (day care facility is Kinderkrippe in German, Creche in French) speak at least minimal English, so the transition will be easier with an English-speaking child than, say, a Spanish or Russian speaker.   
From our experience with children in the Krippe, two can be a difficult time for children to learn, so do consider starting slowly (perhaps with half-days, if that's possible for your family) and expect some behavioral problems that will linger for around six months-things like biting or potty-training regression.   
Also, do make an effort to learn the local language as well, to help your child learn the new vocabulary.  Before you know it, your child will be your translator as well!    
Finally, be prepared for the price of day care, which is quite high-at least 2400 CHF and up to 3200 CHF per month for a full time spot is the going rate in Zürich (unsubsidized).

			My 4 year old is in kindergarten where they speak French. After about 4 weeks he started picking up the language. After about 10 weeks he is speaking to us in sentences, but if he doesn't know a word he fills it in with gibberish or arriba or abajo (thanks, Dora the Explorer).  
Your child will do great in a French school or German school. But I recommend you learn French as well so you can talk to your child at home. My husband always talk to my son and helps fill in the gibberish holes. My son now speaks French better than I do.

			Hi EF   
In two weeks we will be in living in Kuesnacht and I'm looking to keep my native english speaking son playing regularly with high german speaking kids. We've been in DE for a year and his German is really great. Since he will start kindergarten next Summer we have found a preschool place hard to get in Kuesnacht and he will join the Familienclub 3 half days per week, of course this will be Swiss-German.   
Ideally I would like to set up a weekly play date.   
The bonus for me (and possibly you) would be that I could also exchange some English conversation for High German conversation. My level is probably A2... I understand a lot but need speech practice.    
TIA

			The first thing I would consider is how your son feels about the prospect of yet another year of obligatory schooling with a curriculum imposed on him. What is the particular goal that his grades are not sufficient to reach? If he began school at age 4 in UK (just an assumption based on stated English origin) I woukd think by now he is more tired of school - and a certain type of compulsory education routine - than tired of learning. I think another year in same setting might not accomplish your desired result.   
What lies ahead should he not complete another year - you say he is in private schooling, but difficult to really understand situation without knowing if it is British GCSE based, IB or other.

			Another positive experience:   
My son, next month he turns 7, had issues with another child from the same school. i am not sure if i should call the behavior bullying. My son walks to the Kinder hort (daycare) which is about 400 metres from the school. so i have not witnessed what actually happens on those daily walks. the daycare people saw my son being kicked and his school bag & gym bag being tossed and they promptly intervened. they spoke to the boy who did it and asked him not to repeat. i was asked by the day care team to report to the school.    
i was not sure what to expect but nonetheless i felt it was important to let my son's teacher know especially since my son knew the other boy. The teacher was visibly upset when i told her and she said it is not an acceptable behavior. she took up the matter with the teacher of the other boy and the boy has been warned.    
I was pleasantly surprised and definitely happy that the teacher/school did not have a relaxed attitude to this kind of behavior. And i sincerely hope the boy in question does not resort to any other means to hurt my son. The day care team are keeping a watch.

			I recommend contacting the Arbeitskreis für Deutsch als Fremdsprache in der Schweiz  . We have come into contact with two excellent teachers via that route, one for OH (adult) and one for our son (12 yrs). They are very professional and specialised (unlike some others we have encountered through commercial language schools or private individuals hanging out their shingle as language teachers).

			Hi everyone,    
I was wondering if anyone had any experience with getting their foreign diploma recognized by SERI (State Secretariat for Education Research and Innovation). I submitted mine (for social work, U.S.) about 6 weeks ago and received an email saying that it was received, but I haven't heard anything since then.   
On the SERI website it says that the whole process can take up to 4 months, but I have also heard up to 6 months. Can anyone who has been through the process share what they went through and how long the process took? I know there is a preliminary application and then a formal one, roughly how long does each one take to process?   
Any insight would help! I'm biting my fingernails a bit...

			Hi,   
I want to register my daughter to french summer camp in France but I couldn't decide to which school is optimum for me. I mean; education quality, fun and of course budget..   
I found some schools such as Ecole des Roches, Azurlingua, Accord, OISE and CMEF Monaco summer camp. OISE is very expensive but Ecole des Roches may be suits best for me. According to their website, 3 weeks is  3310 but I found some agency sites also that they say the price is  3480 (Source:     May be there are some agency fee or something else.   
I know there are french summer schools in Switzerland also. But they are very expensive than France. My question is, is it worth to pay more? Does anyone has registered in summer camps in Switzerland?

			And btw the Sprachkurse are useful for other reasons besides motivation - you can do dialogues with the other students and improve your speaking skills. You can have your writing assignments graded and revised. Whereas for the CFA...sadly going to a class cannot help. You simply have to sit down and spend ridiculous amount of time to memorize it all. The good news is that its not complicated, there is no any particularly difficult math or stuff. The hardest part for me was to memorize the formulas. But then again, I only passed level 1 so far...

			Thank you Asatarai, 
You have very good points and those are exactly the criterias I followed to choose the school for my son.  I finally opted for the school in Bioggio. The principal is really nice and the school looks nice overall with a great lunch and after school program. My son will start in November, so hopefully it was the best choice.   
Thank you again.      Thank you Tom.  That is the school I chose for my son.  Let's hope for the best.

664	07.10.2014, 22:09	Member	Thanked 71 Times in 41 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Hmmm, lovely....it is really interesting. I think the war of theories and data has always been that way but I do think good old Europe with certainly outdated but still very humanities based edu concept does promote a bit more the synthesis of both. Maybe I am biased the way we were trained, just for the sake of balance, dig into the side we were veering off. Or maybe I was lucky to grow up in that kind of traditional humanities combined with sci environment in my family setting, but it honestly seems more taught and worked with. Research chez nous is not really about returning investments (since there are little commercial interests), whatever course is justified and will promote progress has relatively same chance to be a part of curriculum, humanities pushed on sci majors and vice versa. I miss it these days, inter disciplinary is often just a term everywhere, still. The lack of funding was and is not ideal at all, though, I think I would have prefered an environment far more ambitious and daring in terms of both theorizing and data harvest, even if overkill in either of them. Resources are important, CH has a big chance.       
I talked to some US Soc-IT diss collegaues, and it still seams to be very divided, despite the progress, you are still pushed to take sides, or expected to. You do not really belong to neither and float between the two departments. I am doing an interdisciplinary study, and while I enjoy the independence I really can feel the freedom is paid by far more responsibility to get anchored, support ideas tangibly and concretely, etc. You kind of bounce off the two poles. Being part of all and none of it, and know exactly which area and sci approach or methodological coaching or inspiration for a new theory you can reach for. I fall back on my sci family often since they have a lot of tools and strategies, rely on supervisors and very concrete sci approach and enjoy theorizing as a reward when things get done, to be able to process what has been laid out there for me, still.     
What you mentioned about judgment and bias, lovely. I am focusing right now on automation in assessment, matrixes are fab field to study. Hard to identify, starts with identifying the ability to either copy and reproduce or invent, creatively. Our judgment is so multicriterial we cannot handle it sometimes, so it is logical we oscilate between the two extremes, relying too much on a preset algorithm or not enough on a frame that is already available.

The best solution is for the parents to leave - most times the kids cry 5-10 min max, and if not then they can call you if the child won't calm down.  But knowing that mommy is hovering outside waiting to sweep in will not help the child and can start a chain reaction as you noticed...   
It can be hard, as a parent, to leave when you child is calling and reaching for you, but this bit of independence is good for them.   
And don't be surprised if your child reverts back to this after a time of you leaving without any tears - kids have all sorts of phases and separation anxiety can hit any time    But with all things kids related, it is always just a phase, and hopefully a short one!

Tasebo you hit the nail on the head, teaching is much more effective when it's not done by a parent.   
My daughter and I are working through a book of reading lessons currently, but it's slow going, the focus is not there as much as it would be with a teacher.   
The other issue is that I work full time and my husband works away in the weeks so the evenings are too short (and she's too tired) after dinner so that only leaves the weekends so ""spending a few hours"" to do this doesn't happen

			At least at ETH, you complete the courses at the same time as you do your Master and as said, not only foreigners can have these requirements. At least in my studies, many of my classmates and I had the feeling that some of them were chosen rather randomly, sometimes to your advantage. Some of the courses are interesting, but some are just (a bit) of pain in the asses and can be quite irrelevant as well, depending on your focus(es) in the master. Much of it could been acquired in your master courses anyway (and will), so I don't really see the point of most of it.

			not sure where you are but here in lausanne is an organization that fits tutors from gymnase or uni who tutor for not too much and have themselves taken the classes and exams not so long ago.    
we have a great extra help from one for going on three years and the important part is it provides a connection and some confidence and some clear experience and direction from someone my boy can relate to. ask the teacher/director at their school if there is something similar. the exams can be stressful for them, it's a lot of pressure and that makes a difference, esp if they're already dealing with a few languages and transitions

When I did mine they let me off the 1st year modules (as I have a previous degree so only needed to do a psychology major) so I went straight into 2nd and 3rd year ones.  Starting with the 1st year modules is easy enough to get into it, then it gets progressively harder, but at a manageable rate.  I've got almost 2 masters now, it's definitely a subject that you can tackle at different and increasingly complex levels.

			You could try looking for classes in the Biel/Bienne area. This is a bilingual town so the majority of their websites will have both languages.   
You could also try Murten/Morat which is in canton Fribourg but which also has most things in both languages.   
I think your biggest problem though is actually the dates you are looking at. 
The autumn school holidays in canton Bern are from September 20th until October 12th and in Frbourg are from October 20 th until October 31st.

			If cost is an issue for you, then looking into the local Spielgruppes is a really good idea. They are usually very reasonably priced and the children are only there a short time (in our area they are mostly 2 1/2 to 3 hours long). Although this doesn't sound particularly long, I found with both my girls that it was plenty of exposure to the language at this age. They would literally get home at lunchtime and fall asleep because they were so tired!    
Also it's worth looking out for 'Spielgruppe plus' ones as they have additional language support. We were really impressed with the one our girls went to - it was incredible how quickly they started to speak the lingo, and the mornings were very structured, which gave them a good start in Kindergarten.   
I'm personally not sure its completely helpful for children to know that their carers also speak English - I've known so many children that have carried on speaking English to their carers literally years after they've been in a bilingual environment because they know that they understand them. I've always told anyone looking after my kids that I would prefer them to speak German (unless there is a dire emergency). Also it means they don't pick up a Swiss accent when speaking English.   
In our area there is also language support in Kindergarten, but perhaps we are just lucky - I hadn't realised this was not the case in all areas.

			Good morning, 
We are moving to Switzerland (nr Geneva) next summer and have a 14-yr old who has done all their schooling in English.   
Does anyone have children in (secondary MS/HS) any of these schools? Pros/cons to discuss? I have contacted all of the above, seems that availability is there.  Cost is abominable  
 Are there any other schools between Geneva and Morges that offer a curriculum in English?      
Does anyone have experience with moving a non-French-speaking teenager into the Vaudois system?    
Thanks for all advice/opinions.

			There are also private preschools to choose from in the Zurich area.    
My son attended a combination of private preschools and Spielgruppes since he was 3 years old.     
At the beginning of last year (he was 4 y.o.) I finally found an amazing Bilingual preschool in Zurich Witikon which he attended three mornings per week. This particular preschool used structured materials in combination with open play sessions. They taught him songs,  seasons, numbers, read stories and held classes in English for one hour then German for one hour. It was a breath of fresh air to find him a place where he was actually learning and not just ""killing time"". He just started Kindergartner this year but to this day still sings the songs taught by that particular preschool.    
There are options you just need to find them.    
Majority of the Spielgruppe's I tried were disappointing. They didn't differ from Krippe's approach which was just a waste of money.     
Good luck in your search, if you need more information please PM me directly.

			Hi, 
I don't know if anybody has posted that before, I tried to find out but no results. 
Anyways, City of Zurich organises an interesting course aimed at ladies who have moved to Zurich (or the area) recently. It is called "" "". You can learn about many things: starting from the basic stuff on Switzerland, through school system, health insurance, social insurance to how and where to find an apartment etc. It is held in different languages once a week on Wednesday morning (8:45 - 11:15) for about three months in the city centre. It is really reasonably priced (60 CHF per the whole course). Additionally, a child care is provided too (it costs extra 30 CHF). 
You can find the details here:     
and then a pdf file in your language. 
The next course begins on September 17th. 
Highly recommended if you want to get some useful information and also meet new ladies :-)

			Hi Sarantin.  The greek schools operate with teachers sent from greece, belonging to the greek school system and following similar teaching styles as in Greece. Unfortunately , teaching occurs only one day a week for about 3,5 hours, plus breaks. As somebody coming directly from Greece, do not expect that your children will maintain the same standard as kids in Greece. If you choose to stay, their greek learning will slow down significantly. Perhaps you can do academic type things with them if you have the time, and of course visit back home as often as you can.   
As far as I know, the Saturday morning classes (8:00) take place at schoolhouse Kernstrasse, in Kreis 4, close to Helvetiaplatz.    
The Sat. Afternoon classes at school Apfelbaum in Oerlikon (13:45).   
The Wed. classes at Kantonschule Oerlikon ( 14:00).   
I personally thought the organization of Schule Apfelbaum was really great. The parents´association is really proactive and run by good and effective people.   
Kernstrasse is the biggest school, and more central in the city, but I can´t really say much about it.    
Here :       
a link with a list of schools in all of Switzerland.

			As far as I know, all the school people do is teaching, they are not supposed to look at your permits and care about your situation. The town should handle these aspects for you. 
While they would rather know as soon as possible how many children are going to school, you can register your kid anytime. You don't need to apply or anything. This is a public school after all. 
Your kid can go to another school that the one in the town you live in at certain conditions.   
The real issue here is the apartment. You need a permit to apply for an apartment and need a regular income (at least 3 times the rent). The owner will ask about your debts and your income. They can legally ask up to 3 months of rent in advance. I advise to open what they call a ""compte bloqué"" at the bank. It's an account that can only be used for that purpose. It's probably safer than giving the money directly to the lessor.   
If you have any issue or question with the apartment, you might want to get some advice from the Asloca - Association suisse des locataires - which exists also in the German and Italian speaking parts of the country despite the name. It means ""tenants association"", it's not a relocation agency.   
Apartment leases usually start / end around September and March, but you can ask the previous tenant to sublet the apartment if he/she leaves it earlier or arrange something with the lessor.   
Best would be to visit and choose an apartment before the summer. There are several websites listing vacancies: ImmoScout24, HomeGate, ...

			I really like your reward system, Leggat, can somebody reward me? Hahahah, I am kidding. Adopt a mod!    
The time slots work great, I either do the reg '25-'50 time management (it helps if we are a team) when I have to compartmentalize more than I would like, or I have chapter based slots, when I can be led by content.    
Kids usually work well with content based time-work management (having natural breaks between chapters, or books, docs), with something motivating them, but it should be the feeling of accomplished work and progress to motivate them, not really a material reward..I did have a cheesecake yesterday with a fellow study group member, and it worked fab as a reward.    
Happy Friday, I gotta get to it again.

			Many children who arrive here need to ""repeat"" a year, so to speak, sometimes due to their birth date, and other times because the school felt it was in their best interest to start a level lower. But most get over it quite quickly. 1st grade elsewhere is not necessarily the same as the 1st class here. I think 1st class is the best place for your son to start. Be sure to explain that he is not repeating a year. It's a different system and he will be learning in a new language.    
My experience with children leaving local schools and moving elsewhere is that often the new location considers the Swiss school system quite advanced and strives to put the child in the most age appropriate grade in the new location whether this is international school or local school.    
Sometimes the new school will look at report cards and grades. Your biggest challenge will be to maintain the level of English so that your son can manage in the US where this will be the language of instruction if and when you return to the US. Who knows, you could be one of those ""lingerers.""

			Hi Veronica, we are back late from the States, sorry. We have been very happy so far with everything at this school. The educational concept is extremely sophisticated and reality has not always been able to meet the intentions but this is the normal thing, I presume. We have never ever seen a team like this dedicated to the thrive and blessing of the children. Even if you subtract 50% of the ideals, your children still profit more than anywhere else.

			They cannot tell because there are no such requirements (other fields at ETH may have very strict admission requirements). What you should do:  
1. Have a look at the following document (there is a German version somewhere as well) and make sure that so many of your courses overlap (""Auflagen"" is no fun), detailed description of them could be searched at    
2. Write a good motivational letter.  
3. Hope for the best.

			I will give one point of view, take it or leave it but it's only meant as food for thoughts. I teach older students.     
1) You are the only one knowing what your budget can do. There is a French primary school in Basel, have a chat with them and see if they start at ""maternelle"" (kindergarten/preschooling).   
2) Administration in France is actually the same if you do it all legal. Nannies are always expensive because they are people working, it's their living. Facts of life.   
3) If coming and leaving is a huge issue, think international school. If it is only in the back of your mind, then make it a language choice because the academics is marginally different at that age.    
4) France is academically demanding but the Swiss (and Germans) catch up in early middle school anyway so don't make it a decisive point. France give teachers academic freedom, it means that they can't be forced to teach any specific way. Consequence: your favorite school might not be your neighbours' favorite school. One MUST take the time and talk to the primary teachers of the schools that comes into mind in your situation. How strict it is depends on the school culture and how teachers/directors make it, it's not really due to the system as such. French parents are very demanding in education, so your children will be with students whose parents are academically pushy. The more ""middle class"" the area, the stronger this push will be. It's NOT a money issue, it's a reflection of deep French cultural and social structures (not one-to-one comparable to the UK or the US).   
5) France with children gives you more tax advantages than Switzerland with children. The exact math is different for everybody. Basel/France is usually close to evenly taxes for singles (as long as the medical insurance issue stays the way it is at the moment). Families with children tend to move to France, not the Switzerland.   
Adding 6) Education is done in a language that will be fundamentally important to your children. Choose the one (French or German or English), then choose the place (German = Basel public school ; French = France or Basel French primary ; English = international school). It's a long term impact on their identity. French school is…. ""different"", not everybody's taste. Swiss education can be quite academic with focus on grades but also gives big space for vocational and professional education that can lead to great careers at high level.

			If you want US gymnastics like beam, bars, etc., you will want to look for Geräteturnen.  Sorry, I live a bit far from you but our local sports club (Turn- or Sportverein) offers it.     
The one they have for the younger kids is called Kinderturnen but I am not sure it is for 3 year olds - as it mentions 2. Kindergarten kids, who would be 5-6 years old.   
ETA:  if you go to the link Tom gave you and navigate to ""Geräteturnen"" on the right hand side of the page you will find the US style gymnastics part of the club.  That might be more what you are looking for, again, I am not sure how old you have to be to start.  They train 2 x a week and also have to take part in several competitions throughout the year    
This group says they bridge the gap from ""Muki-Turnen"" to the ""Mädchen"" level.   and it might be more what you are looking for?

			Hello all,   
I am interested in taking some part-time evening courses in clock repair.  Would anyone have some information on where I can find a course that would also be offered in English -- preferably close to Basel.   
much appreciated.

			I don't think it is impossible to keep up with enough English to rejoin a US school on your own by making sure the kids read age appropriate English books regularly, to expand their English vocabulary. Bring some workbooks for grammar. Have them keep a journal or write to their friends back home for writing and spelling. 
Writing skills like how to structure essays, write summaries, letters, etc., are transferable between the languages.

			Our kids went to Allegra and it took them approx 50 min each direction to get there. Buss, tram, train, walk. They get used to it and the days are a bit shorter than the normal school so no big deal. Also it was a great opportunity for them to get used to the independance kids generally have at an earlier age in Switzerland.   
Why pay for it privately when the gemeinde supports you with Allegra? Save the money for later when maybe you have to go private for other reasons.

			Well, as I said you can manage outside those dates, but it's a bit more difficult.  An agency will know how to deal with that side of things.   
I was thinking more along the lines of whether the uni has any ""preferred"" agencies/landlords it works with and whether they would back you up if you find a place you'd like to rent before you arrive.  Sometimes landlords/agencies are a bit wary if you don't have your permits first, but if the employer confirms that you are being employed by them it can make a difference in getting that rental contract.   
I would advise you to research your US tax obligations while you're out of the country.  The US taxes on citizenship, not residency as in the rest of the world so you're required to file US tax returns no matter where you live.  Start here on the IRS website.       
I would also advise you to bring copies of your recent US tax return filings with you as you may need them to open a bank account here.  This is due to the US's FATCA law requiring banks worldwide to report US clients' account info to the IRS.  You'll need to sign a W-9 form at the minimum, but may need to provide proof that you're also tax compliant.  Search the forum's Finance/Taxation section for FATCA and you'll find several threads about the problems Americans have in getting/keeping accounts here nowadays.

			I agree with all the other posts but would add that a very good quality winter jacket, hat and gloves are all important for obvious reasons given the weather. The kids also play out whatever the weather and there's lots of activities such as skating and visits to forests etc. The other thing for winter is really good quality winter boots with good soles and here these cost 100 - 140 Fr for a good quality pair out here. Most kids would also have waterproof jackets, rain trousers and walking boots in addition. I find it's quite a lot to organise for each child each year!

			We will be moving to Zollikon in December (waiting for the contract, but seem to be settled). Our daughter is 4.5 and is currently attending a private daycare in Oerlikon which also has Kindergarten. After moving we would like to send her to the public kindergarten, but we need a Hort place for 4 days (we both work, 80% and 100%). I talked to the school administration briefly and they assured me that they try to find a solution for newcommers, including hort, but they will need to check. They assume it would be Oescher Kinderhort.   
I'm trying to make an appointment but they are in a bit idle mode due to the summer holidays. Does anyone have expectation for the place availability? And what most important, since most (or even all) Kindergarten are not at the exact same place as Hort (300 to 1200 meters away), do they care to bring the child to the Hort for the afternoon? I saw a couple of threads here discussing this issue and it seems that not all Kindergarten care about it, which makes me scared.   
Thanks in advance!

			Firstly, do you speak a Swiss language?  Because if you don't then you won't be able to study here.  Bachelor courses are taught in Swiss languages only, though many Masters are taught in English.   
This site will tell you all you need to know:       
If you click on the study courses in English and then find a course you're interested in it may tell you what grades are needed.   
And yes, medicine (human medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine) and chiropractic as well as in human movement and sports sciences are restricted to people who have lived in Switzerland/Lichtenstein for a minimum of 5 years or are nationals of those countries.

			I want to do a Masters of Finance at UNIL. I believe I meet all the prerequisites, but am having a hard time getting someone at the school to give me a direct answer about what I need to do to be sure.   
Could someone tell me if I stand a good chance to be admitted to the program, based on my credentials/background?   
-Two bachelor's degrees, in business administration and accounting, with a minor in economics, from an accredited US university. Decent grades but not perfect 
-3-4 years work experience, doing business valuation, financial analysis, and corporate finance 
-Passed level one of the CFA exam curriculum   
Is there anything else I should do to increase my chances?   
Lastly, is the GMAT or GRE required for admission to this school?   
Thanks for any input!

			Thanks so much Sandgrounder! 
So if I understand correctly, based on what you said:[LIST][*]Year 1 Kindergarten is Uk reception[*]Year 2  Kindergarten is UK year 1 of primary school.[*]In Switzerland, Kindergarten year 1 is not a full time education as it is in England with reception year.[*] Kindergarten year 2 is a full time education program.[*] all primary school years are full time education programs (same hours as Kindergarten)- .   
Are my assumptions correct?   
I have some more questions now    
What is considered full time education program in Switzerland. What time do they start and when do they finish? 
What times do part-time Kindergarten year 1 start and finish? 
Do all primary schools and Kindergartens offer chargeable after school care?   
Both myself and my husband work full time and need to make sure that our kids are taken care of during working days and hours. How realistic is this in Switzerland?    
Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!   
Many thanks once again!!!!!!!!!!

My daughter is now 3 1/2 year old. And I think its the right time that I can introduce her to read on her own. I am looking for your recommendation on different flash cards or books or apps or any other ideas that I can use to help her learn to read and have fun at the same time. I am thinking about the below two flash card sets from amazon.

			Thank you. We would like to start with German only to begin with as 4 languages can apparently cause a lot of confusion at such a young age and we want to avoid that, especially given the stress of the move and of leaving a place and nursery that she loves. There will be time to learn English during primary school, as you say plus we watch movies etc. in English. Any other suggestion on Montessori German nurseries is welcome. 
Thank you

			The CRUS site gives you pretty much all you need to know.  The question is what do you want to study and at what level.     
Study programmes in medicine (human medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine) and chiropractic as well as in human movement and sports sciences are restricted to people who are either Swiss/Lichtenstein nationals or have lived in Switzerland for a minimum of 5 years.   
Most of the Masters courses are taught in English, but Bachelors are not so if you don't speak a Swiss language (German, French, Italian), then doing a Bachelors here won't be possible.

			Actually, the local schools would be the almost perfect option for you.   
My kids are 9 and 6, and have been in Switzerland for the last 6 years. They are completely bilingual in French and English. The English they learnt at home and the French at school.   
The comment constantly made regarding their language skills is how they manage to have an English accent when speaking English and a Swiss French accent when speaking French. I don't think that would have happened if they had gone to an international school.

			if you have a masters degree recognizable in Europe you will be able to do a PhD in life sciences in CH. 
Otherwise, they might ask you to start again with a Master's 
A PhD is not legislated (anywhere as far as I know) in the same way as a physician's degree in medicine, because you won't be licensed to see and treat patients afterwards.

			Hi Everyone!   
I am hoping someone on here would have some advice for my family about the Herrliberg and Feldmeilen state schools (international schools not possible at the moment).   
I have a 9 year old daughter who will be starting 4th grade this year after summer holidays. We have two apartment options that will place my daughter into either the Herrliberg or Feldmeilen school, so I was hoping to get some inside info before making the important decision.   
We previously had a great experience at the Feldmeilen school, where my daughter attended kindergarten. However, I found there is now a new principal, German teacher, and all the other nice teachers we knew are now gone.    
For a short time my daughter went to a school in Kanton Aargau where we had an 'ok' to 'disappointing' experience. There was a lot of bullying, cliques, children cursing, name calling, and make rude gestures. My daughter is also slowly re-learning German/Swiss German as we moved out of CH for the last 2 years.   
 Any advice on this topic would be very much appreciated!   
Specific questions: 
1. What are the teachers/principal like? Are they friendly/rude/normal toward foreigners?  
2. Are the children nice? Have your children (as internationals) been able to make friends easily?  
3. What is the education quality like? I heard of a system in Rumikon state school where 4-6th grades are grouped together for all lessons, is this true of Herrliberg or Feldmeilen?   
 Thank you so so much for any feedback!   
(as a side note, if anyone on here with children around my daughter's age would be interested in meeting for a play-date this summer, we would be delighted! Please PM me and we can chat more. My daughter has become a bit insecure and shy this year after having bad friendship experiences at her last school.)

Sorry, do not have experience with the schools you mention.  If you really want an English school, the International school is the one most well known, and the LGB campus is on that side.  The other to consider, there is a Swedish school that is also Eng/Fr bilingual in that area.

			Exactly! What do you want to do?   
That degree does not sound like a qualifying law degree in the UK, such as Law and Criminology, although I do think the OU has a qualifying law degree. It is unlikely that a UK law degree would be very helpful if you wanted to be a lawyer in Switzerland.

Or the Jugendriege or swimming if he is more in to sport. Or Pfadi..Its really important that the kids joins one or two clubs. Its really the only way to get into the community quickly.   
The school pays for the transport to Allegra btw. He will have to go by public transport though.

As you know yourself, the Geneva area is home to some major international institutions incl. several NGOs and some NPOs, for which your degree might be most relevant.    
However, the Swiss education system works differently to that in e.g. Anglo-Saxon world, i.e. the university or institution is there to teach you, not to help you enter the workforce. The latter is your own responsibility and you will largely need to look for a job on your own with limited to no support from the institution.   
Also, I take it you're Armenian, please be aware that studying in Switzerland doesn't entitle you to continue to stay here after graduation and you have no higher priority than other non-EU job seekers. You do have a limited amount of time after graduation to look for a job, though, sufficient funding provided - it's usually six months.    
Last but not least, the labor market in Switzerland is generally pretty to very competitive and this field will be no exception. I can only support Medea's suggestion to try the internship route as early in your studies as possible.

			Have you looked at Obersee Bilingual School in Pfäffikon, SZ? Here the children are taught in both DE and Eng, reaching comparable or higher levels in other international schools.    
There is also a  high level of parent satisfaction with the school and teaching and all the children love going.    
Please let me know if you require any more information.

			Hi everyone! I would be grateful, if anyone can help me with the issue. I want to   do my master in  (INTERNATIONAL) DEVELOPMENT STUDIES in Geneva - in the heart of international organisations capital. Thus, I wonder  
1. is it a good idea to study in Geneva on that topic? 
2. is it possible to find a job after my studies in Geneva?    
Thanks in advance for your time and support.

			in migros school they teach in a batch to 10 to 15 people. 
Hence teacher can´t look at you personally. 
If you do not go to school for a single day you miss what teacher taught to the class. 
Where as   is a one to one school with alot of practice and conversation in groups. Each lesson contains reading, hearing, specking, writing and many exercises. You choose your time to go to school as you are the only one in your batch,. 
Its really unique and it works great.

I'm more worried about how they don't send you physical paperwork with actual deadlines for your decision and things of that nature.... and whenever I try to look online they do not have specific dates for when you should notify them of your decision etc...

			Switzerland is a lovely place, you will most likely enjoy living here. 
I agree that you would probably have to work for one of the international schools to teach English, perhaps in the EAL (English as an Additional Language) department, providing support to kids whose mother tongue is not English. 
You could also teach Arabic as an after-school club to kids who speak it but perhaps need an extra push.  Many international schools offer mother-tongue clubs. 
Finally, you could advertise your services and offer private lessons...however not sure if you can make a living out of this alone. 
Best of luck!

Also, each University has their own admissions requirements and since you didn't specify which Universities you wanted to apply to, it would be a lengthy procedure for us to list all the requirements  But perhaps you could give us the exact places you wanted to apply to and ask things you could not find on their websites.

			If it can help.   
My Spanish teacher comes to my house or I go to hers or we go out in coffees or even shopping. I am with her since one year at an average of 3 times per week. My Spanish level is now B1.    
I could be much higher if it wasn't my busy mom's life with two young kids. Still she thinks it is very impressive what I manage to learn in this past year. We work with books, CDs, Internet, videos, fashion and gossips magazines and what is going on in the actuality, my life, her life. Our relationship is more than teacher-student as she is also a very close friend. We spent Christmas with both our family together.    
Her teaching style is amazing and very effective. She has a master degree in business Spanish and is working on her Doc. I am one of her laboratory rat on who she tests her teaching's methods and it works.   
The teacher I had before her was useless. Her method was to follow the books and only that. Conversations were focus on the exercise we were doing and that's it. My husband is still with her as it is paid by the company and sadly, he didn't improved much.    
The key is conversation, conversation and more conversation.

I mean, maybe Rod Stewart had recently raped the Doctor's wife or something, or sued him for malpractice.  Or maybe the Doctor calls everyone a see you next Tuesday.  Or has coprolalia.  The twat.   
But even simple things like two people chatting and ""Where the hell have you been?"" - it depends on the tone of voice and the friendship.

			I'm not sure if that course exists in Switzerland or not. If so I doubt it would be offered in English. Some masters course are offered in English, but generally Science type courses. However even if the course was offered in English, you would need to speak the local language (Swiss German in Basel) to get a job working with local children.

The tariff to get into a Swiss university with an IB Diploma is high because the majority of Swiss universities (pretty much like most countries around the world) believe that their own examination system is the greatest in history. Whether it is or not is neither here nor there, it is what the universities demand that is ""the law"". Therefore the requirements for the Maturite are lower than those for other examination systems.   
The truth of the matter is that the maturite is an examination system which has evolved as the minimum requirement to get into university in Switzerland. It is as simple as that.   
The idea that the Maturite is equivalent to 11 A Levels is laughable. Are you seriously suggesting that students in Switzerland are so much better prepared, harder working and focused than their university going counterparts in the UK? By and large, most examination systems the world over are fairly equal and their isn't that much of a difference between them.

I wonder if anyone is familiar with specific regulations of HEC Lausanne. For example, I got a refusal from St. Gallen University because  my Master's degree is not in the same field as my  Bachelor's /  Specialist's degree, therefore my academic history was not assessed as equivalent to their consecutive Master's degrees according to their legal regulations. 
Perhaps anybody was admitted to HEC Lausanne and knows their rules.

Under the Swiss system, my daughter will have to spend her days after 11.30 at Hort except 1-2 afternoons. I simply have the bad conscious for not being able to take care of her.    
I have gone through the SIS website and am extremely happy to learn that the kids are being looked after till 4 pm plus 2 additional hours of supervision as an option, which seems to be a great relief. I am also happy to learn that both German and English are taught and that the school actually follows the Zurich canton standards.    
Another added benefit is costs....if I am to work 100%, I will anyway need to pay CHF 1.5-1.8K for the horte, which is not a lot less than what SIS charges, at least this the case until the end of Primarschule.   
I have read mixed reviews posted a few years ago about SIS. Some parents are happy while others think the school does not really care too much about kids if they have, say language difficulties.  I am wondering whether there are any recent experiences with SIS Wallisellen. I am also interested in any experiences on the student or teacher's background and turnover.

			Look on  
They do holiday courses and some after school and weekend schemes. 
All in english, I think they do courses for kids as young as yours.     
Also try searching MUKI and putting in towns near to where you are living, something may come up.  This is P.E/gym for kids with an adult also taking part/helping.  I think kids up to starting Kindergarten are allowed to go.

			You are generally not allowed to take up (paid) work on an F or N permit, but you can submit a request to local authorities for them to allow you to work. They may or may not grant that and there may or may not be restrictions (e.g. canton, industry).    
Be aware that for any given job, an employer has to prove that he can't find an a) Swiss citizen, b) C or B permit (unrestricted) holder, c) EU/EFTA citizen and d) non-EU citizen to do said job before they can consider an asylum seeker/refugee. To be very upfront, this alone is highly unlikely in the field you are interested in.   
Generally, banking is a specialist and typically high-skilled industry where it will prove difficult to impossible to find employment without proper education/training. You will first need to obtain a high school diploma (credentials you may have from your home country may count towards that, but likely not completely), then either do an apprenticeship or go to university. Fluency in at least one national language will be a requirement no matter what on the professional level that is relevant for you. It may matter less for an exec and indeed many don't speak any local language, but it will impossible for you to a) do an apprenticeship or go to uni and b) get an entry-level position in pretty much any field including banking without speaking the local language.   
It is a long way to go, which I hope doesn't hold you back.    
All the best.     
P.S. It actually is possible that you get a B permit, it depends on your case, and if you get one, it will be for one year and likely restricted.

			University of St. Gallen has recently started teaching bachelor programs in English,  , though you do need to take 2 courses in German prior to completion. No science options, however, but international affairs is offered.    
My impression is that double majoring in a science and an unrelated other subject wouldn't be possible in a Swiss university - unless you want to do them sequentially.    
Lots of masters programs in science offered in English, however.

			I agree with the other posters  - it's near impossible.   
 Another reason would be your child having special needs that cannot be met in their current school. Severe bullying, that has evidence from a doctor in support of you would also be considered.    
I once heard of someone paying the fees (c.a. 10,000 Fr PA) to the new school but this is not usually an option either.    
You will need a lot of good luck here.

			Is there any scholarship?   
LOL, At the university level,  I surely hope so!  :   
schol·ar·ship  (skŏl′ər-shĭp′) 
n. 
1. The methods, discipline, and attainments of a scholar or scholars. 
2. Knowledge resulting from study and research in a particular field.   
Ah, wait, you must have meant:   
3. A grant of financial aid awarded to a student, as for the purpose of attending a college.   
In which case, one would ask, ""Are there any scholarships?"" or better yet ""Do you happen to know if they offer any scholarships?""   
As a native English speaker (I'm making an assumption, but you have stated that you are from the US), you should know better...especially when inquiring about academic scholarships!   
I commend you on your efforts - joining the forum, asking questions, etc. However, I recommend that you don't become reliant on others to source your information.  You could easily check the website, send an email, make a phone call, or otherwise show interest to the school itself. (As opposed to asking a third party, who has already tried to be of help, for more info...)   
You can lead a horse to water, .....

			We visited both and they each have a different vibe. Best to visit and see where you feel more comfortable. One difference to consider is that ICS only has the IB system when they reach the upper years. ZIS has both the IB and AP systems.  
ZIS did not have a place for my older son. Unfortunately, they were not very kind to him when they explained this. They misunderstood his requirements and once that was cleared up, they changed their tune, but it left a bad taste in our minds.  
Fortunately for us ICS had room and our sons both liked the school. We have been there for three years and very happy. The school has been a great experience for our children and given them strengths that they would not have developed in the States. 
I hope this helps.

I think it is myopic from the school(s) to let this wonderful opportunity go. One loses a semester/is behind a year...big deal! But the person gets to live, experience, learn in a different culture. And be with their family, experience as a family. There is really no argument there IMO.   
I hope that something can be worked out, I am not at all surprised about difficulties in ZH (=the rules above all) but I am surprised that nothing can be worked out/figured out with the CA school district...What would California care if you homeschool your kids for 3 months, even a full academic year?

			Also, a really good thing is that there are good links for kids who go into an apprenticeship to then get back into more academic studies later and get to University. I know several here who have done this very succesfully, who at 15 didn't make the 'academic- grade for one reason or another.

			UK 'second best education in Europe'   
Global education rankings, which include higher education as well as international school tests, are headed by South Korea, with the UK in sixth place.   
Read more:     
My first reaction when I see polls like this is who is sleeping with whom. Where does Pearson sell more textbooks (and revision guides) maybe? UKs higher ranking attributed to increasing numbers entering university - no mention of increasing debt and youth unemployment (19% last I checked). CH has comparatively very low numbers entering university, but rather paid apprenticeships and technical colleges/universities - youth unemployment ~ 4%.

Normally the Tagesschulen in the canton Bern are open for max. 7 hours a day, during 39 school weeks. Another reason might be that the costs for food are lower than in the KiTa, due to the fact that they normally offer just lunch and ""Zvieri"". Some of them even distinguish between the students of the kindergarten and the one of the primary school. But this varies from town to town because the local school boards or the towns fix the prices independently.

			I don't live in Luzern, I live in canton ZG, but if you are applying to the local swiss school I think the procedure is pretty similar canton to canton.       
When you move there and register with the Gemeinde (Town Hall), they will see that you have school age children and will assign them places in the local school.      
I would say that at the start of the next school year (August 2014) that your eldest would be going into the First Class of the Primary School and that your youngest will be too young for Kindergarten and would have to wait until August 2015 to start. (That's how it would be if you were in ZG).

I'm sure we would miss some (many) aspects of life here too. Some will be subtle and we'll only figure it out after having lived there for a while. There are parts of Switzerland where housing is certainly cheaper, but they tend to be more remote of course. Being close to Zürich and a lot of international people keeps things socially bearable    
I think we'll not rush into any decisions but we'll see how our feelings run, and maybe when we're in the UK on holiday during the summer, we'll make a few discrete enquiries and get some more concrete ideas of how our life would be there compared to here.

830	06.05.2014, 08:48	Junior Member	Thanked 2 Times in 1 Post	Location: Geneva	"    Pretty much that - they will be inside the main primary school (going up to age 12/13) and will share certain classes (eg sport, craft and design).  The idea is that the core subjects at this age (French maths and foreign languages (German and English)) will be taught in this group and as much as possible for other classes they will integrate - and indeed depending on the child, they will have the option of integrating for any of the mainstream classes where appropriate, and particularly as a precursor to joining the mainstream schooling full time.   
The view we are taking is that we are a small canton and have limited resources, so far better to gather together some really specialised teachers in one spot who have the resources to teach these children in the unusual ways that often reap huge rewards rather then dispersing them throughout the school system and having very little access to anything specialised.   
My son currently has a brilliant primary teacher who teaches him one to one for up to 2.5 hours a day (even though he is still in enfantine so should not be getting any formalised teaching at all).  They use all the usual autism supports (TEACHH, PECS, various French language apps conceived for autistic children) as are appropriate for the children and from what we can see, the teacher pays very little attention to what the cantonal curriculum otherwise tells him he should be teaching, instead following my son's ""emerging skills"".  The downside is that my son is currently in a special school to access this but given the size of the Canton, this actually amounts to only 6 children with similar needs each with an individualised daily plan which incorporates lots of intensive therapy as well - so for now and for his level of needs, it's working brilliantly.  But I can see this ""integration"" class (if it ever gets set up  ) would be an ideal next step in a couple of years.

			Hi,   
Are you looking at FCP or FCPX?  Are you wanting to do it professionally or as a hobby?  And do you have to software yet?   
There are lots of places online to get assitance with the software, youtube has videos on how to set up a project, and then I found the best thing to do was to just start playing around.   
I use creativecow if I have a problem, chances are if you have an issue with something someone else has also had that problem and a solution is a quick search away.       
If you go for a course, I think it would be worth having a play around before you start any course as a basic grasp will be a huge advantage.

Here are some more infos:       it can be an advantage to have your certificate recognised here so that employers know the level of your competence/qualifications, especially if your certificate was issued in a non-EU country.

			Dear All,     
I have posted before on this topic but I am trying again.     
My family is English and my 2 boys attend the local Swiss school here in St Sulpice, which is great.   However,  we are concerned that now they are not learning English (until much later on) and are therefore considering private tuition for them.     
Therefore, I am seeking recommendations for private tutors and/or English schools any experiences anyone has.   We would obviously prefer for them to be taught by a native English speaker.     
Thanks in advance, 
Jennifer

			Personally, unless it really is a great opportunity for your husband, for 2 years I wouldn't move. If it was for you to stay until your kids move onto University (if they want to) I would be much more for it (particularly with the lower fees).   
I don't want to sell short how this can really be an opportunity to have a huge amount of self-growth (for all of you), moving abroad can really broaden your horizons. 
But it can also backfire spectacularly and there's a total of 5 of you, I wouldn't be surprised to have it backfire for at least one of you.   
You can learn a foreign language without moving 2 years abroad, you just have to put in the effort (and it requires discipline, the moving abroad just sort of forces you so you don't need to have the discipline).   
It may be a great opportunity or a specific dream your husband has, given he is trying to convince you. 
I think at that institution workers don't pay taxes so the salary is probably pretty stellar, and maybe something really good to have in his CV.   
But to be fair if you are a stay at home spouse, from other threads I have read, one of your kids/you likely will be the ones that are going to experience the most negative aspects of the move - not him (he probably can get away easily without learning German very well etc., he will automatically be inserted in the Bank with lots of colleagues in the same situation as he is and so on). So it is ""fair"" for you to be a bit ""selfish"" and present significant arguments against moving.   
To the husband if you read this, please don't hate me  
It is also perfectly fair for him to ask about it and try to convince you   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2014	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	US to Basel w/ Elementary school aged kids, special needs...	"""starfish3"	Posts: 7	2,245	13	Education

			I'm not sure what the question is....   
In Zurich, there are two years of compulsory kindergarten, prior to the first 'primary school' year....   
I don't know what the difference is between 'vorschule' and 'kindergarten'...if there is one... At my kids (Montessori) school, children who are under the official primary school age but doing an early year in the primary class (which is mixed age 6-9 year olds) are classified as 'vorschule' for convenience, as they are not located physically in the ""kinderhaus"" with the 0-6 year olds.  Those children will end up doing an extra year of primary school so that they eventually end up transitioning to secondary schooling in the correct age cohort...

I don't know if this is something he would ever consider, but what about going to a junior college for the first 2 years?

			The title of the thread is wrong, it's not about France and Germany: it should read Romandie vs. Alemanic Switzerland.    
The systems and the ""culture"" in schools differ more between Geneva and Fribourg than between Vaud and Bern. Language border is not everything. It is actually almost nothing. For outsiders, it's all the same eventually, even if each canton has its own odd things and even some gems. In recent years, the systems of Jura and Basel BL/BS have been coordinated quite well. F.ex. the bilingual Laufen/Porrentruy gymnasium exchange is a huge hit as well as the bilingual ""bridge"" primary school in Delémont.

			Wondering if anyone has any recommendations for schools or teachers (in the Zurich area) specifically related to business German?   
A bit of a special case, as I have been speaking Swiss German since I've started talking and am at an intermediate/advanced level; my formal German, however, is lacking.  Having taken a number of German courses leads me to believe (and been confirmed by the teachers) that my needs cannot be met by attending a normal German course, and I should search for individual lessons to specifically focus on translating my knowledge of Swiss German to written German.  I've contacted a number of schools (Klubschule, Bellingua, Benedict, Berliz) but don't feel intrigued or particularly confident in any of them.     
Appreciate if anyone has any personal experience they would like to share or a teacher they would recommend for this?  Thanks in advance for reading.

A friend of mine is paying CHF 50/half-hour for piano lessons for her 6-year-old. Those are both private lessons. 
For piano lessons through the Gemeinde (they subsidize), we paid CHF 760 for one semester.

All the information is there.   
This is an internationally recognised degree (ISCED 5A), as are all bachelors and masters degrees from traditional universities and Universities of Applied Sciences. CAS and MAS qualifications do not have this recognition (they are ISCED 5B, which means tertiary but not university).   
If you are not qualified for this, there are entrance exams on 14 to 16 April. See the web page.

			You need to decide where you are going to live first.  The last thing you want to do is cross a bridge during the school run.   
If you are looking at the Left Bank, Notre Dame de Lac is a very good private school.  Teaches in French.  My eldest and 4 of her cousins go there.     
My main gripe with Geneva schools is they are very French in teaching style, so children learn by wrote and are not encouraged to think for themselves.   
If you are thinking of having your child prepare for the International Bac, then the Ecole International is very good.   
If you have the money and want your child to leave school very well connected, then when she is older Le Rosey is a very good boarding school.   
Hope this helps.

			Hi   
Admittedly I am jumping on your thread with a similar issue! We are already in Vaud and my 10 year old is at International School. We have the choice of relocating to UK or staying here and opting for local school.    
I wonder if there is any way of getting comparisons between local schools - we are quite prepared to move to ensure he goes to a school with the maximum level of support - his french is very very basic (no thanks to the International School!)

			The main thing to consider is travel times to work from wherever you choose to live. I work in Altstetten and was commuting 2hrs door to door from Basel Claraplatz.   
We took the decision to move in early 2010 as I got fed up of the lengthy commute - especially arriving home in the evening only in time for my young son starting bedtime.   
We concentrated our search around Altstetten, Albisrieden, and up towards Höngg as being within a bike ride of work, having plenty of green but also being close enough to the city centre to be able to participate in any social life.   
Like you, my Homegate searches came up with places that had lengthy waiting lists etc. But the key was to review the search results each day - and several times a day - and to be quick off the mark with arranging viewings. We. Were also prepared to be a little bit flexible with the apartment itself - e.g. The kitchen is a bit on the small side and the apartment overall is in need of modernisation but it's still okay. I was also very sad to give up the huge rooftop balcony we had in Basel   The important thing is a 5min commute to work and the apartment is situated in an area which is away from traffic and there are parks and play areas that my son can get to without having to cross a road.   
The place we got was being vacated by a couple who were doing a lifestyle change and wanted to find a ""nachmieter"" to take over the place before the 3 months notice period. As the decor is a bit dated, plus the place is only really suitable for a family they did not get a lot of people interested in the apartment. And the rental company were keen to get a family in plus my having a steady job helped.   
Uster is quite nice and has good connections to Zurich. Also consider other places along the lake - Wädenswil, Horburg, Thalwil - as you may get a little more for your money.   
I assumed we would be looking for years, but in fact from the time we started until the time we moved was a matter of a few months.   
The other thing we decided was we were prepared to take a place that maybe is not ideal, but in Zurich as once you are living in the place, you can take time to decide which areas of Zurich you like and then look for your ideal place. This was especially true for us as our son was a toddler, and my wife working, and arranging for my wife to come out to Zurich for a viewing at the drop of a hat from Basel midweek was not so easy.   
Cheers, 
Nick

			Hey everyone,    
Thanks for the answers and suggestions. I was only curious to see what I would be facing if I were to try to apply simply because it looked like a good opportunity to get an MA here as I'm already in the country.   
I did do my research, I do know how bleak it would be. I simply wanted to hear from others' experiences and general knowledge.

yes, Lycée Pareto opened in Mies and also Aubonne. I think that kids start there at 14-15 year old. 
Rivermania, have you chosen this school finally?

			Hi there,   
My little princess will go in Aug to primary school and we have got an option to send her to ADL class, where kids from three different age groups are together, meaning class level 1, 2 & 3. 
Do you have experience with this kind of system? Please share your opinion.   
cheers,

			Very few French and German teachers in the UK are native speakers of those languages- many are excellent teachers, even though they do not speak those languages fluently- some are not- some are both excellent teachers and excellent speakers of those languages. Few are native speakers, and among those, some are excellent teachers, and some definitely are not  same as here, really.   
To teach in state schools in CH, you have to be qualified as a teacher (same in the UK- although Gove is trying hard to stop this)- knowing how to teach is often more important than the ability in the subject- I'd say, depending on the level, although both is great   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Jan 2013	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	English Lessons in local school, native speakers	"""swisscanmom"	Posts: 612	1,326	5	Education

back on topic.   
there are quite a few preschools and schools that call themselves bilingual in the area. my best advice is to do a bit of googling and visit them. in terms of language, don't worry too much about the security of it at this age- look more importantly for helpful and warm staff and a environment you like. the language will certainly come quickly.

			completely agree with the last post. my kindergarten boy is just five, he is begging to walk alone, i am holding him back but he h as to do half the journey alone and we watch. he crosses at the zebra crossing alone. we have been training since august. he wears his reflective band thing, and all the people stop for him even it it means they have to wait a bit they will stop as they know we are training. he is the only one at this end of e school, all the other children go in a children taxi, which is one parent and about 15 children trudging home. the parent is only for the little ones, the 6-7 year olds go off on their own. i do know of people who were fined for dropping off their children. a car is a big no no, it is dangerous for the other kids walking... i have had to overcome my british paranoia and let my kids go in a way. they climb trees, and fall off again, come home with all number of scrapes, the garden is textured, i.e. no grass just stones and sticks!!! they carry pocket knives, build fires, and grill sausages every monday in the forest...they are out in all weathers, i get yelled at if i don't pack the waterproof trousers in the school bag! all in all their TV time is maybe 1 hour on a sunday morning, otherwise they are out in the forest, in the parks and god knows where else enjoying themselves! it is a culture shock but definitely for the better. and no, they don't have phones   "	null	null	null	Questions about primary schools and university	guest	null	7,913	135	Education

			Really, apart from having to learn german and occasionally having someone laugh at you for saying das instead of der, it's not that difficult adapting to the swiss culture. The people here behave differently I suppose, but not different in a bad way. I come from a small village in England and am now living in Bern, so I think that is more likely the reason for the change in behavior rather than the move to Switzerland its self.

			Hello   
My family is relocating to Geneva this summer and we think we will not get a choice of place in the 3 Ecolint campuses and more likely to get a place at LGB than any other.   
Annoyingly (isnt it typical) we visited both Nations (1st choice) and Le Chat when we visited but not LGB as I hadnt heard great things about it.   
Does anyone have any secondary school experience and could share some wise words? You know what its like- I want everythign to be lovely for my 15 year old daughter - but its very hard not having actually been there!   
I've heard it feels quite overwhelmingly huge!

			Thanks a lot Swisspea for the details.  
The dates for arrival have not yet been finalised, but we are looking for a place from August onwards, and plan to stay for the foreseeable future. We have tried the schools you mentioned, and the others on the AMS website except for the Dubendorf one so far. We prefer a bilingual school with full daycare 5 days a week, although to start with a half day/fewer days per week is also fine with us. What do the schools prefer? There wasn't much they mentioned on what would help secure a place or what sort of flexibility from our side would help.  
Our house hunt would also be dependent on the school location, as we would prefer something close by.   
If May is the decider, then I guess we would postpone the house hunt until then - but is it at the start of May or the end that the schools would have a clearer picture? Coz even the house hunt wouldn't be easy or quick I think!

			Thanks very much for this Melone and Amaraya. Option 2 sounded a bit intimidating so it's good to hear your advice.    
Of course, our situation is a bit different since we'll return to Canada after 1y. The CREAL organizers recommend option 1 if learning French is the only goal -- but feel that option 2 could work, and would be better for assimilation as Amaraya says.   
You've both made me feel better about the social/academic environment of CREAL (options 1 and 2).

			I encourage you and your son to also consider international schools.  
ICSZ offers a ""British"" type of education. Exams lead to International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma which is very widely recognized by universities in UK / US.  
ZIS offers both AP exams (Advanced Placement) or IB. AP is also very widely recognized, tends to be more ""American"". 
Tertiary education establishments look highly upon both AP and IB. I have known many students who have had much success following achievement in these exams.  
ISZN offers A-levels, so definitely worth checking out too.

			There is also the French primary school in Basel, somewhere in Skt Alban. Very good reputation.   
Be careful about Delemont, the bilingual sections is meant to make the transition possible for German speaking Basler, but the goal is still to get those student to become Romand students. The language issue is explosive in Jura, don't have false hope, it is and will do every thing to stay a French speaking everything. Incl your children on middle term.

			The labeling for the grades are not necessarily consistent with the academic expectations. So how do you know that grade 2 in Switzerland is not equivalent to grade 3 in Finland, for example....or regardless of that, if your kids are going to transfer back to the uk or whatever, the uk will look at the child's age and then assess their academic level in English, and quite likely disregard whatever grading they had in Switzerland.    
In canton Zürich, compulsory schooling starts with kindergarten 1&2 prior to primary school, so a total of 8 years before secondary school. Then 6 or 7 years of secondary schooling to get to a matura, or 3 years of secondary then they start an apprenticeship and continue studying for at least another 3 years.    
However, back to the original question, our two older kids are/were at D'Insle Montessori and we have been very pleased, but they were in Montessori in Australia first, so the method and lessons, expectations etc were similar, just the addition of Swiss-German, high-German and French, gymnastics and swimming were the big new experiences for them.    
Our eldest is in the second year of Sek in the A stream, and our second child will sit the test for the gymnasium on Monday. He will either go to gymnasium if he gets a place, or the sek A like his sister.    
At the Montessori school they can move children who are 6 into the primary school class, but officially they are still graded as ""pre-school"" under the Swiss system. The general expectation would be that the child is reading and writing, albeit as a beginner, eg. Can write their name, can write some words, can read 3-4 letter words, and using the Montessori materials to be able to do all four operations in maths...and is functionally independent - able to express their needs, independent with clothing, toileting, changing for sport, able to manage their own belongings...  Academically the grade levels  are not really relevant as Montessori teachers work with each individual child and progress them regardless of specific grades. Our eldest did an extra year in upper primary, our middle child did an extra year of lower primary and our youngest has done an extra 3/4 year of kindergarten, to bring them to the normal age range for Swiss secondary school. That is compared to the age cut offs for the australian system, which also runs on a January-December school year. If we were to transfer them back now, we would not be in a hurry to accelerate them up the grades. They have never been bored or repeated anything, just expanded their learning and matured.    
However, as a caveat, if your children have not been in Montessori before, it can be a big change for some children. The level of independent learning, and the fact that there are no grades or exams, and the high expectations that the child can do their work with minimal adult supervision/checking over their shoulder, the freedom to socialize in the classroom, can be hard for some kids coming from a much more traditional environment. The child who succeeds in Montessori primary school has to be self-motivated, not motivated by reward and punishments or teacher approval. They also have to be able to get on with their work without getting to distracted. Normally they offer a week or two of short visits, and you can tell very quickly if the child is going to fit in with the class and expectations or not. If the first few days/weeks are very difficult, it does not usually get easier...

			Hello everyone,  
Just as an update - we met our son's Grade 6 teacher yesterday and had a detailed discussion after which she has agreed to give him 4-5 weeks to better his Math scores from 4 to 4.5-5 on average so she can reconsider her decision. She was very happy with his 4.75 average in German though( just from being at local school for under 2 years).  
In the meantime we are hopeful that with a little help from his Math tutor he will have a more confident approach towards Math in the next few tests. 
We should have another meeting before May. Keeping our fingers crossed and thank you all for the valuable information. Feeling positive    
Have a lovely weekend.

			Hi there   
I am currently 16 years old (The same girl on the post linked above) and I moved to Switzerland when I was pretty much 15. I personally, really didn't want to learn german. I am a person used to being at the top of the class and i wanted to stay there. But my parents had a different idea. They put me into the gymnasium straight away. I didnt manage it and after three weeks i was out. However, i then decided myself to effectively take a year out of the schooling system and go to a language school. I learnt intesively every day. After a month of this we went back to the kreisebüro and asked what my options were. They were very kind and said i could unnofficially visit the local secondary school for the 5 hours a day when I wasn't at the language school. (I live in the city 8006). At the beginning school was difficult. My grades were sloppy and I was only understanding about half of what was going on in the class, maybe less. But by the end of the first semester, I had friends who I communicated with only in German and I was consistently passing my exams, even some of the German grammar ones  . The thing I found about learning german the way i did, was that I gained a very good knowledge of the grammar and therefore, was almost on par with the class within 5 months. Moving on, by the end of the year, i was b2 standard and pretty much understanding everything.   
This year I started gymasium again, and with huge success, I am happy to say. I got some of the highest grades in my year group and I learnt swiss german this semester. You pick it up incredibly quickly once you speak german and are surrounded by it. i do not speak swiss german but that is completely by choice, i understand all that is said to me.    
My point it this, if you are willing to put in the time and effort, and your children are smart enough, which by the sounds of things, they are, then it is well worth it. Yes I am now a year behind where i would be if i was still in England but, because people in switzerland can go into gymnasium at varied ages, I am not by far the oldest in my class. There are people vurging on 17 and people who are only 14 in the same class in gymnasium here. (MNG Rämibühl). The swiss system is a fantastic schooling system. Having experienced myself both the english and the american school system beforehand i can safely say that the swiss system is the best. It is very well rounded and the teachers are incredibly supportive and teach at a high standard throughout. I strongly suggest putting your children in the local school, and if needed, sending them to a language school on the side. The older ones, if they manage german, will then be able to go to the kurzgymnasium (4 years long). The 13 year old may even be able to get a place as an auditer for his/her first year in gymnasium if s/he has only been in switzerland one year when he/she enters, because then it can hardly be expected that s/he can be ready to sit the exam after only half a year. I was also given this option and the outcome is just that the grades dont count for your first half a year of gymnasium and then you start getting evaluated. It helps an awful lot to let your child settle in.   
I was 2 years older and I managed it.

			Hmm, no good stuff.  OK.  I will give you distinguishing features, good and/or bad.  I know people with kids in each of these. And all are happy but none see their school as perfect.  Really, you can't go wrong with any but each are different animals.   
Montana. A boarding school that is trying to diversify into a day school with some success and some not.  They forgot when they did that the parents are an extension of kids everyday lives and must be communicated with. Their IB program isn't integrated w/ their local curriculum program so while it may seem the campus is large the student body itself is split. Lots of money on the hill. No bus service. No pool access for swimming classes. Your son can take the local curriculum program in German and learn the language but not be in the swiss local school (stating facts here people, don't groan at me and argue about choosing local school for language and integration)   
ISOCS. No bus service. Does have swimming.  Haven't heard anything bad about the management of the school. Having turnover in the middle school (way past age 7!) right now due to a teacher leaving but that is normal in CH, people come and go all the time. And its a small school so when one person leaves it is a big deal. Seems to have up and coming prestige in the Swiss International School community and is growing quickly.   
ISZL. Huge with all the benefits that comes with a big school. Has bus service.  Has it's own social group for parents so it is a ready made social network if that is what you are looking for to ease your transition to CH. A kid attending this school can find all they need in the way of extracurricular activities. They even have Girl Scouts. Has swimming. And as with a larger school there are more opportunities for management problems and I am aware of some...     
All three use the IB curriculum so they should be learning the same stuff. My kid goes to one of these schools, but I am not telling which ;-) You can PM me. It all comes down to how much you want your son to integrate and how much you rely on the school to be your social circle, how important German language is to the family, and if you like small personal groups or large groups with a plethora of offerings, clubs and social opportunities. I think I have given you a balanced summary of what I know of each school.

Depending on age, children have the same amount of afternoon sessions.  My son's class is split into two groups and, due to the nature of the afternoon activities, the two groups have their afternoon school on different days.  I like this system because the teacher then can concentrate on a small group of 8 kids for certain periods during the week.   
For the remainder of the time, we rely on the after-school care which is open till 6.30pm to take care of him on the days he has no school because I work.

			It sounds like your daughter would benefit from a Steiner education especially if conventional schooling isn't working.  
 I'm fluent in Swiss German so I managed to communicate using that, however, I had to learn most of my high German from scratch during my time there. Grammatically my essays were atrocious so the teachers would often help me after class with basic structure and things like that. I remember some of the other foreign students had extra German lessons after school to catch up and I had extra French lessons during lunch time with a few others who had never learnt French before. 
 If your daughter already has a basic grasp of German I don't think it would take long for her to be fluent. The fastest way to fluency is to just to immerse yourself in the language, reading in German and trying to talk as much German as possible. I found most of my class mates really supportive, helping me to translate and understand more complex ideas in class. The hardest classes for me were naturally physics and chemistry, just because the German used to teach those subjects wasn't the stuff that is usually found on a vocab list  
 I would recommend a visit to the school to check it out for yourself and maybe talk to a few teachers, that way you can see if it feels right   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Feb 2012	Groaned at 4 Times in 3 Posts	Steiner Atelier Schule	"""Tasebo"	Posts: 1,195	1,668	4	Education

In all honesty and with today's pressure on permits, you're better off looking for companies in Germany.  Are there companies in Germany that do business with your home country, for example?  That might be an advantage for you.

			I don't live in Basel but I know SIS very well as I have worked with them in the past. I have three children who all went through the international system.    
The decision for you younger child depends a little on how long you will stay in Switzerland.    
One thing to consider is that SIS follows the Swiss curriculum. A great curriculum but not something to choose if you will only stay for three years or so. We always knew we would not stay longer than a few years and with all the moves, we decided very early to put out children into the international system.   
The language support in both systems in great and even if your younger son speaks no German at all at the moment, he will learn it fast, there is no doubt about that. SIS is usually more attended by Swiss or long term families, another thing to consider. Great if you are also long term, not so good and more difficult if you are a short term family.   
And finally, I find that the overall support for families, so both students and parents, is much better in the international schools.

			Thank you all so much for your input. We will be enrolling my daughter in extra curricular activities soonest. I did actually already speak to the people at the local kriesburo/community centre to ascertain what support they could provide/what suggestions they had for us as to what we could do ourselves. They basically suggested that I should not worry too much but after I pushed them a little they gave me the phone number of the head teacher of the school she will be attending in Aug (the KG teacher had told me which school my daughter would be going to in Aug) and asked me to discuss matters directly with him/her.    
I was a little hesitant at first as I didn't want the KG teacher to find out that I was sort of elevating matters (not to annoy her of course but only to do what was best for my daughter) but then I just called him. I politely explained the situation, as a concerned parent. He understood and said he would first need to discuss matters with the KG teacher (to learn more about the issue) before being able to discuss further with me. I await his call this week.

			There is a relatively new   at the University of St. Gallen that can be taken almost entirely in English. You  would need to take to German while you are at university and then take at least two courses in German. Whether you can get in depends a lot on what type of secondary school qualification you have so find their page on admissions requirements. This is a very challenging program from what I have heard and many students don't pass the first year. There are also a few English language bachelor programs in the UASs. I think I remember one in Bern.   
If you are looking for a Master's Degree, there are   in English.   
If you get accepted to one of these courses, you should be able to get a student visa.

If you think your child would be interested please contact me. I thought perhaps the first time parents could go along and then see how things go. And then maybe arrange things like ice skating, Alpa Mare, bowling, football or whatever they like.

			I contacted my professor directly. Sometimes you just need a bit of luck (as always). If you have one or two good publication it will definitely increase your chance, and write down whatever conferences you attended. Otherwise you need to express why exactly you want to work in his/her group. Contact him anytime eventhough no position is written on the web. I was told there was no position the first time I contacted my professor, and was then accepted one year afterward when I contacted him again.   
They might be applying for some funding, or just got a Postdoc/ scientific member and are thinking of getting new students.   
They got hundreds of emails per day, so it will also be helpful if you can identify the postdoc who is leading the project, and cc the postdoc in your email to the professor.    
From master level onward everything will mostly be in English.

			I will repeat what others have said before me. Only do a Ph.D. if you really want to (for the research, the subject matter), and not for the perceived benefits of having done one.   
Even shorter, European-style, Ph.D.s can be grueling. At some point, everyone hits a snag in their research and you need to love it enough and be tough enough mentally to withstand that time.    
And, in some fields, it is actually a disadvantage to have a Ph.D. instead of a master's if you want to get a certain kind of industry job. I have no idea what your field is like.

			ritshirt2001, that sounds like a fantastic idea! I'm definitely going to look into that. So far in my quest of looking into studying internationally/abroad, I have been pretty consumed by all the reading, especially since each school has variations in their international student policies, admissions requirements, programs, etc. Thus, I haven't yet ventured into Geneve, Basel, or Zurich... But I will.   Thanks! I have to say, I like UNIL though - it's not as high profile as EPFL, nor as populated as some of the schools in Zurich... Plus, I speak English and French, so am less inclined towards the German-speaking Swiss cities...   
Mélusine, I see what you're saying, but don't really know how I would go about letting my home uni and the Swiss university ""communicate officially""? The formal application to UNIL doesn't ask for equivalences for my Bachelor degrees. From what I can understand the administration fee (200 chf) for International Students' applications is going towards UNIL checking this process out for themselves.

			Thanks for your reply. I just found out the first offers are released around 14th Feb, it is a bit too early to worry about them. I think ~May release it for EU students who do not need a visa.

			Hello,   
Am looking at kindergarten options for my son next summer and am hesitating between the Montessori school by museum Rietberg and the Bilingual International School of Zurich in Sihlcity.   
Would any of you have experiences about either school to share with me or have a recommendation?   
Please feel free to send a PM or call me on [removed]   
Many thanks, Claire

Clearly, you have been lucky and did not come from an area where there is rampant kidnapping of children for child trafficking. This is where my concern came from. It is something that many people have been fortunate enough to not even worry about. It seems Switzerland is a safe heaven where this matter should not be of any concern despite Basel being very close to France and Germany.    
You've made valid points on the others which is enlightening re: Swiss culture. I can see you've been thanked enough.

My impression is that you are only looking at boarding schools and International School of Geneva is a day school only. Not sure where the comment about its reputation relative to CDL comes from.   
If you google the name of each school and reviews, you'll find some information. The most comprehensive reviews I have found are behind a subscription paywall on the Good Schools Guide international website. It also has a lot of articles on what to consider when choosing an international school. There are also educational consultants who can help you understand the differences between different schools and which might be a good fit for your children.   
Good luck.

If you're still here in 5 or 6 years time, your daughter will then be in 2nd or 3rd grade at school by which time the kids have an excellent grounding in high German.  At that age, all lessons are in high German with maybe just sports sessions and other less formal lessons held in dialect.   
Even then, if you relocate to the UK with no upkeep of the language, she is bound to lose a good % of it.  Some of it will stick, and her passive knowledge will remain to a certain extent but her active use of it will diminish over time.

			Hi There   
Good morning.    
We are looking for a Praktikum (for a week) for my 16 year old daughter who is doing her FMS. After trying for about 5 months without any success we turn to the EF for some advice and help. She is in the first year of her FMS (Fach Mittel Schule) and she has to do two Praktikums in the Proflie Marketing/Communication or PR. But until now we have not been able to find anything for her. To be honest we are so desperate that she is ready to do in any department she gets like a kindergarten, school, a hospital etc.    
I wanted to ask you if some of you have gone through this Project or if some of you have a small company where in she could do a Praktikum we would be very greatful.      
Thank you for reading    
We look forward to hear from you.    
Best Regards

			Hello!    
Yes, I do have experience of trying to integrate a non French speaking special needs child in the public school,system - but the answer is tricky as it largely varies from canton to canton.  But put in a nutshell, integrated schooling is much less common here and classroom aides are patchy and their experience and training can often have no relevance to your child's needs.     
You need to speak to this organisation   . They are Geneva based so will be best placed  to know the way forward for you and your sons.  There are some reputed private schools who do work with ASD children in the area so this would be certainly worth a look.   
On a related point - does your son receive any therapies currently?  You need to check the situation carefully regarding paying for these therapies as you may well find that they fall outside the remit of health insurance but that you cannot get federal disability funding for it either.   
Good luck!

			Hello,     
My 2.5 year old is really starting to utilize English and I am looking into starting a playgroup with other interested parents/children in the area.  The thing is... there is not much available in this part of Switzerland and so I am willing to travel a bit to make it happen. As an educator myself, I am willing to take the lead in terms of organization and planning.  If anyone (native or non) would like to have their little ones talking with other little ones in an organized way please pm me.     
Thanks.

			Anita are you looking for a course to lead to a degree, certification, etc.? Or are you 'just' looking for something fun and stimulating for personal enrichment?   
If the former, you might also want to look into Open University. But of course distance learning is a solitary pursuit, so if the social aspect is important to you there is that to consider. If you want to pursue a post graduate degree,  many at Swiss universities are conducted in English. If you want to go down that road there are many threads on the subject.   
If you are looking more for activities that provide personal enrichment,  you might want to consider clubs as well as courses. Art/music/culture groups, cooking groups, book clubs, etc. can provide intellectual stimulation in an informal setting. Look through the EF social calendar - you migh find something of interest to get you started. Or organize a group yourself. Additionally, one established english-language club in Zürich offering activities that might interest you is ZIWA, the Zürich International Woman's Association,   There are other similar expat groups as well.   
Hope you find what you are looking for...

			Zurich city: If your child will have to attend Kindergarten starting August 2014 because it is within the proper age range, you'll automatically receive a letter from the ""Kreisschulpflege"". That will be around February. In this letter, they will tell you more about the process. If you decide to send your child to a registered private Kindergarten, you'll have to write down the name/adress on a return letter. If you decide to send it you the public Kindergarten, return the letter with the proper information. Then, it's time to wait til June. By then, they'll send you the letter with name/address/Kindergarten teacher your child is assigned to. If you don't agree with the assignment you can send a protest note (=Wiedererwägungsgesuch), but be warned: You really need to have very good reasons for that...   
Here, you can find all public Kindergarten of Zurich:   Have a look on the left side (Schulkreise) and find out to which one you belong and where the Kindergartens are located.   
Language: Public Kindergarten-Language is swiss-german (=local language) and some part is in High German. Kids with problems in speaking/understanding the german language will attend 1 or 2 hrs of ""Deutsch als Zweitsprache"" (DaZ). No extra fee for that ;-). This will continue in Primary School if needed. English is taught starting primary class 2, french class 4.    
Public/private: hm... as a local, I would advise to send your child to the public Kindergarten. It will find friends within walking distance and this will make life much easier for you, too! And you'll get in touch with the local families and hopefully you will make friends with them :-)

			Some employers have discounted rates at specific childcare stations (creshs), so ask your future employer. 
You also get a small discount for the 2nd and 3rd kid.   
You could also look into getting an au pair (400-1200 chf/month), as your kids will only have just started speaking, and now you're bringing them into a new language.  The au pair could speak english.   
The school system here isn't geared for 2 full time working parents.

They also serve lunch every day, which is normally not included in the KG.  Also, since the other kids are ETH kids, many of them speak English as well as German, which might help your daughter feel more at home.

Typically as of second yr of KG.   
Is anyone using them and what are your thoughts on quality?   
I am thinking about it for next year for my daughter in Italian but it is a BIG hassle time wise etc so amd wondering whether it is worth it.

			Hi all,    
For all looking for a Kinderkrippe near Zug, I can only recommend the Kinderkrippe Pegasus in Hünenberg!! It is owned and held by a Polish lady with children and grand-children of her own. She is absolutely fantastic and I can't say enough good things about her! Her daycare is fabulous with a ton of things for the children to do, they also have direct access to the garden and go on daily walks to a nearby playground. Every child is cared for and receives individual attention. Having my daughter in her daycare has been fabulous and we always felt like a big family. Anything I would focus on at home would be picked up right where I left it when my daughter entered daycare in the morning!   
Highly recommended and I wish my daughter was still there!! Missing this place tremendously!!    
Let me know if you have any questions!!        
Laura

			Hello!   
We have a 5 year old High functioning ASD although he is in a special treatment/therapy centre and not in school.     
It is all very cantonal based as to what is available. You should get in touch with   who are based in Geneva and will have all the information to enable you to make an informed decision.  If you are not relying on private schooling/treatment, the provision of in class support is very patchy and very varied.  Even where it is offered, it is unusual for the aide to be specifically trained in ASD conditions/techniques etc which is what drove our particular decision to not even try main stream schooling as if we wanted specialist care, we had to go to a specialist centre.  Of course, this is in Jura which is a small (population size) out of the way canton.  Things have to be better Geneva way.  But do ask as to what specialist training the in class aides have - friends of ours have been assigned a lovely aide who previous to this year had been teaching french as a second language support classes for years.  she was asked to take on one to one support of this high functioning 8 year old with no special training or preparation.  Whilst I understand the parents are desperate to keep him in mainstream, the news that his behaviour is going downhill this year is sadly not a surprise. So check this, thoroughly.   
However, to sound a big warning note - any treatment beyond education is considered as healthcare (so many of the routine therapies your child might be receiving) and if your child was not born in CH, you will not receive state disability funding to pay for these treatments and probably your health insurance will object to funding it.  Each Canton has different rules as to what therapies are included in special education so check that out - here in Jura, speech therapy is included but psychomotor therapy is not - just as an example.  Not only does your child need to have been born here but you need to have been paying contributions for 12 months prior to his birth.  The rules are slightly different for Swiss nationals but as we are not Swiss, I cannot help you there.    
Also very useful is   ""autisme suisse romande"".  Only of use if you speak French - which from the fact that you are currently in Moselle, I suspect you do!

			Just re-read the OP. Five months is a long time- did you not enrol him in an intensive German course on arrival- and continued with intensive tuition during the Summer to help him? By now, he should be getting to good communicative level, with a good basic grasp of Grammar. Did you try to enrol him at the local school where you live- or tried to get him in a school out of the official 'catchment' area (which is almost impossible to do here).   
Starting a new school in a new country, without any of the language, at 15 is extremely difficult. Much easier in the UK where there is more choice of subjects, and where one can continue to study post 16 in a very limited number of subjects (4, then only 3 for final year). Students here do 3 years instead of 2 in UK for senior/pre uni level, and most students finish compulsory schooling at 15. The Gemeinde is not likely to agree to take him on in the middle of the year. This is really tough- and of course we do not know about your circumstances- but I really feel for your poor son. Streaming in Switzerland between academic and vocational studies is done early, and to access the academic streams a student has to have excellent command of German, French or Italian, in order to be able to deal with the demands of the course, and also good knowledge of a second national language. We can argue about the pros and cons of this until the cows come home- but for now it is a fact that any parent of children over the age of 9 should understand before coming here.

			Hi Jim2007,   
Thanks a lot for your reply!   
Initially I was convinced it was a big plus. But now, after having researched a bit the internet, I start to doubt of the actual usefulness of passing the first level while being a student. On top of that, as you said, I agree that getting lower grands in the masters due to the study hours spent on the CFA would be a shame...   
Thanks !

			Did you ever find some help? I have a high functioning 7 year-old and live just over the border in France. Trying to get help for him is a constant and exhausting struggle. I am re-starting the process of trying to find someone to deliver ABA therapy to him as his latest therapists are unable to continue.   
I can share some contacts I've made over the last couple of years which may be helpful. Drop me an e-mail @ [mod edit-email removed] if  
you want to talk more.   
All the best, 
Sarah

I want to apply to ETH applied mathematics MS program. Do I really have chances with  7 years academic gap (I'm 28 at the mom) or such a gap is somewhat totally unacceptable for admission committee?

			Are there any Americans here in Switzerland whose kids are US citizens and like math and are fairly advanced in math (Gymnasium level), who would like to take the Mathematical Association of America's AMC (American Mathematics Competition) contests, or are already planning to do so?     
On a similar note, there is a somewhat similar contest called the North  American Computational Linguistics Olympiad, which is quite fun to do if  you like puzzles. This is open to North Americans from 6th grade on up.     
If either of these are things you are already or would like to be involved in, would you PM me? I'm trying to figure out who's already doing this, if anyone, or if not, whether there's any interest in making it happen.   
Thanks!

			We are in the same situation as the OP, but for 1st grade. I can tell you how it went two years ago, when our daughter started Kindergarten.   
In the winter (December?) we got a letter telling us she's due to start next August. There was a question of whether the child attends daycare and whether we would want the Kindergarten to be close to home or close to daycare. In our case, it was the same, but we picked ""Close to daycare"". Now she attends Kindergarten within walking distance of her (private) daycare.   
We moved recently and wanted to investigate afternoon care options close to our new place. I went and spoke to the office personally; while there was no place at the local Tagesschule for a kindergarten-aged child, they helped me look at options and told me they'll keep me posted if anything changes and told me there would in all likelihood be a place next year, when she starts 1st grade. It was completely fine for her to keep attending her old kindergarten, now quite far from where we live, so she can continue in her old daycare.   
I'm expecting the new piece of paper any day now, the 1st grade application form. They seem to take parents' wishes into account and are approachable and can be talked to, even if your German is not fluent. Good luck!

Tjena,   
there's no overwhelming favorite university within the german speaking part of the country. Yet the University of zurich is the only one requiring latin knowledge (in terms of certain subjects at the philosophical faculty). consider that! it might be both an obstacle but also a benefit...   
I'm swiss and doing my master degree at Zürich (history and linguistics). however this semester I study at Stockholm University   (erasmus). I think that the academical level is noticeably higher at Zürich. Stockholm focuses practical aspects wheras Zürich stresses rather theory. but i can't compare Zürich with Bern or basel..

			You may want to check the cost of bi-lingual or full english kindergartens before taking a decision. the public kindergarten (full in german) are free of cost. You may also wanted to check the level of education offered here compared to that in your home country (I presume India) if you will move back after 2 years. The learning system is very slow in the initial years, picking up speed only after primary school which is not the case in India.

			I am offering private math training to 6-graders planning to take the Zentrale Aufnahmeprüfung (ZAP) exam for Langgymnasium. 
Zurich/Winterthur area, reasonable rates.   
It's fairly common knowledge that generally primary school 6-graders do not have enough mathematical skills to pass the ZAP without additional and specific training for the test. Schools usually organize ZAP preparation courses but they are limited, not individualized and most likely will not be sufficient. Here is what I offer:   
- Review and strengthening of the skills attained in primary school (fast in-head and written calculation, unit conversions, geometry skills, etc.) and tailoring an individual training plan based on the initial skill level of the student.   
- Introduction to basic real math concepts and tools, such as variables and equations, operations on fractions, etc., and training the ability to use them. This is complimentary to the primary school curriculum which typically does not go beyond simplistic proportions. Students who sit the ZAP are expected either to be able to figure out how to use their rather limited proportion-based skills to solve complicated exam problems or to have real math skills and use them (which can be a lot easier and less error-prone). These real math skills will also be helpful during the Probezeit at the gymi, increasing the chance of successfully completing the probation semester.   
- Familiarizing with the exam format and the typical types of ZAP math problems. Strategy and methods for solving those types of problems.   
- Drilling problems from the past actual ZAP exams and from training exams, working on bringing the speed up to the necessary level (time is very limited at the actual exam.)   
In February it is advisable to go and sit a simulation exam ( ) which will provide a snapshot of the student's ability and will give the child an experience very close to taking the actual exam.   
Please send me a PM if interested

			As far as I know it's a complete no no to go out of school in another area.    
The system is not at all flexible as other posters have indicated. The philosophy here is that all schools are good, kids walk to the local one and they are part of the local community. It's all very well in theory but sometimes, and for a variety of reasons, it doesn't work out like this.    
Sometimes it's not even possible to pay the 10 K fee to go out of gemeinde, (and if you are desperate to switch 10 K is still far cheaper than a private school)

			Speak to the international schools and see if they offer the same subjects, if they do it should be ok.    
If not he could stay in UK for a year to finish them, them move over at the beginning of 6th form. Or move over now and maybe drop back a year and do two years of the GCSEs offered at the school.    
But I had kids in my year at school who moved mid-gcse's ... It does happen!

Another thought is if you'd like to see a language cafe meet-up in Bern, start one yourself and invite others. The meet-ups you see on the EF events calendar are usually hosted by EF people, not by the cafes. Just pick a date and time, post the information including location in the events section of the Forum, and hopefully you'll make some new friends.

Don't worry about the language barrier when it comes to playdates. It certainly won't bother your daughter, and you can go a long way with a few hand gestures etc.

			As a minimum you need the CELTA certificate to teach English as a foreign language. You need to be a native English speaker or have a level of English that is equivalent to that if you are not a native speaker. If you are not a native speaker they will test you. Although you understand the English written here and can reply accordingly there are a lot of mistakes with your English and currently you would not pass the test as a result. Take some time to improve it and then consider it again. Good luck.

			Accomodation on campus: Switzerland is a very little country and so are our campuses - no comparison with american locations (accomodation, events, campus life etc..!    
Lausanne university, as most universities in Switzerland, has a lack of student-accomodation in and around the campus. 
To get an idea of regular accomodation cost, here is a popular search site for lodgings in Switzerland:

			An Apostille? That doesn't sound right..   
An Apostille does not confirm that a document is an original.. Basically what an Apostille does in an international context is that in case you have a notarized copy, it confirms that the notary public who notarized it is empowered to do so. A notarized copy of a diploma means that the notary public confirms that the copy is a true copy of the original. Whether or not the original is a valid document is not examined by the notary public and therefore an Apostille doesn't say anything about it either.   
However, should you have a notarized copy of your diploma, you can get an Apostille at the Staatskanzlei, a list can be found on:      
Just FYI: You don't need to show up there in person, you can send any friend of yours / a lawyer etc. Same is true for the notarized copy. (I know bc I've done it countless times for clients)

			If you're resident here it's different though.  Have a look at the special cases link as it gives a list (in German/French only) of foreigners who are considered the same as Swiss nationals when applying.  It's people outside of Switzerland wanting to come in and study medicine that have more problems getting accepted.

There are no fees.  However, lunch is not included, and kindergarten (first year) is mornings only.  Drop-off is starting at 8:10 and kids are done at 12:00.  Your child would need to be four and a half (birthdays are in the source) to start school.

			Hi   
My daughter goes to Sonnenrain, she started this summer, and she is happy enough... The teacher seems somehow strict, though.  
I do not have any complaints so far, maybe it's a little too early... Moreover, my daughter hardly speaks anything about the school activities, so I do not know much from her.. However, they keep on sending letters informing parents of different activities.. I guess similar to other kindergartens.. 
One good thing perhaps is that they have a Hort and lunch table right there.   
You can ask me if you have any specific question regarding the kindergarten..

			Our children were in bilingual Montessori school, but not for the English, for the Montessori. Our eldest has now made the transition to local secondary school and our second child is due to make the transition at the end of this year, and is on target to do so...he might even scrape in to Gymnasium if he puts his head down.    
Bilingual was a 'soft' option for our children when they arrived, but it was only the eldest who really suffered the change, and she's always been 'interesting' and has had support from the school psychologist and other systems for the transition when it occurred....   
If we were not Montessori orientated, then I'd never suggest International schools for kids under age 9. Our daughter was 9 when we arrived and she really found it hard, but our son was 6.5 and he took to German and French like a duck to water, and we have been told that both his High German and his Swiss German are 'perfect' (he can do both, and a pretty convincing Bern-Deutch/Zuri-Deutch switch as well)...   
As others have pointed out, the more gentle approach to the early academics makes sense when it allows the kids to really catch up on the language skills that they need - I get the feeling that the early curriculum does set back a bit from perhaps the (monolingual) UK system, but in the longer-term, they catch up fast in upper primary, and the focus is on providing multiple pathways where 'academics' is not everything - the kids who can perform to a very narrow academic expectation (which I would argue is the current emphasis in the UK/US political/educational system)... are streamed out in the Swiss system to the 'Gymnasium' and the schools offer lots of alternative streams, apprenticeships and other tertiary studies, with the ultimate goal that all children are a) socally integrated, b) teachable and c) employable.   
My daughter is in the second year of the secondary school, she's in the highest academic stream in the local school (one below the Gymnasium), and she is welcome to do additional classes of 'gymi prep' to go over the exam requirements for the Gymnasium, even though she's not likely to succeed if she sits the exam, as the requirements are so limited (100% in German and Maths)...and she doesn't perform well in exam conditions (perfectionist, works too slow).... however, in (equivalent grade 8) they begin doing pre-vocational training, and will do a multi-level assessment/aptitude/personal reflection and lots of vocational studies this year and next, to try to determine a pathway for each child. By end of grade 9 some kids will go across to the Gymnasium stream, some will start apprenticeships, some will do a 10th year (we keep encouraging her to think about doing her 10th year in French), and from there, pre-university studies, other forms of apprenticeships, work....    
I think you have to delve much deeper into how the Swiss system works and what doors will be opened if your children are integrated into the German/French/English structure of the local system. In Zurich, English is also prioritised. I have apprentices who I supervise at work, and some are doing combined apprenticeship/pre-university courses, some have completed a straight apprenticeship and then moved on to do the transition to university, some are going from apprenticeships into full-time jobs and careers. Eventually, they seem to need to sit entrance exams at the higher levels in German, French and English.    
I also have work-experience students who have come out of the international school, and they are very limited locally - can't access university, need to study another year after doing their secondary school to be able to sit local exams, have to consider going to an english-speaking country to study... I know from experience that moving away for University is a much bigger stress than being able to stay home and study..financially and psychologically...

A bit of background info.    
I spent two years living in Norway and my daughter went to a Norwegian barnehagen, which very much believed in the system that the OP is espousing. It is, generally, the Nordic way of doing things, of allowing children freedom to explore and ""be themselves"" free from artificial constraints. It is also part of the Nordic system of equality, that no one is better than another. These are, on the whole, quite laudable aims but they do come at a price and it is a price that very many of my Nordic students quite openly questioned - particularly when they first met other systems of schooling.   
The OP, quite naturally, wishes the very best for her children. I just feel that it is not something that is going to happen in this part of Europe. I suspect that the best avenue for the OP would be to locate a Montessori or Steiner schooling system.

			We're a bit further along the lake from you.. However same will apply.  
We found that there are loads of nursery type places around, every little village has one or two. But many don't have websites so it's not easy to find them or know which language they speak etc. 
Word of mouth is always good and so is some leg work. I took a day off work, took my little girl and went around the nearby villages and visited a bunch or places, how they feel is imoprtant.     
We picked one based on - It was small, only 10 kids and 2 ""teachers"". It was close, five minute drive. Daughter loved it. They had space. They will only speak french to the kids, unless somebody gets hurt or something like that. Unfortunately (from the language point of view) half of the new kids who joined are also english speaking!  But it's a good mix and she's picking it up.

			They learn to learn, rather than being taught by rote. They also learn social skills and such.  
I guess, as my daughter is a summer child, I'm happy with her not being forced into a desk and chair to learn her times tables and how to pass exams at just 5. But I do also teach her to read and write myself (actually atoz phonics started it, and I've carried on) but only because she is interested. I think if you force a child to learn something when they are not receptive then they rebel against it.  
A lot of kids here don't go to nursery before school, like in the UK and Ireland too, so the social skills thing is good for them.

			I have not considered local school at this point. It is true both english and swiss deutsch are foreign to our kids but we hope them to learn primarily english for several reasons (f.e. our potential stay in Switzerland may be limited to 2-3 yrs and if relocating again international schools are using english).   
However the Swiss local school seems very appealing based on your mails, very much like in our native country. If international school gives only bad vibes I may need to re-think the situation. Ultimately it is most important that our son gets the needed support, regardless of language...

			You only get results for MKZ because it is so large and its services very diverse. I would recommend that you take a look at their services before going to other schools just to give you an idea of their offer. They teach jazz piano also and all the teachers are very well selected so there are no surprises on this part. The teachers teach all over Zurich in various school locations, they will try to find one that accommodates you.   
Good luck!

			The difficulty lies with it not being stipulated in the signed contract. A verbal agreement (or via email) followed by a written contract becomes more or less irrelevant and only what was finalised in writing will be enforceable. In other words, if the subsidised child care was essential part of the negotiation, it should have been reflected in the final written contract.   
I would suggest you try the argument that the employer was aware of the essential need for childcare, without which your wife may not have been able to take the job. The additional hardship this change in employement conditions brings should be compensated possible through some salary raise or an agreement to pay part of the child care costs elsewhere.    
It's risky... but you never know. At the very least you may be able to agree something amongst all the other parents (who I assume will also be present) and see if some arrangement can be found to suit all parties.

			Hi Amy, any luck yet? Have you been able to visit the school? This is probably the best way to exchange with other parents. If you're not able to visit, you might try contacting the school and asking for them to put you in touch with some parents. While these will likely be parents who have a good rapport with the school, they will likely be willing to refer you to other parents with varied/nuanced opinions. 
Also, while there aren't many posts on the subject so far, some previous users have discussed ICS on other threads. You might try searching the forum and directly contacting individual users who've posted about ICS. Good luck!

			Hi there,    
I stumbled across this forum and have read a number of posts concerning PhD program at ETH - thanks to all for the great info so far.  I'm interested in applying to two labs at ETH, in Biomechanics (Ferguson's lab) or in the SMS lab (R. Riener).  I have a MSc with a 3.7 GPA, some publications and abstracts, tonnes of teaching experience, and clinical work as a neurophysiologist.    
As I'm coming from Canada, making a decision to study here is one I do not take lightly. After some investigation, I feel ETH could be a great start to my research career. I also have some ideas about what I'd like to do, and a direction in which I'd like to focus my subsequent career. I'm currently working on an application and familiarizing myself with each lab's projects, before making the initial contact. I haven't yet solidified a specific plan for each department, however. I'm fully aware of the workload involved in a PhD, and am not put off by it.      
In any event, some questions:    
1. My biggest concern is supervisor-student relationships, and fit within the group(s).  Is anyone familiar with Ferguson's or Riener's labs? If so, could you give me the low down on the environment, personalities etc?  If not with these labs, with these programs in general? Anyone to strongly avoid?    
2. If you are familiar with these labs, do you have any suggestions on how I should approach Dr. Ferguson/Dr. Riener?    
3. I know ETH pays their students well, and although it is not my main concern, it is still somewhat of a concern. I know that the % salary is largely dependent on the lab/supervisor. Is anyone familiar with approximate salaries for these two labs?  In previous graduate work, I've been given a contract with a specific salary, and ended up not receiving anything for months. I definitely don't want to have this experience again.    
4. I come from an exercise science background, with graduate courses and RA experience in a biomechanics lab. Could anyone tell me how math/computer science/engineering-based these programs are? What kind of preparation should I undertake to ensure I could keep up? I am going through some Matlab, calculus and linear algebra study right now.    
5. If I want to begin work in roughly a year, when should I approach the supervisors with whom I am interested in working?    
6. Do all departments require an interview?    
I think this is it for now. Many thanks for your help.

There is the issue of (a) gaining admission (b) placing out of entry-level requirements and (c) receiving college credit for a high score. Some U.S. universities allow students not only to place out of entry-level courses for which they've gotten high scores in an analogous AP/IB/GCE subject but even afford college credit for these grades. Although it might be more work to (a) be admitted to a U.S. university from a Matura background, this should be possible. For some universities, it will also be possible to (b) place out of entry-level requirements. If the university offers this for the subject in question, even if the Matura grade isn't sufficient to prove proficiency, a placement exam might be offered to prove proficiency. (c) Receiving credit for high Matura grades is less likely, even for universities that offer AP/IB/GCE credit. In some cases, a placement exam proving proficiency might allow students to receive credit for Matura courses.

Yes, there are alternatives to academic jobs if you do a PhD.  ""Normal jobs"", for one thing, although you may find them boring.  Companies are being spun out of ETH (and academica generally) all the time, so you might wind up in one of those, or even founding one of those.  For me, that would be the best outcome, but that's me.

			Hi everyone,   
I need help, I am planning to pursue PhD in Switzerland. I am confuse!!!   
1) Which University would be the best University for Business Administration (Marketing, Finance, HR and Strategy). I prefer Finance, since I am an MBA in Finance.   
2) Which University accept MBA graduate for PhD in Business Administration program (Finance, Marketing, HR, Strategy, Accounting, Operation etc). As I read from the websites of many universities of switzerland, I find many universities prefer to take Msc (Finance and Business Studies) for PhD in Finance and even for other programs as well. But in my country all this subjects are mostly studied by MBA and B.Com students not by Msc students. For the fact, University of Zurich do not accept MBA finance for Phd finance according to their response to my inquiry.   
Thanking you in advance.

Medical school in the US does not start until after you complete your bachelor, and you don't need any specific ""major"" as long as you take the science courses required by medical schools. However, the admissions process for med school in the US seems even tougher than in Switzerland in terms of the percentages that actually get in. Not sure of your nationality, but most med school slots in the US are reserved for Americans, which is similar to Switzerland only admitting Swiss nationals and residents to their medical programs.

			was he happy in his former class? did he play with the others and participate during class? part of school is learning academics, but another big part is learning social skills, play, etc- which is even more important for a child coming from another culture/lang background.    
when my son came, academically he was higher than other students at his level, but he didn't have any french and he wasn't accustomed to the school system here- which was different from what he knew before. so we decided to keep him back to get comfortable and worrying about academics later when everything else is in place.    
as a teacher i've had students who were very advanced but lacked the comfort and confidence that is needed in the classroom- this is very important and is a skill that is needed just as much as math, reading, etc.   
does he enjoy school? is he used to playing with other children?    
another thing is the relationship between him and the teacher. it's really important in the beginning of school. if he felt more at ease with the first teacher- that is a big plus. if he still likes this new class, despite the issues, then it is easier to work with her if she is willing.    
if you can visit, that's a good step. maybe also discussing her rules with him and seeing how you can help him to keep afloat in this class- if that is what you want. maybe socially he is looking for a class that has more freedom- more playtime and social time, which would be the class he came from.

			Apprenticeship placements in childcare are very hard to find, and often they ask for a practicum year first, to see if you are suited to the apprenticeship. You do work during an apprenticeship but pay is very poor, don't expect to be able to live off the income. You could go to your local BIZ (Berufsinformationszentrum) for more info, they would also have a list of local childcare centres that offer apprenticeships.

it is cost 50, then suggest something like 30 or 35, but go ahead and ask 40 or 45, but dont think many would be bothered with 5 or 10 discount   
good luck

			Just a heads up, we found out that in Gymnasium they don't provide any of the supplies, and we had to pay for the books too.  That's 200-300 chf worth of books and supplies.  Beginning of year sticker shock!     
Plus my daughter dutifully started her homework right away, including writing (in pencil! lightly!) in a 50CHF English grammar workbook, which she might be able to get out of....  I'll post separately a question about that.

			I believe most Masters programmes at ETHZ are in English, but you have to check. If English is not your mother tongue, you'll have to prove proficiency (e.g. TOEFL).   
Nobody can answer the question about your chances definitively unless they sit on the admissions committee.

			Just wanted to add a few things, as I do some teaching and grading at the ETHZ in Biology:   
The lectures from year three forward through the masters program are almost always in English (to practice the language, but also because many of the professors are not fluent in German!).  However, many of the hands-on lab courses (Praktika) are taught exclusively in German until they become ""block courses,"" which are in actual labs rather than in lab classrooms.  At this point, the language is decided by whoever is teaching within the lab (usually English or German).   
From what I saw, this Biotechnology course is the third year only, and must be done after a two year program in a related subject.  The first two years would be in German at the ETHZ, but you can also do a program in Lausanne, which would presumably be in French.

			I was in a Swiss school for about a year and a half when I was 11. All the lessons were in High German. During lessons there would be general discussion between teacher and pupils about the topic. These were all conducted in Swiss German. When the lesson recommenced it was back to High German. At the end of the school day when discussing home work it was in Swiss German. I never was confused at all it is something you get used to especially at a young age.   
I think it important to be able to speak Swiss german as when outdside school with peers they will speak Swiss German. Also in the work place he will need to speak Swiss German.

			First day of kindergarten for my little one. 
She learned keeping quiet and raising your hand..... Both things she admits she needs to have more lessons in. Last night we practiced raising hands to talk.... A bit strange when it's just the two of us, and I had to be the kindergarterin, so it was just her, she pretended to be all the kids in her kindsgi, except she only knew one name.

I've taken a few courses on Coursera, and some have been good, but the intro to Python course is not among them - at least if it's still taught by the same profs, Scott Rixner and Joe Warren. They did not teach it very clearly and I ended up getting frustrated and quitting about 4 weeks in.

			In retrospect one of my children could have integrated into the Swiss system but it's too late now. 
I have to say that I've found the level of teaching good at the school, some teachers are excellent, others have not been such a great match for my kids, but all are qualified and do a good job. As in all schools there isn't always enough time for everything but my (older) kids get a fair bit of homework to compensate.   
I should add, in fairness, the highest tuition rates are for the senior school, junior school is much more reasonable c.23,000 (IIRC)  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	International School Basel?	"""Carbs"	Posts: 14	3,900	12	Education

			Being fascinated at this ""throw back"" to a gentler (or is that more uptight?) time, I googled it and found this BBC article on the above mentioned school. . It appears that its goal is really to form its students into gracious hostesses and hammer ""international"" etiquette into them. That cannot be a bad thing. My own lot could use better manners. I expect the basics of good etiquette, though, could be delivered in a three day workshop. My philosophical question is this: Is it worth spending 20,000 and six months on learning the finer details of proper etiquette in a world (and judging by media, this includes the ""cream"" of society) that has by large forgotten what it is? Kind of like making the effort to learn a lost language and expecting to speak it on the street.

			Sekundarstufe I is usually grades 7 to 9, Sekundarstufe II is grades 9 to 12. But when there are shortages a teacher sometimes works in a different age group than they are qualified for. There is also often some overlap, i.e.  a Sek II teacher teaching grade 7 or 8.

			You can find a Job that offers to pay a teacher training program or Lehre if they offer it in German. 
Most of the time this programs are in German but some schools offer them in English too but online. 
Also this is for Preschool teaching, I guess for teaching in Kindergarten and older kids, you must have a teaching degree.

You are   what it takes for your kids to proceed as if they had stayed in that school, and you   whether there is possibility to prepare the exam, you   whether a different exam date is possible, you   whether there is the possibility of probation to confirm the grades, you   how to allow your children to come back to the wonderful and superior Swiss education despite the very unlucky family situation in the past six months.    
You don't have to believe it, you just have to say it.    
I can't promise you'll get what you want, but at least, they will really try to work within the system to the best of the children's academic career. When the system doesn't allow something, though, even a school director can't bend the rules. I really don't know Geneva cantonal exams, sorry for that. No idea what they mean. A teacher closer to the jet d'eau should be able to say more about it.

A colleague of mine tells me that the only reason this was dropped because there is a lot of competition for students and the colleges need fees.   
If you are seeking a career on the accounting side then you should think about a professional accounting qualification as it will hold a lot more weight than a masters.  And if you look at the failure rates of the major professional bodies you'll see why.   
If you are looking at wealth management or investments, then a better path is to try and get on a graduate programme with one of the financial institutions and do CFA, it is well thought of qualification in that area and like the accounting qualifications it is a very demanding qualification.   
I would also suggest that professional accounting to investments is not a very common career progression.  In fact the only two that spring to mind are David Drumm and Sean FitzPatrick at   and that did not go too well   "	considered unworthy	Join Date: May 2008	Groaned at 26 Times in 9 Posts	Master degree in Finance.

			Our daughter was 4 when we moved to Austria and was fluent in German at kindergarten within 6 months. I also met people who had kids of various ages (4 - 13) who had been put straight into German speaking schools with no supplementary support and they all managed eventually. Friends of ours moved to Luzern with their 6 year old son and he went straight into a Swiss local School anf had 3 hours extra German tuition per week.  He is doing really well 3 years on.   
I'm sure your 6 year old will learn and integrate very quickly. The older two may find it more difficult and take longer but if they are motivated I'm sure they will cope.   
Living in a multicultural area will help so oyu are not the only non-natives around. On my daughter's first day a school it turned out that 2 girls in her class were also native English speakers and 6 months later she realised another girl also spoke English. At our local school the native English kids have their own English class so they don't have to do the normal English curriculum.   
Good luck with your move.

 It's natural, people look at a job which doesn't have an obvious technical barrier to entry and they think ""yeah, I could do that."" (And honestly? They probably can. The question is how steep will their learning curve be and what about the hapless students/clients/employees who have to deal with them in the meantime.)

			If it's just to improve her German why not look at a local Swiss nursery?  It's not as expensive as the Montessori option.     
Kids starting at Kindergarten with little or no German soon pick it up anyway.  If they are still struggling after the first year they are given German as a second language sessions.  They seem to be pretty geared up to it here so I wouldn't worry too much.

			Fascinating concept. Could you give more details regarding the Basel based school. Where will it be? Is it a privately owned school, or a verein?  Are qualified teachers employed as Facilitators, or is it a form of homeschooling, with parental supervision? Or? Is it expected to open with young learners, or is it aimed at older students?

			Hello,   
I am interested in a tutor too.   
I am looking for an English tutor (mother tongue) for my two girls (3 1/2 and 5 1/2) for 2 times a week, 2 hs each time (one h with each girl).   
The lesson will be to play with the small kid and improve vocabulary and little phrases and answer to questions, and small reading and writing with the bigger kid.   
I leave in the ETH Universitat area. Students are more than welcome.   
I would need this ""support"" from end of August untill the end of the year at least.   
I am looking for the same support on hoch German. Same solution (twice a week for 2 hs, each h with a single kid) from a German mother tongue (not interested in swiss german). This will happen in different days than English lessons.   
Again, students more than welcome here too.   
If you a interested please drop me a message.   
Many thanks in advance for any help.   
Delia

			Hello everyone! 
As you can see I am new to this particular forum, I am approximately 20 years old and have picked up a huge interest in ETH Zurich and in particular one program, namely master in Management, Technology, and Economics.    
The problem however is that I can't find to much information about placement after graduation, what the initial salary is and more important which employers who recruit from this program, are McKinsey, BCG and other management consulting firms recruiting from the program?      
Furthermore I would like to know the portion of international students at this program, and the opportunities upon graduation.    
Kind Regards Victor from Sweden

			Have you done any searching about education, schooling etc. in Switzerland?  Either on this site or google?  At that age, I am pretty sure it would not be recommended for your daughter to attend a local school.  You will most likely want to contact an international school directly.  Or maybe stay in India for her to finish her studies.  At that stage you need to be fluent in the local language (German) and I don't know if it would be in your daughter's best interest to go that route.

			@JohnR, 
Yes, they just invited me  . I asked them how many % I should work next to the program and they told me minimum 50%. Since the classes will take place only twice a week in the late afternoon I think there should not be a problem to work 70%.   
@Longbyt, 
The reason to do a program in English in Switzerland is because everything is getting more and more international. BTW this program exists in Switzerland already in German, French and Italian for many years.

Our first went through 2 years of Montesorri and then switched to local KG when we moved out of Basel.   
Not really looked back since.   
All that you mentioned above, and more, is covered by our local KG (we don't have a choice).   
There have been some issues that we've not been so keen on, but rough with the smooth - overall the Montesorri was no better and cost (a lot) more.    
Personally, I think if parents are wanting to make a choice, they should go speak to the teacher... to me that's the biggest factor of whether a class is good or not. There are shit Montesorri teachers, just as there are great ""public"" KG teachers and vice versa.   
I think the OP is basically describing the Swiss education system, from the experience of 1 place withough knowing the details of the public sector other than what she(?) learnt from/through some interviews.   
Besides, shouldn't this be under commercial?

			Fund-raising is a well-established part of swiss school childrens lives; by the time they're in their teens they're quite used to doing/selling things to raise money for; school trips, days out, charity, etc.   
The idea is to make them more aware of the concept that you don't get anything for nothing, so the parent buying up all the tickets or whatever rather defeats the object of the 'lesson'. Which might be why it's been refered to as homework. A translation error?   
Not that I haven't fallen into that trap myself in the past...... just saying.

			It's an actual class. After a while the kids can move into the mainstream classes.   
Italy is very widely spoken in Basel. My Italian speaking friend has more luck than I do when I try to speak French (if we run out of German and the person has no English).     
We first came to Pratteln which also has a high number of non-swiss. The problem we found in the schools was that there simply weren't enough natives for our kids to pick up the language properly! None of our kids went into intergration classes, as mostly that was for kids who not only didn't speak German, but also had had very little schooling. The authorities felt our children would be better served by going directly into mainstream Swiss school. With our youngest starting Gymnasium and our oldest now in Basel University, it's worked out quite well.   
I agree with Faltrad - there are definitely other great career paths than Gym. Our middle child is exploring these.   
Gym is  .

			Don't know much about the EMBA program at St Gallen, but I do know a couple of people who finished their MBA at HSG. The class size is small, most participants didn't have a bachelor or master's degree in business, so you have medical doctors, engineers, and people who studied liberal arts in university. The reputation and brand recognition of St Gallen is pretty strong in the German speaking area... What is your background and what are your career aspirations after the EMBA? location/industry/job function...?

			[QUOTE=michaelem;1884936   
As for the recognition of degrees, be careful how you consider this aspect. Switzerland has a system of separating public-funded from private education. I understand that Business School Lausanne is a private school and as such its degrees are probably not recognized by the cantonal authorities in Switzerland, same with any other private school, e.g.  IMD. I bet they have a licence to operate as an educational institution and recognition in this sense rather stands for state-funded. Unless you want a Swiss government job, I would not bother too much for not being on that list.   
[/QUOTE]

			The first years are important as they learn to play with each other, I am sure your daughter will love it at kindergarten. You can talk to the teacher and ask if she can attend 2 days this term, and see if she really is ready for an August start.

I need to engage a tutor for Algebra 2 (US high-school curriculum) for the duration of June 2013. Basel city or Baselland preferred. If you can recommend someone, I'll be most grateful!

			Hiring a local nanny for a few hours few days per week could be a good option as an alternative or in addition to the playgroup. My daughter is 3.5 yo as well. I can compare 9 months in the playgroup with 1 month with nanny (the amount of time per week is about the same) and I could say that the latter gives better results in language learning. If the playgroup is very international it could be that half of more of the children do not speak local language as well as your daughter. The playgroup leader communicates with 10 or more children together and could not adapt to the speed of learning of your daughter, while a private nanny can explain things few times and ask questions.    
I made a conclusion for myself, that if you want your child to learn language fast you either have to send him/her to the daycare for the full day at least 3 days per week (very expensive and 1-2 years waiting time in our area) or to hire a good private nanny/teacher.

			Hello, 
does anybody in this forum currently studies, or has studied in the past, for the CAS in Computer Science at ETH Zurich (   
If yes...are you able to conciliate full or part-time work with it? Did you get a scholarship for it?   
And do you know of other similar CAS in other Swiss Universities? I couldn't find any other for Computer Science...   
Thanks a lot

If yes, your life will be easier as the convert IB-UK is well structured and crystal clear. There are however a few subtleties that only an international school can give you exact, correct and updated info about.  
Secondly, the choice of subject is essential for university applications.  
> Easy route: son knows where he wants to go, the subjects are chosen accordingly and plan B is thought through right from the start.  
> Hard route: son doesn't know and must keep options open. A couple of standard flexible mixes of subjects will be discussed with the school according to son's abilities. This restricts freedom of choice immensely, though.    
I don't have updated info as this is old stuff to me, but make sure you discuss it through very early in your moving plans with the school. Their interest is to have high passing rate for PR purposes (and out of professionalism too, I guess) so if they warn you about something, they have a good reason to do so.

			Where we are in Zurich they have something called a hort, which I understand to be after school care run by the state (not free of charge) for those whose parents work, i.e. somewhere the kids who don't go home for lunch can eat their packed lunch and be supervised in the afternoon. Sometimes it is purpose built right next door to or as an integral part of the kindergarten/school, sometimes not (often in the case of older communities/buildings).    
In our community, at lunch time all the kindergarten kids who don't go home are walked to the hort by an adult (they have to walk ca. 10. minutes across a moderately busy road).   
Here's the link to info in Zurich city     
maybe there is something similar in Bern? I assumed it was a swiss-wide concept, but may be wrong!

			I have first Hand experience of TAZ and can highly recommend the School. The one week english / one week german approach works very well, allowing for more choice later on when deciding whether to continue in the bilingual System or go into the swiss System. Most children seem to cope very well and like having 2 teachers!  
Yes there was a high turn around of staff at one stage but since the new Management has come this appears to have settled down. 
 The Advantage over the purely international Schools is that the children are more local and not just here for a year or so before leaving again. Very important for class stability! There is a real sense of Family in the School - amonst the children and amongst the staff.  
As in all Schools, there will of course be Problems at some Point, but my Impression is that the teachers and School Management are always open for discussion and to find Solutions - that are right for the children! 
But as said in a previous post: choice of School is a personal Thing and what works for some will not work for others. Go and have a look at the School, talk to the head and make your own decision.

			in my case i changed my job just after graduating. whether this can be directly attributed to the MAS MTEC cannot be answered 100%... in general, i'll put it like this: apart from extending your network, a program like this one has 2 effects: 1st you gain additional knowledge, and 2nd you send a signal to an employer that you are willing to develop yourself. both may help to get a new / better job, but it's definitely not ""guaranteed""... it depends on what you make out it. however, the program & school is definitely very good for people in it/science/engineering industries. and ETH has a good reputation.

			Sounds like you definitely need to contact schools then, as they seem to all have some sort of support but all different. For my kids, the integration class is only mornings and they will go to their regular school and be immersed in their respective classes in the afternoons. It also only lasts 10-20 weeks, not the whole year.

			If you look at some similar threads, the 11 year old will likely have quite a few issues, as at that age, it is the years of streaming in Vaud.  If coming from a private school, they normally have to take a test and are streamed accordingly.  If moving to CH from abroad, not sure if they give you extra time to do this or not.  A lot will depend on his/her academic level of French, and also German.  In VD, French, Maths, and German are the 3 pillars used for the streaming.  I think you will find the culture of CH local schools very different from international schools.

			Montessori schools have a very definte philosophy and style of teacing/ encouraging the development of skills, even though some of her ideas are now deeply embedded in many other EY educational centres and schools.    
Before commiting to one, I suggest you do some reading on the Mntessori methods especially on how the various apparatus ( standard resources) are used. It suits a lot of, but not all children and not all families.      
ZIS has quite a  different approach though the enquiry - based programme of the PYP curriculum. I personally love this approach, but again it is not necessarily the best for everyone. ( you will find plenty of information  online. )   
It's hard to compare the two because along with the totally different approaches, there are also individual schhol and teachers styles to take into account.    
If you happen to be anywhere the ACS Egham campus school (A30 towards Virgina Water) then arrange to have a look at the pyp  in action with their youngest schildren and see if you can talk to someone there about the philosophy of learning amd the attitudes that the PYP encourages.

			Thanks DrMom - that totally tallies with my experience as well. I spent a year deep in the countryside in the south-west of France and came back bilingual with some friends for life as a result of making every effort to embrace and experience the local way of life rather than taking my UK habits with me. 
Guess just wanted to get some comfort that it's like this here and that making an effort will pay off, given it's the kids and my wife as non-german speakers that will be taking the brunt of the direct decision to move here!   
The Kanton's education department were very helpful and did say that the system is set up to help non-German speakers integrate so I'm certainly hopeful that all will go well!

An extensive investigation by Le Matin Newspaper has shown that these suspicions of plagiarism are far from trivial.

The book (first published in 2006, price: CHF 30.--) whose reading is required for obtaining a master's degree at University of Neuchatel in  international business development - has reproduced copies of an article of the magazine  ""Jeune Afrique"", published two years ago. The Canton Neuchatel Minister in charge of Education, Philippe Gnaegi has confirmed the alleged accusation of plagiarism: ""If plagiarism is confirmed, we will crack down.""

			I don't think anyone is trying to convince you that to be the youngest is better.  However it really doesn't make that much difference, and it makes less and less difference the older the kids get.    
My youngest daughter, is in the Swiss system, where in Baar the school year is March 1-Feb 28th, her birthday is late January, making her one of the youngest in her class too. She is in the regular Swiss First Class and loves it (she would have been really upset if anyone had suggested she should repeat Kindergarten 2 and seen the rest of the""big kids"" go off to school while she had to join the ""little kids"").  She is top of her class in Maths and reading, and her teacher says her written German reads as if German was her first language. If they are ready for school they are ready wherever their birthday falls.   
My older two kids are also amongst the youngest in their respective years and it has never been any sort of disadvantage at all.

1224	16.03.2013, 22:02	Newbie	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: Zurich	"     Thanks for writing a more informative post. I can't really remember seeing 'intense criticism of international schools' as a general rule. Certainly there is support for local schools - newcomers do not always realise that so much help can be available for children lacking the necessary language skills for their 'age group'. Also many do not know how very expensive International Schools are. However, it's true that there are sometimes running battles on here pro and contra a specific school and sometimes. at least, for the very reason I implied. A school doesn't suit one person's child and the school is blasted on here.   There are then posts from several 'half a dozen posts to their credit' members, who say how wonderful it is. Checking their profiles, if you are quick enough to do it before the relevant info gets removed!! it might be that they teach there. In other areas on here we've had people praising a firm's work to the skies - the only catch being that the writer was the owner of the firm!    
None of this helps a newcomer who really needs advice. No school system is perfect and, as you say, the downside of international schooling can be the lack of contact to other children in the neighbourhood. The school holidays aren't the same and the language skills may still be lacking after a longer period of time.    
A big plus in the international sector is that, for most children, it would be easier to fit in and catch up working in a language they already speak.     
So, back on topic - sorry for the interruption.

			1. You can start with people in your neighbourhood. Local kids will come for english courses and not ones going to international schools. You can check at places like Migros, Coop for advestisments.   
2. You can't run a business without taking the required approvals. Please visit your kries buro.   
hope it helps.

			It sounds like you are a solid student with very good grades and a good work ethic. I wouldn't get too worked up about a few percentage points. From my experience, a well thought cover letter with a brief project proposal (related to the work in the group, but building something new), and strong grades in the specific areas a group is looking for.   
I can't say if it matters to a scholarship committee, but once you get it, I suspect many groups would be happy to have a student with their own money.

			I did a lot of research about FMS in Switzerland that offer theater arts as a major subject and found one in Winterthur (which is connected to the FMS Zürich Nord) and one in Basel. Does anybody have any experience with one of these schools?   
My son is in the FMS Zug, they only offer social science, health care, and educational science; he would like to major in theater arts, hence the question.

			Hi there, I am an Australian studying at the University of New South Wales, doing an Actuarial Science degree. For my Masters, I am thinking of applying to ETH Zurich under their Mathematics degree, majoring in Actuarial Science, or at the University of Lausanne.   
I do, however have some questions. Are the courses taught in ETH Zurich in English? Also, what is the pathway for the institute of actuaries in Switzerland?

			Hello all,   
Can anyone recommend a grammer book for my 12 year old daughter. She sits in english class but as she is much more advanced the teacher lets her read a book in English. She is currently finishing the last of the hunger games trilogy.   
I would like to find a good grammar book with exercises so she can do some self study under my supervision. She speaks excellent English but I think it would be good to learn the basics properly.    
Any ideas would be much appreciated as I am sure some of you out there have been through this rite of passage.   
regards

			Take a look at this chart of gymnases in 2012-2013:     
It shows which gymnase in canton Vaud offers which ""options spécifiques"" (majors) and ""options complémentaires"" (minors). However, the major and minor are only 2 out of 13 subjects. The maturité is a broad qualification and all gymnases require all pupils to take the other 11 subjects, in sciences, languages, etc, etc. The actual teaching should not be much different from one gymnase to another.

If you haven't had experience in the French system, it can be a shock!  There is more emphasis on the academic side, then there is on the overall emotional balance of the child.   
There is a good success rate academically but the system is not geared to a rounded education.  There is not a lot of extra curricular activities.  Value for money?  Well it is cheaper then the other international schools, but certainly doesn't have the same infrastructure and facilities.  That being said the school is in the throes of building a new premises, which should be ready in 4 years.  If you want further info you can PM me.

			For something local, your best bet might be to approach the local music schools.           
These schools usually play a pretty central role in music education in an area, as many schools don't offer music classes after a certain level (e.g. in my daughter's school music classes stop after the second class).   
They music schools provide tuition but also usually have lots of groups, including choirs, rock bands, pop bands and so on.   
Chances are some of the kids can speak in English, too, so it's worth trying out, even if just as a starting point.   
I don't know anything at all about these particular schools as I'm not in the area, but going by our local one and what I hear about others, they're probably worth a try!

			So I am ACCA qualified and work for a Big 4 firm in Switzerland.  All my trainees are studying to become dipl. eidgen. Wirtschaftspruefer.  Some of my more junior client contacts are supported in their study to ACCA/CIMA as part of their graduate training programs...so I thought I'd chime in.     
There is  a reason why all professional qualifications like this require an extensive practical experience element.  It is the practical experience that gives you plenty of transferrable skills that allow you to work anywhere in the world, regardless of local legal framework (at least to an extent).    
Even though I qualified in the UK and don't know a lot about the Code of Obligation and Swiss audit standards I can work here easily.  But my portfolio comprises only three clients, two reporting under IFRS and one group of US subsidiaries who need to convert their US GAAP books into Swiss GAAP for their statutory accounts...but I do have a tax team who look at my clients' taxes and plenty of colleagues I can turn to for help if my Swiss GAAP knowledge lets me down...what I could   do is work primarily with clients with Swiss GAAP and tax focus unless I did more training.     
The same is true for my trainees, should they wish to work abroad in the future.  The on the job training they receive and the experiences they gain will stand them in good stead anywhere.  But again they could not do anything that requires strong local regulatory knowledge.  All the professional qualification does is signal that somebody's obtained a certain skill set.  In the case of accounting that often means a lot of transferrable skills...       
But given your educational background and experiences passing a few ACCA modules while you learn German won't help you become more employable.  You need somebody to give you a training contract so you can get the practical experience.  As far as employability goes it would matter little if this was with an audit firm (dipl. eidgen. Wirtschaftspruefer - although I think the courses for this would be in German or French), or some kind of graduate program in industry, where even Swiss multinationals have been known to offer ACCA or CIMA study support as part of the package.     
So if this is something you want to do find out about graduate programs.  With the large international companies in Basel, the fact that your German is not fully up to scratch may not be an issue.  At least it doesn't seem to matter with the international firms I work with.  YMMV.   
Of course your time would be equally well spent learning German because that would make you more employable, outside the world of multinational finance teams.

			Damn, why isn't there a private bilingual montessori where I live?! There is a primary montessori but it is terrible. I am also interested in Rietberg although it is a bit far from us. There is also d'Insle there I see. One thing I am interested in is if they really do shift away from the punishment/praise paradigm most mainstream schools use and if they use really respectful/empathic ways of communicating with kids. Because not all montessoris I have visited do. You really have to trust your gut at the end of the day.

			Thanks for your help!!! It's all a bit confusing because I am not used to this system, as far as I know in my Country there are only Universities and Polytechnics. There are of course professional schools but only for A-levels.  
Now I know that HES focuses on applied research, which is what I am interested in really    
I just sent my application so for now it's only a remote possibility....but I will think carefully before moving  !! Also, I have a regular Master Degree from a European University so I am not even sure I can be accepted there!   
Sion seems really pretty, but I suspected it could be a bit boring to live in... (Thanks CaroleAy for confirming it  ). However if I do get the position I can maybe find a place somewhere else, I don't my commuting (it takes me an hour now to get to Uni!).   
Thanks again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

			Hi,   
A little late in reply...We had our children in ISSH, moved them to the local schools. You will get huge support in the german language. To be honest, I asked my kids after 3 months, where they preferred, without any hesitatation...local school. We have seen there grades go back to pre international school, and they are now excelling themselves. 
An additional language skills (German/French/English), what a start...   
End of the day your choice,

			Have you read through EPFL's website? You might start  , being sure to check into the admissions requirements for students from Columbia via  . Then you can address your questions directly via the  .   
EPFL is a very challenging academic environment. A significant percentage of students do not make it through the 1st year, so you will need to be prepared to work very hard.    
Be sure your language skills are sufficient for the level you will actually need in the classroom, rather than just reaching the B2 level. I have been in French classes with students from UNIL and EPFL who had B2 level French but it was not enough for them to be able to keep up academically. They were taking a break from school to improve French before continuing working towards their degrees.

Drama for example is not accepted at such prestigious places like ETH, however it is a very demanding subject in the IB when taught appropriately. When one makes their IB choices, they should be working very closely with their counselor to make sure that the choices they make are not limiting their access to their future university choices.  
BTW, in no way did I mean ETH limits one choices and sorry if that is how it came across, I thought that saying it is in the top 5 unis in Europe and maybe number 3 behind Oxford/Cambridge would show the I value it highly. the point of limiting is why stay in counrty and limit when there is the whole world to conquer, especially when one is taking the IB and involved in international mindedness.  hope my ""tragic"" comment is rectified...

			Based on your child's age, I wouldn't be too concerned about transcripts. At that age, grades are more of a pass/fail than A-F. I think once you know where you'll be you can contact the school district directly and ask for requirements and/or a placement test if necessary.            
You can consider charter schools also if you are not comfortable with regular public schools, and you can even homeschool if you would like. I often have the feeling that the U.S. is more flexible than CH when it comes to education choices for your kiddos.

			My son who is much older goes to International School of Central Switzerland, but he started when he was around 7.  They have a great Pre-K program.    is not bilingual but German is taught, and integration in the local community is encouraged and fostered.  One of our Russian Families works with a teacher in the school from Russia to provide her children with private language lessons.  There are 2 Russian language schools in Zug.  They meet one day a week on Wed I think. 
I like our school because of the small class sizes and the individual attention each child gets.  We do get families coming from the much larger schools and they are happy with the switch.  I know of one family who left for four forest.  They are mostly happy with it, but the son is not and still mentions his old school.  The schools offer trial days so I would suggest to try them out.

currently thinking to do the PMI examination for project management. Do not really need the qualification, but project management is one of the skills that I would love to develop or have good information about.

1292	04.02.2013, 18:23	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: it seems it will be Zurich	"    This is the most logical way, and it will be most probably suggested to OP's child, should the child show progress in German, academic results and maturity in terms of weighing options career wise.    
There is very little chance to hop in the system and try for Maturite, when not at least a decent level of local language at 16. Your child can be 17 or 18, even, to enroll to Gymnase, but needs to write a letter to get an approval.    
OP, I found  a l , it depends on the commune and canton if the child will be put in a bienvenue class (boot camp local language), 10th year, or will be lucky enough to repeat 10th year while being reassessed and streamed.    
In the list I linked, look at  , it seems like a place your child would like. I have no idea who pays these 10th years in specialized schools, in our cantons the preproffesional schools with 10th year are canton financed, mostly. You have to contact them and see, contact the cantonal center for post obligatory schooling and discuss your options there. It is a serious thing, you need as much info as you can obtain.    
Professional Maturite is in my opinion the best option for your child since it takes longer (is harder but more prestigeous and usable) and your kid will have time to adapt and get good level of local language. When she has that, she can study undergrad and then grad programs, a lot of it is in English these days (undergrad mostly in local language if you want the local public system).      Those old tests are only written parts. The student has to pass an oral exam, too, all in the local language (for all the disciplines). Only is she gets 20 points for written exam she will be exempt from orals, last year we had 2 students pass without orals in the entire canton (one was mine, woohooo.....bless you, M).    
This is all for the canton Vaud, though.

Kinderkrippe here in the area costs 105-130 chf (not 150-200), but you have to ask if they have available places. Spielgruppe costs less (10 chf per hour)

			Bilingual ones (English and French) for 2 year olds include Club Alpha (in Pully), and Micki's (Pully/Lausanne border). 
L'Ecoline in St Sulpice is bilingual (but start at age 3 I think).   
Off the top of my head, I can only think of one English-only choice, and that's the International School of Lausanne. I believe they start at age 3.   
I don't know anything specific about these places - our kid briefly went to a French speaking garderie in Lausanne, and is now at the local (French speaking) kindergarten.   
For socialisation and play (if you don't mind this being in French), there are numerous garderies, and you can get a full list of these from the BIP in Lausanne (Bureau d'Information aux Parents).

I do not get your analysis of the problem. 
1) The existing standard of 14/20 in a scientific bac is not ""not-so-smart"". The new standard of 16/20 is extremely good. 
2) Neither do I see the relevance of rich parents. My son is at University in Grenoble. The difference in costs between that & Lausanne is not so great for me (I am talking spoilt brats here, Grenoble COULD be cheaper, but it isn't). 
3) Remember that half the Swiss pupils fail their first year exams at EPFL. This is scarcely better than the French University system (i.e. not ""Grandes Ecoles"", where the dropout rate is very low). A naive analysis of that statistic suggests that the French kids are not depriving many successful Swiss.   
PS I have to share a related story. ZappaJr also thought of doing his 3rd year in Edinburgh. The fee structure then was: Scottish & European students: free; English students: £4,000/year  .

The first is French, the second is bilingual French/German (both my girls went there and I can highly recommend it). I have a feeling there is a French/English playgroup in the centre commercial les Dailles, but I can't find a link to it.   
Good luck, and welcome to VsG  .

			I'm not sure that I would agree that ""Haut Lac is academically stronger than the other private schools around"" as mim says.  Perhaps it is true at the lower levels, but I know that the IB results for their senior students were not very good a few years ago.  Disclaimer:  I'm slightly biased because my children had extremely positive experiences at SG's.  I usually advise parents to visit all of the schools in the Vevey/Montreux area, if possible, because the schools have a distinctly different ""feel"".  For families with older students, I would enquire about where their students matriculate and the college guidance services provided by the school.  Selecting a school is a very personal choice - what works for one family does not always work for another.

			I think anyone with a child who has 'special needs' and is not in the local school (in Zurich) should also download this document:   
Link here:     
Go down the list and find the document called ""Therapien für Privatschüler und -schülerinnen.    
It's essentially a policy document that states, amongst other things, that psychotherapy, physiotherapy and speech therapy are the responsibility of the Gemeinde, even for children in private schools.   
Actually, there are lots of very important information documents (in German) on that page....well worth reading if your children are in a private school in Zurich, or if you are considering that option...

1313	02.01.2013, 21:11	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Manchester	"    I disagree on the fact that swiss German is another language. It's nothing more than a German dialect,  a very strong dialect but it's not a different language. There are a few Helvetismen (words only used in Switzerland), and normally, children learn both words for carrot i.e., even though they will never really use the high German word outside school. But all the books they read and most movies they watch will be in high German and therefore it is totally normal for them to learn both.    
Teachers will speak and teach high German in school. A few years back, they only spoke it during German, Maths and Natural studies. Now, they are advised to speak German in other subjects as well, and so they do.

I went to school in CH so as far as I remember I think you need some indoor shoes and some special gym shoes. Maybe some colors pen, little things like that but I think it's for primary school.

			Hi,   
My wife and I live in Kreis 3 between Schmiede Wiedikon and Kalkbreite.  We are looking for a good creche for a 5 month old child.  3-4 days per week.  It can be English or German speaking.  The parents are American and Italian.   
We are most interested in    
1. Cleanliness 
2. Ratio of caretakers/children 
3. Lots of interaction with young babies. 
4. Attention to crying child (not that they are left crying for hours) 
5. Pref outdoor area 
6. Creative staff (arts, music, etc) 
7. Multinational environment would be great   
We live nearby and I work from home so can be reached pretty quickly if there are any issues during the day.     
Thanks

			There are lots of English-speaking families living in Mannedorf or nearby. You'll probably find that your eldest, if going to local school, will be in a class with other English-speaking kids.   
As for playgroups, I know there is one in Stäfa, but I'm not sure which morning. Otherwise, there is the Apple Tree in Erlenbach ( ), a centre with playgroups and other activities. There are probably other playgroups happening as well, and the best way to find out is to join the yahoo groups (families-in-zurich and expat-moms-in-switzerland), which have lists of all the playgroups, both in and out of Zurich.    
I'm in Meilen, which isn't too far away, and there is a regular coffee morning here for English-speaking women (kids welcome). When we moved to Meilen three years ago I didn't know anyone at all, but I've since met some really lovely people and we feel very much at home. My daughter is in the local school and we have a nice mix of locals and English-speakers in our neighbourhood. I'm pretty sure Mannedorf will be like that, too.   
Anyway, feel free to send me a PM (private message) if I can help once you get here!

In the past, what was ""taught"" was at the discretion of the teachers, (or orders of the Head)  some of whom knew the developental needs of ones so young, and some who didn't.  Fortunately, there is now a curriculum that is playbased and child centred, if followed.  More like, but not totally the same, as the NZ  kindergarten programme.   
So, neither quite fits the situation that the OP has come from in NZ.

Thanks a lot Kodokan and Music Chick. There weren't any places in the class of the same age for my 9 year old, but I will send the school some examples of my seven year old's work so that at least they know what kind of work he is doing and ask them to check that decision.

I agree with you, UK curriculum willl be ahead of ISB that's why I tend to admit in this school (ofcourse, the proximity convenience).   
Woiuld you mind to enquire little bit more information from your colleagues who have their kids in school. My kid is about 7 years this septemeber. How will the study for that age group in this school.   
Thank you very much in advance!

			Hi,   
Have just finished describing our decision on a previous thread, but as you want to know specifically about International school fees....   
Of the four children we brought with us to Switzerland, we only sent the oldest (aged 12 at the time) to the local International School. The other three went to the local village school and have done really well there, learning German/Swiss German, playing with friends in the village and having a fantastic time.   
Although we have a substantial income, the International School fees have nearly crippled us over the two years that our son has been there. So we have taken the decision to send him back to the UK for the next academic year. Although there were other factors in the decision, the cost of the fees had the greatest influence, because they increase as the child moves up the school.    
For people who don't get relocated by their company, and who therefore do not get their children's fees paid for them, it is extremely expensive, and there is no significant reduction for child no. 2 or 3, either.    
On the upside - as mentioned already by others - I was very isolated here and have made no real friends in the village. Everybody I have met has been very friendly, but the people I have grown closest to are all people (both Swiss and foreign) who I have met through the International School.   
The other point to mention, is that here at least, it is very difficult for mothers to earn a good salary if they are also responsible for childcare. Of our three children in local school, they only attend school from 8.20 to 11.50 every day. In the afternoons each class only goes to school for one day a week, so I have at least one child at home from midday every day of the week. Parents who choose the International School are more flexible in that respect, as the hours are a straight 8.20 to 3.15 every day except Wednesday. But many still need to employ a childminder or nanny to cover the rest of the full-time working week, which combined with the school fees probably covers most of your earnings.   
Best of luck with whatever you decide.
