I find that really weird, yet this isn't the first time I've heard this. Wow.   
Maybe I'm just too friendly and pay the bills   at least I don't live in fear of Billag Man... I actually enjoy watching the TV, and although I admit it IS expensive, other taxes seem quite reasonable compared to neighbouring countries. Swings...roundabouts...   
(Although I have nothing but contempt for Billags customer service and the obstacles they place to prevent you from righting their wrongs. It's often easier to pay the bloody bills than contest unfair billings. Swine!)

There are many ways one can receive television programs in Switzerland. Many of the subscription services in Switzerland offer a reasonable range of English-language programming. You can find out the channels offered, availability and pricing information for each of the above services on their official websites.       
All persons capable of receiving television and radio signal in Switzerland are obligated to pay licensing fees to Billag. Yes,   even if you don't watch Swiss TV, and there's not a whole lot you can do about it. It's the law, and you will be served a hefty fine if you don't pay up.       Satellite television reception in Switzerland   
Satellite television is enormously popular with many foreigners living in Switzerland. It is possible to receive these channels for free through Sky or Freesat. The following threads in Englishforum cover most of the details concerning installation* of a satellite dish in Switzerland and what channels you can receive. Sky TV Facts: 
*A few notes about installing satellite dishes in Switzerland: 
Some landlords are against the installation of satellite dishes on their property. There is a federal law that explicitly states that you have the right to receive foreign language television programs (including those broadcast by satellite), but many landlords prohibit the installation of dishes because they destroy the property. 
If you are refused permission to mount a dish on your building, there are a few options.    The above solutions won't prevent the neighbours from complaining that your dish is ugly, but they do save you from getting in trouble over damaging the building.

			@Macer that's good news - I have the logitech hub as well.    
On a sidenote: the UK version of the Echo doesn't work with IFTTT at this time. I was able to connect the channel on IFTTT without a problem, but it won't execute any commands. IFTTT says that the European versions will be supported at a later date. That somewhat blows :-/   
Oh, and ""one more thing"": the Echo app is only available in the UK and US app stores (both on Android and iOS), so you'll need an account from on of those stores to set up the Echo. It can also be set up through a website / in your browser, though.   
Also, any existing US Echos will be switched to the European software automatically - which means those with US Alexas lose their IFTTT integration as well. Not sure if that'll also happen if the device is in Switzerland, rather than the UK or Germany.

Most internet awareness advice given out by schools advocate parents as the most effective barrier and not allowing kids to surf behind closed doors.  When you have multilingual kids, preselected parental controls are a piece of cake to get around.   
All our devices are wifi access only so sneaky playground surfing doesn't work.

Also using a wired connection is mostly faster than using WiFi, which helps an awful lot if you're frequently transferring large amounts of data.   
But apart from that you're right.

			I think DAZN only have the german region rights, which is why Swisscom / Teleclub can show the games with French commentary on the SFR1 channel.   
I've signed up to DAZN this weekend and have seen the quality of the catchup is fantastic but the live games can be a bit hit and miss. The german commentary is ok and I think I can put up with it    
DAZN has no champ league / Europea League rights, correct? Do you know if Swisscom TV still have these on PPV?

			If you're planning in staying in your apartment for more than a year, always get fiber optic. Init7 in ZH will do you a nice deal, for barely more than the Swisscom 250Mbps package.   
And to the ""you don't need that bandwidth"", there's no such thing as too much bandwidth. And more allows you to run a business from home, for example.

You pay $90 for cable and internet, plus whathever you spend on cellphones.  
But an inlimited plan for 4G is 65,00 each phone.

I ended up calling customer service and they reset the line, apparently they saw there was some kind of error on their part. I will have to see if things are. Good to know about the reheating issue. I actually have hung my modem/router on the wall, to try and obtain a better signal, and I think that helps. I do not think it is a good idea to enclose it under a heavy desk or in a media cabinet, and I did some research on the best placement. Getting it up higher in an unblocked location helps it, apparently. Cheers!

			I am living in Zürich and always have great signal with Lycamobile, so not sure it is because of their system when abroad. Still it is really strange, now sometimes I cannot even call international numbers because I get the message that the number does not exist, when I am sure that the number is correct. Lyca really offers amazing deals, but this kind of stuff annoys me. Is anybody experiencing the same behavior?

			Well, after a few days with the GearVR and it's a pretty cool demonstration of the way consumer VR is heading. The main issue is that the resolution isn't good enough and needs to be higher, with a 4k screen as a minimum but ideally 8k would make for unpixellated viewing. I guess that's still a couple/few years away from that though.   
Either way it gives a cool effect in the demos and apps that are there and it will only get better as the production/filming techniques improve. I spent Sunday afternoon watching the ""Shorts"" (short movies, basically) in the Oculus store and they were great (even though they are mostly 2D), I highly recommend going through each and every one in sequence, there are some amazing concepts in them. Very cool.   
I also love the effect of using the ""Cinema"" setting, it really does feel like you are watching a big screen, albeit heavily pixellated. When the resolution increases it's going to be simply amazing. Same with Netflix, it's just too pixellated to be viable at the moment.   
Consumer VR in general is going to be amazing in a few generations, the possibilities for content are almost endless.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2009	Groaned at 529 Times in 401 Posts	VR Headsets (Gear VR, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Playstation VR etc etc...)	Richdog	Posts: 9,278

			Went from M-Budget to Coop Mobile few months ago. CHF 30 for unlimited calls/sms/data was very inviting lol...   
I sign up at a Coop Kiosk, opted to port my number. The lady seems confused and i already knew there would be a problem. She however sent all documents using Fax to Salt. Then an SMS was sent by Salt to me, welcoming me as their new customer. It assigned me a new number instead of porting my old number. Oh Dieu! ...  
Then some long calls and a return trip to the coop kiosk were made to sort out the problem..   
The unlimted calls/sms are pretty ok for your wife i guess. It also offer unlimited data whic 
The thing i dont like is that, the signal is not really good. It often goes blank for me both at work and home...

			I have SALT (for internet), Swisscom as workphone and my better half has Sunrise (via Aldi MVNO). At my home Salt has best coverage from those three (on salt I get 4G with full range on swisscom only 3G+). Overall from experience I wouldn't say any of those 3 providers is visibly better than other... so in this case I go with who has best offer and here salt wins considerably.

			Happy onwer of a skylake XPS13 for the last 6 months.   
Only two complaints 
-the spacebar can be annoying 
-sometimes for no apparent reason it will wake up with the lid closed. It comes and goes, quite a rare occasion actually, but annoying when it happens as it drains the battery. I don't know if it's mine or a general XPS13 thing. Previous windows update fixed it, last one re-surfaced it. Checked all power in Win and BIOS and couldn't see what's wrong. Again, it's a rare thing, so no biggie.   
Other than that stellar machine.   
Easily 8+h of normal use which I find plenty since the charger is tiny and packs well.

			So there is this virtual cellular provider called   (using Swisscom network). 
I know their rates are not the best, but we are a family who: 
 - mostly calls other people from a flat-rate home/landline phone;  
 - we call each other and the home phone frequently, but these are usually brief calls. 
 - parents use up to about 1GB each of data on cellular network. 
 - three kids would probably be fine with voice and maybe sometimes data.   
Therefore I thought Mucho makes sense because: 
 - calls (up to 10min) within network and to 5 chosen fixed numbers are free. 
 - 1GB of data (optionally auto-renewable)  is 10 chf per per month.   
I plan to spend monthly about 20 per each parent phone, and close to zero for each kids' phone.   
Any bed experiences with Mucho? Or better deals for such a use case?

Bandwidth costs money in the sense that equipping a neighbourhood with lines, line concentrating devices, and a trunk to the nearest exchange. This ""package"" will be selected to deliver a certain minimum to each end user, and a certain amount of additional bandwidth to cover customers with greater bandwidth needs, and the whole package with a certain reserve for growth.   
This whole package can handle a certain finite amount of bandwidth, and incurs a specific capital cost.   
It doesn't cost Swisscom any more to deliver you 500 than 20 as long as the package can handle that, they simply ""unthrottle"" the port your apt is connected on - this is done via software from a central location.   
But when the number of customers with higher speeds starts to increase to the point that they need to install additional kit to cover that demand, then it starts to cost them money. They may need to upgrade devices, or possibly even start pulling new lines. This can get very expensive very quickly.

			Just that you do not pay to much: 
There are two Bilag license. On is the radio license which covers radios only and there is a TV license which covers TV only.   
Legally speaking, you will need a radio license when you have a AM/FM or DAB radio. Any radio. In your car, in your phone, in your alarm clock. Also if you have a internet connection at home and you have a device capable of receiving internet radio streams (from anywhere in the world).    
You will need a TV license if and only if (aka iff):   
- You have a TV set which can receive TV (connected to cable socket, connected to a Sat receiver, or has a built in DVB receiver and antenna If you have an old TV with just an analog tuner connected to a DVD player you wont need a TV license).  
- Or you have computer AND a subscription or account with an IP-TV provider (paid or free). An IP-TV provider allows you to watch real live TV stations (from anywhere in the world). Netflix or Amazon Prime are NOT IP-TV providers. Streaming does not need a TV license. A computer alone does not need TV license. (There are also live TV streams where you do not need an account or a subscription. Like the Swiss state TV! If you watch it through their website you do not need a TV license!!)    
As you already in the grips of Billag, select Radio only.     
Also and most importantly, the license is per household and you can have as many devices as you wish. If you live in a shared flat you will only need one license and can share the cost with your flat mate(s).

I guess something similar next time

And if it turns out that a wire needs to be connected, or a port number determined, then choose one of: 
a) Figure out out yourself and connect the line, or find out the port. 
b) Find someone who already knows and ask nicely. 
c) Pay someone who knows how to do this, an electrician for example.   
I would say you should probably now read up on how you go about returning the Sunrise kit.   
This would still leave you with the problem of whoever you do choose as a provider being able to figure out which two wires are actually connected to the jack in your apartment.   
It might be simpler and cheaper for you if you call Sunrise, ask them to uncancel your line, keep the kit, and find out what the previous tenant's phone number (perhaps by asking the landlord or a neighbour, and explaining why it is that you need this information).   
But if you want to stand on principle and save some money by living without an internet connection, that is your good right.

			unfortunately Swiss Post Box changed into E-Post and 1) killed the ability to non-residents to use the service and 2) raised prices from ""free"" to min. 20chf per month.   
Sucks.. I liked an used the service and now I will have to keep it on for 3-4 months until I change all incoming addresses to my real address.   
But as for you, since you mentioned to own properties here, you should be able to register for the service with your property address AND use the scan solution on an ongoing basis... why not?

I called them to complain, but was told the date and time I had enrolled on, and the details of my use of their service - dates, timings etc. But it was all untrue. But how to prove it?   
It was someone at Swissom who told to speak to Ombudscom - who seem to exist to arbitrate such matters. Once all the necessary questions on their forms had been filled in, and bills from SC sent etc they contacted NTH Media.  
  Then, as I wrote ""I received notification from 9292 that I would be repaid my payments if I did not proceed further with my case"" by email, but with no reply possible. That was the day following the completion of the detailed form to Ombudscom plus details of the payments made to Swisscom for 9292's alleged services to me. But no recognition of wrongdoing on 9292, nor Swisscom!

Swisscom's own explanation when I asked them was that it's because the call has from a different network. As the only people that ring me are in Switzerland and mostly on Swisscom as well so doesn't happen often and not worth switching to roaming, and I mostly use it for texting.

			I just got my Horizon box under 20hours after ordering by telephone. I did not really want to order it, but due to a technical call, the hotline guy offered me this for ""free activation fee"". Delta from my current monthly is +10chf.   
Then this happened. 
1. I was due for an automatic upgrade from 50k kbits to 75k kbits without any Horizon deal.  The call center guy told me to wait until the upgrade happens (1 April) and then install my new Horizon box. I said yes and I knew it is bad if I install over Easter weekend. No support.   
2. The horizon box came with postman under 20 hours (yesterday morning). I left it in the box.   
3. My cablecom TV Mediabox froze up tonight at 21:00.  It said ""installation will be complete in 30 mins"" and remained blue screen for long time.  Letter in new Horizon box warned that current TV box connection will be disabled ""soon"".   
4. I have no choice but to install new Horizon box because Cablecom hotline at 21:00 on a Good Friday is dead. Just music.   
5. I installed the Horizon box, smooth installation. HD TV all works etc.   
Now comes the surprise. Internet and telephone on the Horizon box does not connect.   
I have to replug in my current cable modem (with internet and telephone) back into another socket in the wall.   
I guess I have to wait til the cablecom company activates my internet and telephone on my new Horizon box.  When? 
Seeing it is Easter weekend, I am expecting more cock-ups.       
PS: GUI sucks. Missing many direct buttons on controller and navigating thru the Menu is painful, almost like the old Handphone internet version 1.0. (I cannot even remember the name of this service).   
However, the box is surely faster and more responsive. New Hardware. By Samsung.    
PPS: I am not complaining because I know such things can cock up.  Just wanted to share the experience.

In the past Swisscom (w/o a dot) used to offer landlines after you have paid a hefty deposit of ~CHF 2000.    
But Swisscom is not the only landline provider, others are:       
(Migros M-Budget is handled by Swisscom)   
Other options is not using the landline but the tv cable, you can find your cable tv provider here:

If a large group of people at once move from one cell to the next do the first few get a good connection and the last ones not. It sounds stupid but it really makes a difference WHERE on the train you sit - if you are in the first carriage will you most likely get a good Swisscom connection, if you are in the last most likely not. Since Salt has a lot fewer subscribers can I imagine that the difference is much smaller.

Try this category, you might need to have some patience, but there are really very good deals that can be had there.          Warranty is overrated. Computers are quite reliable these days. If it worked fine already for two years, chances are it'll last much longer. For a brand new laptop you do need the warranty though - to cover DOA and not obvious from first sight issues or early failures. And if it does break in the end, you can buy again another laptop or two, and still spend less that what a single new laptop would've costed you.   
As I've already mentioned above, second-hand Thinkpads in my opinion are especially exceptional price/quality wise.

			Have been using Zattoo since it was in Beta version.  Now I count 19 U.K channels eg. all the BBC, and in addition huge amount of all the usual English speaking news, sports channels etc. in HD.   
I have recording capabilities of up to 500 recordings, 7-days catch-up TV and no Zattoo advertising for CHF 65.00.- p.a. (although I see it has slightly increased since then, still cheap in my opinion).   
Even using a VPN I've not been able to play from the iPlayer since a few months due to the country restriction, but I can view everything else i.e. what is playing - so I just look it up and record it on Zattoo.  Done.   
I believe really, that for the current fees for the premium subscription i.e. no. channels, HD quality, no Zattoo advertising and recording that for CHF 27.- for 3 months or 95.- for the year - Zattoo is a choice I'm really happy with.  That coupled with Netflix and I'm never lost for something to do on a rainy weekend.

			You could also try:    
Costs £29.99 per month, and has all the Sky Sports, Sky Movies, BT Sports, Sky Box Office etc etc. included.    
I've been using this for about a month now. Easy set up and has worked well so far

			I've been using Prime on a Fire stick for a few months now with a US IP, using unlocator smartdns.  It works very well!   
In order to set up the account without having a US-issued credit card, I had to buy myself a Prime gift card and create a new account using that card, while connected to a VPN.  It's a bit complicated but I think it was worth the effort.   
There are a few issues related to not having a US-issues credit card... 1) you can't buy anything.  So you can only watch things on Prime.  2) you can't even buy free things - some videos on there are free, but not part of Prime.  Even these require a credit card.   
They also don't ship the fire stick to Switzerland, so I had to use Grenzpaket.ch for that and have it shipped to Austria.   
Really looking forward to the start of the Grand Tour on Nov 18!

			I used the flat connectors to run the cables through windows. Cost wise, I think my dish was like 40 euros, maybe not even. All in for dish, mount and cables less than 150.  Nowhere near the 450 CHF mark for all the stuff.  My Samsung TV has a sat tuner and I was able to change the location settings to UK so that the TV gets freesat program guide and iplayer apps etc.  Can't do that on my LG so I've got a Humax freesat box now.

			Well that didn't go to plan.... All our audio, and network stuff was hunky dory. Then we had a notification of a planned power cut by WWZ, so like a good boy I powered everything down and turned them off the night before.    
When I went to reboot after they turned the juice back on, the LAN/WifI network is fine but the raid only seeing 1 drive so I can't access the media stored on it. The HTS doesn't want to talk to the TV (both Samsung), and the smart hub doesn't work.  I spent an age resetting, rebooting, and praying to Mecca etc but nowt, nada, nein, niet.    
So anyone a bit of a guru with this stuff that can take a look and save me from tearing anymore of my hair out, or can recommend a firm in the Zug Unterägeri area that can help, I would be very grateful... and Mama G is unlikely to do me further bodily harm.

			I had the experience with Sunrise connection. I looked for an electrician myself but after hearing the experiences of my colleagues, I preferred paying the one from Sunrise as it was a fixed price. And he spent quite some time to find the connection in the end (around 2 hours!). 
So I think also asking the neighbors sounds the most reasonable solution to get a trustful person.

The card automatically comes with a UK#, which will always remain active. Other local numbers are free of charge for up to a month. If you want to keep a local number permanently, it´s £ 5/year.   
Catch#1: 
The UK# is a Lyca#, which are (strangely) sometimes more expensive to call than ""normal"" UK mobile #s. If you need a UK#, I recommend porting a ""normal"" UK# to the Togglecard. I did that successfully    
Catch#2: 
Lyca/Toggle doesn´t allow to activate any call diverts. So if you travel to a country which Toggle doesn´t support, you´re in a pretty dire situation. (There are workarounds, but they´re pretty complicated)   
Catch#3: 
Outside of the UK Data is pretty expensive.   
Because of all the catches I don´t use it as my main#, but it still opens many opportunities.   "	considered unworthy	Join Date: Jan 2012	Groaned at 20 Times in 11 Posts	lyca mobile?	Jonesy	Posts: 505

			I am happy with UPC Cablecom, too. Comparing to Swisscom, they have a better helpdesk line, though this seems to be changing as they grow. 
I recommend to speak with them and compare Cable, Fiber and 4G (using cell phone as a modem) options that they may offer.

			I'd suggest to check 4G offers from your cell phone provider. This way, you can use your cell phone as USB and/or WiFi modem. Just upgrade your data plan, and you have your Internet with you, wherever you are. Of course, you need a 4G-capable phone, but most of them can receive 4G these days.

			I've seen that someone has posted that they use their Amazon Fire Stick here in Switzerland to watch BBc iplayer/CH4 etc.  I've been using overplay for the past year on my laptop/ios device and it works great for Sky go etc but I decided to buy a Amazon Fire Stick in order to stream things on our TV (we would like to cancel the expensive Swisscom TV package and use streaming services/now tv in the near future).  The problem I have discovered is that the Amazon fire stick doesn't work in the same way as other devices (e.g ipad) and I'm unable to watch UK based apps.  The only option from Overplay customer services is to buy a specific type of router....does anyone have a vpn/smart dns programme that works with the Amazon fire stick(I have until now not found any!) or is this one of the downsides of the device.

			Hello all,   
I'll be arriving in Zurich next week and since I cannot get a mobile contract until I have my residence permit or foreigners ID, I'm planning on getting a prepaid SIM card as soon as I arrive.    
It seems like the consensus is that Swisscom is, although costly, generally the most reliable mobile service in Switzerland, so I've decided to choose them. I also want to make it as easy as possible to move my phone number from prepaid to contract if/when I decide to make that switch.   
So, if I get a Mucho Mobile prepaid SIM card (which uses Swisscom networks), could I transfer my phone number/etc over to a normal Swisscom contract without any major hassle?    
Thank you!

			Here is what the Billag webpage says about the refund..For the previous years there won't be any refund (see question 2)       
Since 1 April 2015 radio and television fees are no longer subject to VAT. The latest invoices therefore no longer include VAT.   
  For invoices that have already been sent, you will automatically  receive a corresponding credit note on your next annual invoice. You do  not need to do anything.     
This process has been decided by the Swiss Confederation in order to keep the administrative burden to its minimum.         
For  the period prior to 1 April 2015, the responsible federal authorities  (Federal Office of Communications and the Federal Tax Administration)  have decided that it will not be possible to submit a claim for  reimbursement, since the decision of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court  relates to a change in practice. This is why we will not be able to take  your request into account. Thank you for your understanding.

If you've got a spare machine and you want to have a play then go for it. If you've only got your main machine that you need to be productive then stay away for the time being. (That advice is goes for all OSs, not just windows)

Do you know where I can buy   cable for PlayStation 3 in Lausanne?  
PS2 component c. would also be fine if it's of high quality, but PS3 ones are commonly better.   
PS2   cable is also needed.   
Migro Electronics and MediaMarkt have component on their web sites but not in their stores (thanks alot for going there for nothing).   
Is there any used electronic storage in Lausanne, deposit place or something because stores don't have it.   
Web shopping is my last option, if I don't find them in town or surrounding area.

			Ask Sunrise what connection your predecessor had and what your options with them would be, his records should still be available. Other than that there's cable as an option if you have that.

			Finally!! :-)   
I have 3 wifi networks (same config as you, albeit with a different router) and they seem to coexist quite happily.   
I would turn off the non-Cablecom one but I share my wifi with my neighbour and the Cablecom box's range is very poor.

			Since ricardo would take to long, have a look at tutti.ch, can find smartphones in Zurich for 30 .. 40 Sfr. Collect and pay straight away.   
If you need a sim adapter or new sim, then your phone company should give you one ( salt did for me ).

			Quick UPDATE.   
So I was mailing back and forth with Salt and finally they switched me over to the new v2 (as they called it) and also refunded me the CHF 300 roaming charge I had built up earlier without me even having to ask for it.   
In a very nice and civil way I presented them with three options I felt were left and one would be to forward the isussu to the relevant ombudsman and I received an answer within 4 hours (in my favour).   
Back at being a happy camper :-)

			Yes. Dead simple. I found the box. Opened it.  Connected two wires. And now it works perfect. I moved the Swisscom wires over the the other terminal just in case I needed them later. Saved myself a bunch of money. I can't believe they want people to hire an electrician for that. I might as well hire an electrician to plug my toaster into the wall. Finding the box is the hardest part. I knew I found it when I found the box labeled ""T+T""

			In my experience leaving the country can be a reason not to comply with notice periods.    
Often one simply does not have the required lead time in order to cancel the contract as per the conditions.   
But I would argue here that if Swisscom is cancelled Teleclub should be as well at the same time since without Swisscom it will not work.

			Well then just run to Swisscom or Sunrise and pay quite a bit more  
Because that is the choice... I don't know about Sunrise but I am sure the Swisscom network is better than Salt's. But their price is quite a bit higher too.

			I would say wait until Swisscom says if the problem is on their side of the demarc or not.   
Unless the strike was on or very near to the house itself the problem is most likely on the Swisscom side. It will take them a while to locate where the fault actually lies. They normally like to date error rate data for 5 days. They may have to schedule work to replace equipment.

Also bear in mind that not all in-ears are that good at isolation - a pair with dynamic drivers, which tend to be vented, would probably still give you a good idea of external sound as long as you don't play too loud.

As D-Day is rapidly approaching, can anyone recommend a reliable no-frills modem for the basement? Wifi range is not an issue as it will basically be serving one room, but it should be easy to set up and be able to handle gigabit speeds. It will be wired to a gigabit switch, my PC and PS4 (and possibly a printer). I was looking at   (from Digitec, not Amazon), but the reviews aren't exactly stellar. It gives you a good idea of the functionality I need though.

I won't get it out of the packet until my better half can help me as it's simply too big for one person and I'm scared of breaking it. From the one I saw in store however, the curve is very gentle and it's so so thin... even on a crappy in-store stream it looked good. The panel was also pretty uniform. God knows whats going to happen when I put Game of Thrones on... I'll probably accidentally all over myself. Ahem.    
For the money this simply can't be beaten in terms of specs, the vastly inferior models are only a couple/few hundred CHF less and they are half the TV this is.

			Hi All,   
Moving to Basel Land and with it a move from Cablecom, who have been perfectly fine as a service provider for tv, phone and internet.    
Any experiences with InterGGA? How do they compare with Swisscom? InterGGG are cheaper.. but does that come as a cost? Do they correspond in English, are their internet connection speeds reliable?   
I am concerned mainly with internet, not so bothered about TV and landline.    
thanks for your tips.

			I switched to Swisscom fibre after Cablecom and can confirm I no-longer need to pay the Kablelanschluss fee of about 30chf. However, if you do pay the Anschluss fee, Cablecom may still sell you a modem with 0chf monthly charges. Basically a freebie to stop you closing off the Anschluss, as they still make money that way. So the cheapest package is about 30chf (Anchluss fee paid in your Nebenkosten). Cablecom service depends on the quality of the cabling in the houseIf it is an old house, you can end up with non-stop problems from Cablecom.   
Fibre packages have the lowest latency (eg 1ms Swisscom), if you take 1 level above basic, otherwise it is 5ms or so on the basic Swisscom package. At the cheapest end, Swisscom fibre is pretty good because of the low latencies.   
WWZ and Cablecom cable seem to come in around 10ms latency.   
I recently took out a Salt Mobile 4G Internet contract. This is unlimited internet, download speed varies, but seems to be up to 7mbps down, 2mbps up, more or less the same as entry level cable or Swisscom Fibre, latency seems to be between 35 and 70ms, using my phone as a hotspot. If you are not gaming or trading this might do for home as the latency is probably not noticeable. The monthly cost for unlimited, with 2 SIM cards is 60chf, about the same as a low end Swisscom Fibre package. The cheapest internet out there seems to be a Sunrise PAYG for 7.5chf monthly 250mb on a phone sim 4G, or 15chf monthly for 3g on a data only sim with 1GB download limit at 3G, then after that something painfully slow like 300k, almost but not quite unusable.

			You actually do not own UPC equipment, which is why it must be returned.    
When the equipment was sent to you, they should have provided a postage paid reply label. If you kept the box you can use it to send it back, or you can use any box.    
They are also accept the equipment back at their sales centres.       Do not throw anything away until UPC have confirmed receipt of the returned equipment.   
We have more than one UPC box, but for example the internet only runs from one. Each box is under its own contract. Also, the replay feature on the boxes is not identical. The box which is less expensive has a shorter replay capability.

			Do you want internet for your mobile phone or for your laptop?   
For your mobile phone I can recommend yallo prepaid. You can get the sim-card for 20 CHF. The nice thing is, the 20 CHF are charged as credits on your phone. Then you can get surf bundles by simply sending an SMS. For 1 GB you pay 15 CHF, for 500 MB you pay 10 CHF.  
When you go to holland, you will get an SMS from yallo with an option to activate a roaming package. You can for example get 100 minutes for free for 10 CHF this way. 
So, with your 20 CHF prepaied SIM you could get 500 MB and 100 minutes of free calls in Holland.    
If you are looking for mobile internet on your laptop, then you should get a data stick. I used one some years ago, with an ok price, but I cannot remember which company I got it from. I will try to look it up when I am home.

			If you use Now TV over here, make sure you use a UK credit or debit card as they use that as proof that you're a British customer.   
Also don't use a Chromecast unless you can block the Google DNS numbers to allow the Smart DNS/VPN to be used as otherwise it's geolocked to Swiss pay tv services like Zattoo.    Otherwise, the very nice black box will do nicely.

			So my building got connected to fibre end of February 2016 and I weighed my options:    
- stick with Citycable and pay through the nose to go from 300/20Mbps (80CHF) to 1000/50Mbps (extra 20CHF)  or to symetrical 1Gbps for another 15CHF a month, so a total of 115CHF a month. And that's before you throw in tv stuff. Free installation of OTO box.   
- go for the wingo offer of symetrical 250Mbps at 75CHF/month. Free installation of OTO box.    
- or since I live in Lausanne, go for Saitis.net, a tiny local ISP run by some ubergeeks I used to know back in the day. They offer 1Gbps symetrical for 1000CHF/year or 269CHF/trimester. Which is incredibly cheap! And you get a fixed IP with reverse DNS delegation (important for IRC bragging) and IPV6. This is available    
I ordered saitis.net in mid April and the technician came to my place on the 1st of June (the date I'd chosen for installation) and took about 4 hours to do the cabling and fit the OTO box. Cost: 155 CHF. It's best effort but it works. You need the Fiber7 kit, same as with init7 in Zurich.   
But the connection didn't work as I wasn't getting the DHCP lease. Contacted support and 2 days later (this is a really small op) they checked at the Telco Datacenter and the technician had connected me to VTX instead of Saitis. Once that was fixed I got the a working connexion and speed is pretty damn good.  I still have the Citycable connection+tv box and will decide if that goes down to 2Mbps with TV or just get the cable connection completely cancelled.    
Feel free to ask questions!

			I signed up and whilst I can see you may record for free (to watch later), if I understand correctly they want CHF 13.90 per month to access the live TV streams. If that's the case then between Billag and Cablecom I already pay more than I'd like for TV. For folks without TV, or waiting for a Cablecom connection or something it might be useful - they carry more English channels than Zattoo from what I can see.

			Just choose the cheapest energy. By offering you a choice they admit they are ripping you off.    
Do they really think the public will believe this scam? If 100 % of Swiss customers choose solar power, how will they deliver electricity at night?    
Knowing there is an atomic power station (Mühleberg) 5 miles away, when I lived in the Bern area I chose the cheapest energy. After a month I received a letter from BKW stating that I was a ""scumbag"", as I had chosen the cheapest, dirtiest energy. (Why did they offer it then?)

Yes, the power plugs are different from the North American style. Bring a few US power bars with you, you can change the male plug to a Swiss one, but leave all your components with the originals. Anything that is a media or computer device will generally have a dual voltage power supply built in. Bring at least one power bar for every room, the travel converter plugs are ok when you are on vacation, but it gets old pretty quickly if you are in for the long haul.       
Signal connectors are pretty universal, RCA for audio/video, HDMI, F Coax etc. Although there were a few European connectors (Scart, 5 pin integrated audio) that aren't common in North America, these would only make a difference if you were trying to interface your components with a European Amp or Pre amp, which is pretty unlikely.

A belated massive thanks for posting this deal, I've been on the Freedom SuperMax at 55chf/month for 6 months now with no complaints at all. Good LTE coverage down here in Ticino, and no problems roaming on our many foreign trips.   
Sunrise just sent another sim card for free so the other half can use it in a dual sim phone for roaming data, we had big problems getting Lyca roaming to work on a recent London trip. Plus Sunrise just a text saying roaming data is going up to 2GB from next month.   
Only downside is roaming in Italy it will sometimes not give data unless you manually set it to 3G only in the settings.

When I was testing AV receivers around 5 years ago, I thought that Onkyo and Yamaha were warm and Denon was bright.  Q-acoustics rather neutral.  I chose Yamaha over Denon because I prioritized atmospheric warmness of sweeping lanscape scenes over the metallic sounds of action sequence.  Hope that makes sense?  I think in the last few years though, the dynamic range of these units have improved a lot so warmness and brighness may not be such a difference anymore.     
Do you need 3D? If not, I am trying to sell my Yamaha 2065. And since you have Q-acoustics, a demo at my place makes it easy.

Try to cable and see the speed...   
See random website information:     
In order to get fast speed with wifi you need a lot of things, starting from the right AC wifi device on your computers, the right amount of antennas, the right distance, the right compatible standards between your client and the router, no channel overloading, etc....   
While it's true the latest wifi receivers can go really fast, it implies lot of things (4 external antennas, compatible with high end router, etc...).   
Additionally, with your TWG870UG, it's possible it has little amount of internal antennas, possibly weak chipset, etc...     
In other word, if you want to be sure to have a given speed, you need to do the homework and verify accurately all your wifi chipsets on your laptops, vs the wifi router/modem chipset.   
I could not quickly find the specs of ""TWG870UG"", but I found an older TWG870:   . 
You can see the standards it supports, amount of internal antennas, etc...   
Do the research!   
Maybe you'll find that there are a better combination out there between X modem/router and your laptops. In details, it's the wifi AC standard (latest being 802.11AC), the amount of antennas everywhere (to get more MIMO streams), the compatibility between the chipsets, and a few other details like the physical setup, range, channel saturation...

For the Swiss TV Channels (SRG) you need an viaccess access card, which costs you once CHF 60.00

			The third one, Kabelanschluss you pay for having the cable TV connection to your flat. If you do not use cable TV but instead use TV/Phone/Internet through fibre or the phone plug, you can ask to have the cable TV plug sealed (""plombiert"") and then the landlord should remove the charge from your utilities (nebenkosten).  
If you don't use cable TV, this one is not mandatory. However, in some places there may be a fee for have it sealed. In Basel, I could do it for free.

			I think the SE is a good deal, overall. Though they really should have made an effort to re-design the aesthetics to make it look different to the iphone 5 and include the 3D touch feature, that really would have set it apart.    
Have to say, their phone and tablet lineup is looking cluttered and confusing. At first glance, you cannot tell apart an iPad air 2 vs. smaller iPad pro, ipad mini vs. mini2, iphone 5 vs. SE etc. and what happens with a 2nd generation SE vs. iphone 7 etc.    
Still waiting for the real news.... re-design of the macbook pro lineup and/or a retina display for the macbook air. Come on Apple get your s**t together.

Wingo speeds from 2 days ago are well above 200Mbps. 
Quite impressive. Also Sydney to ZH gets 30/60Mbps. 
Got an SMS notification on the day the service was activated. Installation was a breeze, the TV box works as well, albeit it needs to be plugged into the fiber box directly (no routing in between) to allow it to work.   
So far pretty happy with the results. Customer service works via email, noone available thru the phone.

i do share your thoughts. For me it's kind of a very strong personality infringement. On the other hand i am a bit shocked how easy sombody can catch your number or block it that easy. It is an intervention in to the intimacy of a Person. My co worker confirmed to me 1hr ago that his phone number was never taken to any Kind of buisness Card but shared from his employer to Colleges and suppliers in order to catch him in Holiday etc. Business cell phones was to expansive for him. 
He was forced to give it.

I stopped gaming years ago but I'm really curious to try the recent editions of my childhood favorite game. 
The problem is, I don't want to get back ""seriously"" in that hobby and I don't want to spend 2000 on a good computer just to try a game for a 2-3 evenings.   
Can one rent a gaming pc ?

			re-opening this thread for a question.   
Has anyone here been to any of the locations of the repair-café?    
I have an AV receiver (3 year old) which over night will no longer start. I am fairly ok with Electronics and actually got the schematics and service manual for the device and the voltmeter but still can't figure out what the issue is, I feel it is a simple voltage capacitor which gave-up or was blown! but I need help from a more electric engineer minded person with the right tools.   
Anyway, I was thinking of going to the repair café but was wondering if I am able to speak to them in English (at least when I get stuck in German) as the Electronics tech language in German is not as straight forward.   
I am also open to visit one of the astute EFers here who might be able to assist.

If a future tenant want's to use cable TV, he informs the cable TV provider and they remove the sticker.

first thing I buy is a case for a phone. It protects the phone and if you have to use a crappy phone for work then it also hides the stupid brand symbol. Who cares what colour the phone is as it will be in a case.   
Never had a broken phone/screen.

I suppose we could just send the text and see what happens, but it would be annoying to get charged the 5 Francs and still get roaming charges in France.   	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: Jul 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	French prepaid SIM card	MajorGrubert	Posts: 419

			New Yallo plan:    
Main features:   
- Unlimited calling within Switzerland 
- 1 GB High-Speed (21 Mbps) mobile Internet (if exhausted you can buy 1GB to 10GB data packs) 
- Unlimited SMS within Switzerland   
Price: CHF 19/month during the first six months, afterwards CHF 29/month.   
So it's very similar to Sunrise Freedom Classic, which costs 50.-/month.   
Yallo still offers the Yallo Postpaid plan listed above, which includes free calls to Europe for 39.-/month.

Yeah, but do you actually understand the result of the test you posted? It means that Swisscom has the best network... by a tiny margin. Every day difference to Sunrise and even salt is very small and very individual depending on where exactly you live or work. No provider guarantees you connection indoors and in real life does it in my office matter where exactly your desk is to tell you what network works best. Anyway: Swisscom used to be miles ahead of the competition, Orange was some years ago simply not usable anywhere outside the very city center of Zurich. Sunrise used to be the opposite: fine in the suburbs, but massive bandwidth problems in the city center. These days they all work fine. I am paying 90 CHF a month for the ""absolutely all-in"" contract with salt. The details are somewhere between the Swisscom L and XL pack, so I am essentially saving 50%. That's nearly 1k a year! (and yes, I use it quite a lot to call the EU, so it makes sense for me...)

			Mobile internet is now faster than home WIFI   
Salt sell a tiny device for CHF 19 that you can take in your pocket and which acts as a portable router for up to 32 devices.  It is connected to the Salt 4G network with unlimited data for CHF 35 per month.  It needs re-charging only once a day.   
Speed varies according to your location and time of day.  I was pretty impressed by the speed I got on the train between Versoix and Coppet the other day.   58 Mbps download is faster than I get on the home wifi.   
The result of the speed.test is below:

			You have 39 co-owners. If the problem was caused by some change of the gate (electronics) or similar you should be far from the only one. In this case you were ill advised because the problem was clear from the start as clearly the co proprietaires should have been aware.   
The bill itself seems reasonably/fairly low as often you get billed the actual work time spent plus some predefined time to get to the customer and back, like half an hour. However 100CHF straight could be some predefined amount, e.g. simply because the technician got called regardless of how his efforts and time spent.   
Ask the technician what the actual cause was, there's a good chance he still remembers or took notes. Talk to the co-owners, find out if you are the only one.   
It may be useful to upload a scan of the invoice (personal info removed of course).

			I'm having problems with my Galaxy Note 4 but want to keep it for a number of reasons, so I'm thinking of getting another SIM card from Swisscom with the same number.   
The Swisscom website says that you can do this but it is important that only one handset is turned on at a time.   
Technically there is no reason for this, and in other countries you can turn on both handsets and both ring/receive SMS at the same time.   
Anybody here using the Twin SIM feature with Swisscom, and if so, does it work ok?   
Cheers,

			So as it stands, I intend to do the following: 
Basement: Swisscom Internet Box/router in hallway, Ethernet access in office/guest room (maybe 2, depending on furniture placement in relation to guest bathroom). 
Ground floor: Ethernet access to Swisscom TV, wireless AP/Mac Mini in living room. 
1st floor: Ethernet access to wireless AP on landing   
 All Ethernet access points connected via 25mm conduits and Cat6 cables.   
In addition, 25mm conduits leading to the 3 bedrooms with Ethernet boxes; with or without Cat6 cables initially, depending on cost.   
As a matter of interest, I presume Ethernet and power cables share conduits, correct? I could therefore conceivably have Ethernet access at any electrical point? Not that I would need it mind.

			Hi,   
[Edit: I only saw you've already bought a laptop after I posted, but leaving it here as possible advice for others interested in the same thing  ]   
Have you looked at Amazon UK? They do send at least some laptops to Switzerland, and take care of customs for you (so you don't pay anything yourself). I've done it as well from Amazon US without any problem, though for some reason it's harder to find laptops that Amazon ships from the US to Switzerland.   
Just make sure it's sold by Amazon itself and not an external seller, and that you see ""Import Fees Deposit"" in the final checkout page. This is what Amazon will pay to the Swiss customs for you, so you don't have to pay anything yourself. The program is called  .   
But as an aside, I've been using a Swiss laptop with a US keyboard layout without any problems. I touch type, so having the wrong labels is not a problem for me - if you touch type as well, give it a try.   
The only thing that changes is that the enter key is two lines instead of one, which moves the ""\"" key (that in US layout is above Enter) as well. But it's not a big deal, and it's actually much easier to use than I expected.   
Hope it helps!

			You actually don't need much to stream regular HD youtube or online TV.  20Mbit will be fine and even 10 would work.  Having said that, I have 30 in the UK and sometimes have problems but I think it's to do with the equipment and/or line (Virgin Media ""super"" hub)  The difference you will notice would be in download speeds or if you're sharing the connection with others.

			I'm getting some slightly odd results like that as I'm testing a few more sockets around the apartment.   
I've also got Devolo's Cockpit software open which shows the speed it thinks they're connected at.   
I tried the master-sockets next to the fuse box and that was the highest speed I've seen on the Cockpit software... it was saying they were connected at 450mbit to the basement! Awesome, I thought... let's try a transfer.   
It was all over the place from 4MB/s to 7MB/s.   
OK... try a hall socket... 350mbit on the software, 5-8MB/s   
Hmmm... back to the one I just got the good speeds with to make sure it wasn't a fluke and there isn't an issue elsewhere.   
Software showing 190-210mbit... sometimes peaking to 250.   
Rock solid transfer speed of 10.2-10.4MB/s.   
Looks like I've found the best socket to use... it's fast enough for my needs, so I'll leave it there   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Aug 2014	Groaned at 4 Times in 2 Posts	Network connection from first floor to 1st basement storage room?	dibbles	Posts: 83

All the apps I have which support Chromecast are free, youtube, spotify (without download), zattoo tv, teleboy flipps HD, music player. 
I have Showbox movie app as well which is not in the play store but can be downloaded to your phone from the internet. It has lots of new films and series including Spectre, Creed and more. I've had this a couple of years problem free. To stream their films to the TV I use an app called local cast. 
Netflix also supports Chromecast but requires a subscription. 
I guess what's important is a reasonable internet speed - I have 20Mbs with Sunrise and it works fault free. 
My only cost was the Chromecast stick itself so far but I am a bit of a tight wad! 
Check what apps are available by searching Google. You can see which apps are compatible with android and iphone.

			Do you live near the border? Had a smiliar issue when I was still on Sunrise. Turns out that these boxes have a built-in dead switch if they detect that they're in a different country (they're not allowed to run these outside of Switzerland). So if your local Sunrise antenna is on the fritz, your box might detect a foreign cell signal and kill the connection.    
We live right on the border to Germany - during the first three weeks I had this thing, it just wouldn't work. I called tech support over and over again, they just couldn't figure out what was going on. Eventually, someone told me the last thing they can do is to disable this foreign cell network thing - and bam, it worked.

			So I just called UPC and they were very insistent that I didn't leave them and pretty much refused to let me cancel.   
In the end they've offered 6 months free kabalanschluss and 50% of the internet subscriptions for 3 months. That means my internet 20 goes from 88 to 22.5 per month.  I usually don't like dealing with companies who operate this way so I think I'll likely cancel soon enough anyway.

So far it is enough for me. I have 12+ internet consuming devices at home. Didn't notice any issue.   
Actually I had a look at the picture closely yesterday and it's not that good as at upc. I can see blurring where same picture on upc is sharp. For example, by looking at channel name it can be seen very easy. I will try to make pictures from both upc (they didn't seal the socket yet and it keeps working) and 1tv to show what I mean.

			Actually, I think all of the Verizon USA iPhones have been sold unlocked for a few years due to a deal struck with the FCC. I am not sure about the 5/5S series, but definitely the 6/6S are factory unlocked + they will work on GSM networks and Verizon USA (for some, that is an added bonus). I have a Verizon iPhone 6 and 6+ that I bought in the US and use in Europe, so can attest to this.   
But unlocked iPhones can be bought quite easily from any carrier. However you only have a week, so it might not be enough time to have it sent to you.   
Good luck

			I would go for Surface. The ergonomy of the device is just excellent.   
I have MBP and Samsung Galaxy tab Pro. To be honest 90% of the time i spend using the tablet - mainly reading things but also doing some notes and guess what I am always too lazy to reach for the keyboard, onscreen keybord can be quite good if you get used to it. I saw nice deals at interdiscount for surface 3 this december but I could not justify to myself swithing from samsung to surface.    
One thing to note is that windows still does not cope 100% well with ultra high resolution. Some programs would look on the surface like beeing displayed on full hd only display - the fonts will not be so sharp as they should but many people do not even notice. Overall full hd on 12"" is preaty decent anyway.

			The difference between UK/Irish plugs is that the Earth pin is in the plug and is there if it's needed or not. Most televisions (or all the ones I have seen) don't even use earth (you can tell by the flat cable). So your mate's TV blowing up in my opinion is a coincidence. Sockets in all of Europe do have earth sockets, but it may not be obvious to travellers because they mostly use the ""Europlug"" standard:   -- a plug that fits in all European sockets (except UK/Ireland without being forced). For your information, there's two main types of sockets in Europe; the French and then the German.

As I'm with Aldi Mobile (PAYG), using Sunrise network, it must either be a Skype issue (probable), or possibly a PAYG issue (unlikely).

I believe you will find that the 2 year Apple warranty only applies to extended guarantees, which you purchase when buying the product, even in CH.     
But Apple actually has great repair/replacement schemes that don't cost the earth.  It's also worth checking out if this was a known defect in the product - then they will replace it for free.   
But again, just going by experience - the Apple Store are usually good in helping find the best solution.

			This morning I got an email from Livestream, stating that their customer account database may have had an unauthorised access, and recommended that users reset their password and included a nice little red link button to do so.   
I didn't even recall having signed up for Livestream (I certainly don't use them), but in a password app. I have indeed recorded log in details, signing up using my FB account.   
I have now changed my password, as a precaution - but not using the email link, but direct from their site, which I accessed independently, plus my FB password.   
I'm erring on the side of caution. and suspecting a possible scam, but just curious as to whether there are any other Livestream account holders, who may have received a similar email?   
It's (hopefully) no big deal as I've never used Livestream or given any personal details, and likewise am not a real FB user.

			Wow Salt really knows how to ring in the new years, by cancelling anything worth having them for.. ITs a bit shit for them to jack up the prices by so much  
and not offer that great a value. some of their data only tariffs are still 30 day contracts .. ok value, but the rest, well not really. best luck, cancel leave.    
lycamobile is going 5gb for 19,99f a month stupid cheap and it was 24.95 4 months ago.. so by summer 2016 i expect 5gb of data to cost 14.99...  
only swisscom and salt dont get it. price wise..

2. waited 5 days 
3. activated my vdsl2 line 50000/10000 for 64f a month.

Email support is quite quick, and it was a cake walk to order.

			I get that benefit too and don't have the roaming bundle..    
The only thing i buy from Lyca is data bundles, usually 5gb per month.. When I cross the border I get an SMS to tell me that my ""FEEL LIKE HOME"" service is now active and I can make and receive calls just like I'm in Switzerland.  
I get a local number and even though ""data roaming"" is disabled in my iPhone settings, I get 3g data for free on the local number.   
It really is a total *bargain, a 100chf top up lasts me for best part of a year and it's effectively swisscom.

			I use Google Voice --    You would need to use a US VPN or proxy to initialize it, as the option to sign up only shows up when you are using an American IP address.  You can then call out or receive incoming calls via Google Hangouts, or use a VOIP adapter like ObiTalk:    I also use LocalPhone,   -- where I have Swiss and US DIDs, and their rates are very competitive. I have travelled the world, and have my DIDs forward to my local mobile.  E.g. the charge to forward/call to Swiss mobile is 11.9¢ (US cents).   Also for a VoIP client, I would highly recommend Zoiper,    I also have Asterisk and FreeSwitch servers on Amazon cloud,  so I can have an IVR, and use FlowRoute and VoIP.ms for my SIP trunks.   
Also, CallCentric offers free NY DIDs   - Just sign up with a non-US address, 
so you would not be subject to E911 fees.

There are many apps to display slideshows but they either just play pics (typical gallery apps) or just play videos (media player apps). Of course 1 solution is a to create a slideshow video of all the pics, so that now I only have videos, and use a media player to loops these videos, but that's not so flexible.

 It reminds me of going through the radio times with my gran who was housebound for most of my childhood and who died when I was 11. 
The Christmas radio times would arrive and we would go through it together and she would mark the things she wanted (and didn't) want to watch at the times she was at home alone over the Christmas period. 
It was in the days before video recorders etc so if you didn't watch it when it was on you didn't see it and she always complained about them messing about with her regular programmes at Christmas.   
So for me it's a childhood memory that I still like to do today as it reminds me of her and an online version wouldn't be the same. We rarely actually watch the things we've highlighted but that's not the point for me, it's the act if doing it that's important.   
So yes in response to Carlos R it is still one of the best bits of Christmas for me even now and it brings a tear to my eye just thinking if it.

- I had the same problem with Orange, cutting me off   sending an extra month bill  
- Sunrise billed me on the wrong contract type, despite their online system showing the correct one  
- Swisscom didn't release my number, and sent me a letter saying I hadn't notified them in time - with a copy of my correctly dated letter, with their arrival stamp also showing it   in time  
- Cablecom never reply to any support issues in less than a week, and messed up our address move, but on the whole have been ok-ish   
So scores - Orange -3  Swisscom -2  Sunrise -1  Cablecom 0   
Dumb or dumber really.

			Hello.  I have just switched from a prepay with Lebara (uses Sunrise) to a subscription with Salt.     
I was really eager to get away from my prepay with Lebara after multiple problems, and found a great deal with Salt, but now that I have switched I have even worse coverage with Salt than with Sunrise.  At my places of work, home, and in St. Gallen I had 4G and at least 4 bars with Sunrise.  Now with Salt I have only 3G and at most 3 bars, although their map claims 4G coverage in all my areas.   
I am curious for those living/frequenting Ostschweiz (SG/TG), which mobile provider you use?  Have you had any problems with coverage?

			Hello, I'd like to change my current smartphone for an LG G4. I have seen several of them on eBay selling for way less than here in Switzerland, so I thought about trying to buy it from the USA and using it here. 
The smartphone is activated under the Verizon network. I am pretty sure that I need to unlock the device for it to work on any GSM network, to do that there are websites that sell unlock codes specifically for this reason. 
Has anyone tried buying a smartphone from the USA and using it here under any of the major network carriers?

you need to transfer your number from another operator 
you just get the SIM card 
you have to accept to pay by direct debit.

			I ordered a new battery for my iPhone 4s on-line from   for CHF25.90.   
They appears to be a Swiss outfit with a .ch domain and prices in CHF, but they are international and the battery was shipped from ""Asia"". Delivery was by post 10 days after ordering.    
The battery came with tools but no instructions. However, there are some on YouTube. It is fiddly to replace and I needed a magnifying glass to see what I was doing. It took me 45 minutes to get the old out and the new one in.   
It works. Any warranty is invalidated, but at 4 years old, there isn't one...

			I had/have one. Not sure if it was the first version or a 2. It's a decent device and I liked using it.   
The downside is the 4GB of internal storage, which is not very much. Being able to add an SD card helped for pictures, but some apps can only be stored on the phone so it filled up pretty fast. Eventually I could no longer update anything despite clearing app caches etc. I gave up on it after about six or eight months.

			Another option for those with time, you can get those adapters from aliexpress for a fraction of the price in Switzerland, they are a 2 in one universal adapters for the Swiss sockets, I ordered some of those a while ago, arrived in about 3 weeks, were all fully working and tax (under 68CHF) and shipping free.      for a single item. For 2.99USD      for a lot of 5 items. For 11.20USD      for a lot of 5. For 10.30USD   
NOTE: there is a colour option of white or black.

			Hi TiMow,   
I've set up a little home cinema in a 5x3 meters room using the   short-distance projector.    
Based on what you write, I think it would also be a great fit for you. It's FullHD and it throws a 2 meters wide image from 1 meter distance (see attachment).   
No matter what people say about the optimum viewing distance/screen size ratio, I totally enjoy the big, high-quality display even from 3 meters distance. And of course, high resolution rocks! I wouldn't go for less than 1080p if you'd like to have a halfway decent home theater.   
I also appreciate that the GT1080 has 2800 ANSI lumens, two HDMI ports (one of them is MHL-capable for smartphone connectivity) and quite a long lamp life of ~6000 hours.    
The noise level is quite low (26dB in Eco mode). And since the projector is close to the opposite wall and NOT above my head, it's even more silent than using a long-throw setup.    
The integrated speaker is alright, but I'm using a Teufel sound system instead.   
Currently, you can get the projector for Back then, I ordered it from Amazon and picked it up at the border to save the German VAT.    "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Dec 2010	Groaned at 292 Times in 196 Posts	I'm completely in the dark - beamer advice required	TiMow	Posts: 9,310

			The best coverage is probably Swisscom. Both Sunrise and Salt have areas where the service is a bit patchy. Sunrise reception is rubbish out towards the Marin direction whereas Salt s really strong. Both Sunrise and salt are weak in the Cortaillod/Boudry area with Salt being slightly better than Sunrise.   
In Neuchâtel itself the the immediate surroundings all three carriers have strong signals although I found Salt to be better than Sunrise overall. I'm happy with the Salt package I have and was very unimpressed by Sunrise ( due to lack of coverage where I live) but others may have different opinions.   
The budget options (COOP, Migros, Aldi, yallo etc) all use one if those three networks so make sure you check which one they use before signing up to them.

My source for battery purchase is   (which gives you nice implicit filtering for delivery from, e.g., the UK or Germany to Switzerland).   
As it happens, I bought an additional battery for a Galaxy Note 3 many months ago from France - reportedly genuine, priced OEM. That battery still performs however genuine it might be.   
If you purchase from Amazon directly (i.e. not market place) you should be pretty safe when it comes to counterfeit product (in case you care).   
Just go hunting for a seller who seems to be trading _a lot_ of batteries, with a very good reputation, and do not go for dirt-dirt-cheap.   
Something around CHF 15 delivered should get you a decent enough OEM battery.

- You could watch it online (with applicable registrations/subscriptions).

			My (very) limited experience of TV web browsers is that they're painfully slow and clumsy to use ...... always having to move a curser on an on-screen keyboard.   
The best option is to use a tablet or smart phone with a Chromecast or Miracast/WiDi dongle.     
Unfortunately, my Samsung 'D' series has picture issues and is currently sitting in the cellar waiting for me to remove the back and have a tinker, but I used both Chromecast and Microsoft Wireless Display adapters with it.   
On my replacement (non-Samsung) TV, I can mirror the screen of an Android tablet using the cast option from settings drop done (only visible when Chromecast is present); or directly to WiDi (wireless display) with Windows phone.          The Smart Hub browser app. was primarily for searching and watching videos, and has now been superseded by the use of casting dongles.

			I came to this thread as I got another mail from UPC-Cablecom with notification that they are going to increase my bandwidth from 125 to 250 Mbit and therefore increase my monthly abo for another 4CHF.   
4chf sound not that much, but this is not the first time they behave like this. And basically, I believe I don't need more than 20-30 Mbit/s and for sure 250 Mbit/s is way too much for me. Internet speed test on my laptop via wi-fi shows that I use only 6-20 Mbit/s.   
At next step I discovered that cablecom charges monthly additionally 30 chf (in 2016 it will be 34 chf   ) for using their 3-in-1 socket. This price is hidden in the Nebenkosten ( ).   
Good news is that in my area since some months fiberglass connection is available. But I definitely have no any other socket (should it be OTO?) except cablecom's one in my apartment.   
Can somebody share his/her experience with switching from cablecom to fibre provider? Do they use cablecom's socket? Do they install a new socket in apartment? What are the costs/procedure to do it if so? Did you succeed to cancel charges for the cablecom's 3-in-one socket ( ) ?

			I am pretty much a novice when it comes to tv technology. I have a VERY slow internet connection with Swisscom (circa 2.5-3.5 mbps) and as a result, I am unable to get cable tv through them. Cablecom is not an option for the building where I live (long story) which is a shame as it would fix my desire for cable tv.   
I will hopefully be replacing my slow internet connection with a 4G connection from Salt via a wifi hotspot.   
I'd love to be able to access to more tv shows and movies as I only have 8 channels or so at the moment. I don't have a smart tv, though it looks to be a version before smart tv technology.   
So, what sort of tv could I access through a 4G connection? I presume normal cable is not an option. Something like Apple TV only?   
Any suggestions would be very much welcome. TY!

			I have multiple Apple IDs for when I need to get apps only available in certain countries.  I stick with my UK one but once a month or so I use iTunes, click ""Account Info"" and then simply log in to one of my other accounts.  I click ""check for updates"", update any apps that need updating, then move on to the next one.   
A sync with the phone or ipad and it's all done; you don't need to switch Apple IDs on the phone or ipad itself (unless that's the device you have with you when you want to grab an app from some other country).

			Hello,   
I just updated my Swsscom iPhone6 to carrier settings 22.2 and I almost fell the phone cool down.   
Before the update, the phone would be almost too hot to touch as I was listening to Apple Music via wifi. Plugged-in, the phone was barely able to maintain it's charge.   
Now it's back up to 100%, still listening to Apple Music, and the phone is cool to the touch.   
Hope this helps,

Use a free proxy app to access all Netflix sites (Hola - brilliant), especially for accessing the U.K. Netflix, but all others as well.  Use media Hint (need to subscribe) for this on mobile devices.   
My experience of Netflix is that they are usually a season behind what is available for streaming on the web for U.S. series.  I usually get these over primewire.ag - also brilliant.

Most modern DVB-C with USB connection will give you the option of recording onto an external drive (USB Stick or Hard drive) some have a better interface/software then others and some are more reliable then others.

			Good afternoon all. I can see you guys know your stuff and decided to ask this here.   
I use 1and1 since 2006 here in the UK. 
I use their templates for my 2 websites. Easy SEO setup (after reading about it for few days) Google ranking is good and I no longer use addwords. Getting enough free enquiries now days.   
I cannot find 1and1 in Switzerland, I'm I wrong?    
Do you recommend that I just pay for my package with 1and1 here in the UK and have the website in Switzerland? Or do you think is better if I get a contract with a Swiss company?   
Can you please recommend me similar company like 1and1 based in Switzerland where I can use their own web templates and create the website on my own.   
Thank you all in advance.

This is unfortunately one of the things I try to get done in Estonia. You could try to get somebody from to ship it to you (since its so thin, less than 2cm, it will go through as a letter) and the total cost would be less than the cheapest iD card in digitec. I am even not sure whether digitecs card reader support the estonian ID cards.

			Hi,   
We too are looking into TV, Wifi, Telephone packages.   Has anyone subscribed to this service more recently.  I see it advertised all over the roads of Zurich, but no one really ever mentions it in conversations as most are with UPC cable and Swisscom.   
Thanks in advance

			Hi,   
bought the Google Chromecast audio dongle today for 39 - 6 tax back and I am really pleased with it.   
Just a few tips: The only audio cable it will only be useful if you have a hifi with an aux connection that expects one 3.5mm input otherwise you will need to an RCA Audio jack to split it into two cables.   
There is a setting in the Chromecast app for HDR (high dynamic range) which by default is switched off but if you are using a decent audio system system you will want to switch it on...their warning for this setting is:   
Note:  Many common speaker systems such as desktop computer speakers, docking speakers, portable and Bluetooth speakers are not built to support such a high dynamic range, causing the volume level to be very loud and sound to be somewhat distorted. Please avoid turning this setting on in those cases.   
If you want to the digital signal directly then you will probably need a mini TOS to standard TOS connection as it uses the same socket as the standard audio cable.    
Playing Google Music and Pandora using the digital connection to a Sony Soundbar it was really impressive and not compressed as sadly a lot of MP3 music sounds.   
I also cast the audio directly from phone to see how well it would work with Tidal. Not as good as with Google Music but still really good.   
One tip don't forget to switch off casting from the app when you are finished otherwise even if the amplifier is switched the device will continue to stream music. I noticed this when I switched everything off...went out came back switched the amp back on and it immediately played music from Pandora even though the amp had been switched off and my phone had been with me.     
Very pleased with my purchase.   
Have fun   
Martin

Anyway, between the last post and now I have sent 4 short emails in English or in Italian using different email addresses and different names, all much the same in content. I explained briefly a (my) situation, where the TV (set) is only used for DVDs and can't be used to capture broadcasts/transmissions of any kind, underlining that the cable socket is sealed.  
I didn't get a single reply, and the last email was sent 2 weeks ago. So they are obviously either not interested in taking on new 'customers' at this stage in view of the upcoming changes in a couple of years' time, or clarifying any queries that the website does not explain properly. You can't say I didn't try!

the other thing that might be stopping you is that you need a German billing address, a bank account and a credit history before they'll give you a subscription. Also, I doubt they'll simply accept that you spend your entire data allowance in Switzerland.

			I don't host with them but have some .ch domains registered with them, I will change that at the next renewal. We had a few problems with email and getting the website online they were slow and not that helpful. We host with A Small Orange which is excellent and their online help is great, they solved the problem we had with Switchplus. Maybe others with good german might have had more luck but 24hrs is too slow a response time when a website has crashed.

			I should also mention (having been informed by my daughter!) that since the installation of our new digi box this morning, we have a better TV picture/reception due to an increase in the number of pixels, which gives the impression that the screen is larger.     
So to recap, by paying CHF 19 extra a month for our Swisscom package, we have unlimited calls to fixed and mobile telephones in Switzerland at no extra cost, calls to Europe, Canada and US for a maximum of 8 hours a month at no extra cost, Internet speed increased from 1gb to 10gb and access to numerous national and international TV channels with enhanced reception.   
I live just two minutes away from Commugny by the way and, no, I am not in any way ""plugging"" Swisscom, just telling things as they are.

Unfotunately, this next move was a bit unexpected, else I would not have make such an big purchase right before the move.  Looking at the responses from the awesome folks on this forum as well as Google, it seems like there is a lot of different variables to consider beyond voltage.  And maybe you are right, selling might be smarter.

			You know now when you have smartfones it's no longer so straightforward to troubleshoot your issue.    
I would say that Sunrise has modest network than every one else (in terms of equipment).    
Of course like someone said before it all depend on your location etc. but also handset itself is causing most issues.    
I would really encourage you to work with someone from Sunrise to state you where's the issue is. For e.g. I'm theirs client since 5 years and I cannot say a bad thing (well maybe 3g in Zurich HB) is an issue.

I have UPC service at home but their customer service left a very bad taste and for what it's worth I would not consider them for anything else for one moment. I do have an M-Budget Mobile One SIM only subscription that was mentioned earlier in the thread, for CHF 29 giving 1GB data plus 500 minutes across Switzerland and fixed lines in a surprising number of other countries. Probably only useful if you are a low user, so if you can set my prejudice aside then UPC might indeed suit you.

If its just the outer cover glass that has been damaged then this is how much it costs. If the entire screen + digitiser is cracked then you'll need a new screen. No point trying to do the job yourself because it involves removing all the cracked shards of glass using a heat gun and then rebonding a new pane of glass which is a messy job, and unless you know what you're doing you'll probably balls it up (e.g. dust or bubbles)

			Hello,   
I just moved to Zurich last weekend I'm trying to get internet at home.    
Unfortunately I can't get a ""predecessor number"" from my landlord, so Sunrise has to send an electrician (for extra 150chf) to do something in the telephone box of the building. I guess this box is the one marked with t+t that I can find in the ground floor. Is it correct?    
However this box is closed. Does this electrician have a special key to open it or should I ask someone (landlord?) the key?

			this should cost 3rp / minute.  Didn't try, since I don't have M-budget.   
But how can you get cheap EU roaming that way?   You'd still need a number for destination country, right?   And the call divert should be going to the destination country's number?

Whether you have good enough coverage with a provider largely depends on where you live and work. I never had decent Swisscom reception at work in Basel, but most people will. Where I live, I can't get a dependable 4G signal (it's pretty much EDGE-only here) from any of the networks, so there's no point In fretting. I will just switch to the cheapest one once my contract is up in November.

I now have a Galaxy S5 DUOS (G900FD)  bought on eglobalcentral since March this year; Work well easy to switch between SIM.     
If you are interested in the premium segment; eglobalcentral has the S6 in dual-SIM also.     
PM me if you are interested in the S4 mini. I still have it lying around.

			Hello,    
We went with Swisscom, which had a few options for making calls to the U.S. included in the package, one was unlimited and the other offered 2 hours/month.   
If you want U.S. television and access to U.S. Netflix, you can go for a VPN subscription, which gives you access to a U.S. IP connection.   
With Skype, if your kids know how to use, the calls are free between skype accounts. If you want to call the landline at home, you can get Skype minutes and place calls from Skype, using your phone, tablet, or PC.  You can also get a Skype phone number using your family's local area code.  With this, your family can call on your Skype line with no long distance charge.  You pay a monthly subscription for this and can hold or cancel it anytime.   
Cheers!

			I've read that the iPhone 6 (and probably the 6 Plus, too) has the overall best camera. 
It's not the best in any discipline, but neither has it got any ""weak"" spots.         
It's not waterproof.  
I guess that's reserved for some future incarnation of it.   
There will quite likely be a new one announced September 9th.

			I started with a Lycamobile sim card as a stop gap, but may actually stick with them instead of an Abo. They use the Swisscom network, so coverage is good and prices are low for my usage (mostly data).    
You can pick and choose what you want: standard rates to France are from 1 rp to 29 rp per minute with a 29 rp connection charge (calls also don't drop randomly to boost the connection charge, which is nice)

			Have a look at Coop Mobile. Their prepaid (Pay as you go) SIM card costs CHF 15.- (sometimes they sell them even for 5.-) including CHF 15.- credit, and in the first month after activation, you have 500 MB for free. 
After that, they have packages: CHF 9.90 for 500 MB, CHF 24.90 for 1.5 GB. 
Plus you can call all Coop Mobile and Salt (ex-Orange) mobile phones for free (up to 3000 minutes per month).     
Lebara also have several data plans:   
Their SIM card is available for free, with no credit, and you must then top it up (Guthaben kaufen).

			Hello I had this same issue for 18 months, now I have sat down to fix it.    
I have a Centro Piccolo, and I am not sure I have VDSL, but still this might be helpful.   
I have been able to obtain some success, which means I have browsed my USB external drive attached to my TimeCapsule connecting to it by the cellular connection of my iPhone (although I was sitting at home next to the TimeCapsule)   
The key setting, I believe, is to activate IP Passthrough in the Swisscom modem/router and select the TimeCapsule as the ""computer"" in the network which will receive all the traffic.   
I will test it better tomorrow from work, but the test from cellular should be unmistakable.    
Cheers

			Hi all,   
I'm looking for some technical advice please on ""Digi-box"" empfang box /HDD recorders to replace my current version that's given up the ghost.   
I have WWZ as my internet and TV broadcast supplier and when I joined their ranks I was given a receiver and credit card sized card with chip. The receiver was pretty basic, offering nothing more than just the channel and what was currently being shown. Not long after, I went back to ask for a receiver that offered recording facilities as well. I was offered their only option which was a Kaon ""something or other"", and although they only had second hand units (returned rental stock), it did offer a pretty large internal hard drive and the ability to record 2 different programmes whilst watching a 3rd channel. As it was used, I was only charged CHF99, which has served me well. That unit has now packed in and died and would like to replace it.   
Yesterday, I called into WWZ to ask if they had another, but was told they had no more, but I could rent one (different brand) within my agreement for another CHF26.50/month or I could buy a smaller receiver and simply connect an external hard drive to it for just CHF99. Got it home, got it all set up, external drive works, but as I didn't think to ask, I discovered I can only record 1 channel and whilst doing so, cannot watch anything else. Therefore, I want to get something much more suitable for my needs/wants.   
I'll be straight up and honest and say I'm not a complete technophobe, but A/V kit, I'm lost in this kind of tech area.   
My first question is, do I have to use the specific receiver that's offered by WWZ, or can I use a generic version? 
If I can use A.N. Other brand not specific to WWZ, any ideas what I could look at as alternatives? I know what I want, but not sure I know what I need. I want a receiver that allows me to record multiple (or at least one) channel/s whilst watching another, an internal HDD would be ok, but not essential if there is an output to connect an external HDD to, and has the card slot to connect the receiver with my card/WWZ account and that's about it.   
Any thoughts, advice gratefully received.   
Many thanks.

			I don't have the similar router to sort out the exact issue. But once you set up a port forward it should work. Make sure things are set up right, with your firewall and local apache/any-other server. Assuming you already sorted out setting up 'DNS hostname and a Static IP(local) for for your machine, it should work.

			I went through to download the app via the website and there was just a blank screen and via the App Store when I searched ""Zattoo"" nothing appeared. However I just went to take screenshots to attach to this reply and for the first time (after several goes) a message appeared saying it's only available in the Swiss store. So I think it's definitely because my iTunes/App Store is UK not Swiss. I'll now need to look to switch it.    
Not sure about the VPN and IP Q....I use Swisscom Internet, it's an iPad purchased in the UK but I'm using it in Switzerland. Might I encounter further problems if I do manage to download the Zattoo app (through switching my App Store / iTunes to Swiss)?   
Thanks for your help

			I posted a while back, because I wanted to set up and home network with UK VPN available selectively across the home network.  I thought I would share my solution since it required a lot of interweb trawling and fiddling around.  UPC Cablecom is the provider.   
1. Update UPC Modem to Technicolor model, as this is the only one to support bridge mode 
2. ASUS DD-WRT capable modem, in my case AC68U, install ASUSWRT-Merlin firmware 
3. Set up the router VPN client with the OpenVPN configuration from your VPN provider, Im using ExpressVPN 
3. Decide what devices you want to have permanently on the VPN, assign static IPs to those devices, for example Roku media server running iPlayer 
4. Set the Redirect Internet Traffic to Policy Rules and add those IPs as Source IPs designated to go via the VPN 
5. Set up VPN Client software on devices such as PC's and iPads that you want to be able to use VPN selectively with.   
Simples.   
Im sure there are slicker setups involving more tinkering for those who are really happy with advanced network routing settings and DDWRT scripting, but this provides a stable setup using just the GUI's, a very simple firmware update, and setting up a few devices with static IPs.   
I switched from StrongVPN to ExpressVPN, because the PC and iOS clients are much slicker, allowing for quick changes eg between UK and US servers.   
Hope this helps.

			So the new Net+ settop box has been launched, I've been a betatester for it since beginning of June. If you have the TV+ box you'll be receiving in your postbox the new device by the end of the month.    
It's miles better on speed & ease of use, but replay is a lot more limited than the previous system. Apparently more channels are recordable though,  so that might compensate. Additionally dual audio channels (bicanal) works on all channels, so films on Les Plus for example are now all in English if originally filmed in English. Pricing is pretty decent too, and all the usual UK channels are available bar E4 which is in a ""English pack"" which is pretty rubbish.

Actually Lycamobile already does this...they have several options that include free roaming. One of their plans charges 12 CHF for 200 minutes + 200 SMS to any number in Switzerland and the EU. However when roaming in certain european countries (UK, Germany, Italy...etc) you can call for free using just your alloted 200 minutes. Strangely enough they even let you roam in the USA.

			Hi friends,   
I am going to start a new website and it will contains entertainment content. I have been looking for the best ASP.NET hosting provider which cheap price.   
Below are the requirements that I've been researching: 
1. Want to host multiple sites 
2. I want a web hosting provider which located their data center in europe, Swiss or France servers are preferred (this because of speed) 
3. Latest ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC Versions 
4. Latest SQL database  
5. 24/7 online support 
6. My budget is about 5.00  
7. It should not create any problem when i run the scripts   
After i've reading some review, my concern now is  , i think they are fit with my needs. Also they have european based hosting service. Is there any of you who ever had an experience with them? Are they really trusted? you can share your experience here. Or if you have another recommendation, please let me know.    
Actually, I am a beginner to this. I want to know, are there any more things do i need to look before I buy the hosting plan. And also are there any hidden charge will be there in hosting plans normally? Please suggest me.

			I think the only option you have to record is by connecting the video to the TV using the coaxial cable, but would only be able to record what was currently on the TV screen.    
Do you have coaxial cable wall sockets? If yes, it may be worth connecting a coaxial cable between that and the video recorder. 
If you're in an apartment, basic cable may be available as part of your rent/costs ....... but you've probably already checked all this.

			Do you know the person, or just the IP. Your initial statement was vague. Also, is the IP in Switzerland?   
With regards to ongoing security, do you have any idea how they got your password? If they got it by, say, hacking your computer, then you need to clean that up before trusting the computer again. By ""clean that up"" I mean to reformat and reinstall everything.   
Fortunately, the most common way for a gmail account to be ""hacked"" is when somebody uses the same password for both gmail and some other website. Then the other website is hacked and all the passwords stolen. So, if you did reuse your password, you probably don't need to clean up your computer, but you do need to change the password everywhere it was used, preferably without re-use.   
You also should at least check the password of any website accounts which know about the gmail address - if access to gmail let them reset passwords, they might have done so and deleted the resulting email chain.   
P.S. In addition to not re-using passwords, you can turn on   for the account. This is slightly less convenient and you have to be careful not to lock yourself out if you lose your phone (I keep a printout of recovery codes locked up somewhere safe.), but it makes your account quite a bit safer.

			Hi,   
Windows 8 was not bad it was just that they focussed so heavily on the tablet and touch screen users that some of the default settings made it more difficult to use than it should have been. The learning curve was not large 8 and you just need to make a couple of small changes to the default settings and it worked well on a non touch laptop. They polished it with Windows 8.1 and 10 improves again on 8.1 and if you now longer have the feeling that the desktop is second best. The who start menu discussion was pretty idiotic, search and pin for commonly used programmes...simple stuff.   
So you are not the only person. 
Have fun

			AFAIK, SIM cards from Lebara and Lycamobile can be bought from Kiosks (which should be at the airport - but can't confirm).   
But you will need ID and probably, some official CH resident status documentation.   
Unfortunately, it's not like Jason Bourne buying an all-in phone and SIM package at Waterloo Stn.

Plus the battery is also exchangeable (no idea about the Huawei).     
I don't recall that Cath is a mountain biker (therefore not needing trail maps) so I would imagine Google Maps or Nokia Here maps would give sufficient on and off-line coverege to meet her needs.     
Honestly for a technically undemanding person there's no reason a smartphone shouldn't last as long as a dedicated GPS.  UNLESS waterproofing is essential....(even then there are posssibilities)

Well, this was the case. 
Until now, I only used the mother board DVI plug. Until it didn't work anymore - after I unplugged my ""current"" BenQ monitor and plugged the Samsung T260HD monitor.   
After unplugging the ""new"" monitor and re-plugging the BEnQ monitor, it still didn't work.   
It is only after plugging the BEnQ in the video card and it worked, that I figured out that the on-board plug/s was the problem.

			My wife has a Swisscom abo and a Sony Z3 mobile phone.   
When somebody sends her an MMS it arrives OK but often she gets the same MMS on the next day at the same time.  In the worst case this continued every day for three weeks, we even visited the friend who had sent this one and deleted it from their phone but my wife continued to get copies.   
Anybody have a clue what could cause this?

			Yep .... I have a couple of fully enclosing cases, for better protection - but always revert back to the magnetic smart cover (which only covers the screen on a mini), because it just makes it that little bit more pocketable (lighter and less bulky).   
I always charge mine everyday (overnight), as I use it a fair amount. Certainly don't get 10 hours, but I could probably tweek a few settings for better battery life.

			Hello and Thank you for your rely.   
The problem was that in the first, second and ect. invoice there is no telethon number or email or address to which to ask for cancelation. 
Also no web site. in the last reminder letter I saw email and I ask for cancelation and got the reply with the text I attached. 
When I clicked on the advertisement at the beginning I did not go to the whole process and I also wrote my address wrong by mistake and cancel the order. When I received the packages with the wrong address I see that the post tried to sent back to them but also I see their address cross and my address as sender as well. What is the meaning of this? 
If I did not confirm the order why they send me package, invoice and even recurrent subscription.  
They are laying and cheating.  
I don't have possibility to see what they have about me in their database or the order they said I have done. 
Be careful and this is my warning to all of you. 
See on this link what happened to other people in other countries.

I guess M9 would be even better.   
I also have a Sony tablet, so I can see why you would want the Z4, design is a bit nicer & the UI is very smooth.

			Mobile phone roaming agreements are very much different from content right management issues. It would need bilateral treaties for Switzerland to participate in such an open-trade environment. And we all know that these are not going to happen - so it's almost certain that Switzerland will be left out of this for the foreseeable future and that instead we'll be paying through the nose for content in the future as open access in the EU will likely reduce margins - Switzerland will be an easy target for getting some of that money back.

Thanks for answer. Actually with standard Satellite dishes we can access to FTA broadcasts here. According to your answer this is legal. Only one think is HD streams. these types streams also FTA and anyone can watch these with standart satellite dishes in my country but these HD's outer my country can't watch.    
without HD streams this type of business a bit meanless from my side. Because many people has got big screens and SD channels looks really bad. Is there web page to check Swiss re-broadcasting rules?

Does anyone here have experience with green.ch as an internet provider?  They  have fibre-optic service, which my new apartment is wired for, for a lot less than what SwissCom will provide.  They also seem to have some good ratings on the internet.

I can confirm from personal experience that all three major networks cock up any sort of transfer, and inevitably blame the other side.   
I've also done prepay to contract - even within Orange it was a spectacular fail (the number ended up in some sort of limbo where the prepay SIM worked, but accounts thought the number was still contract and thus I couldn't load money onto it). But at least I didn't lose the number and could receive calls.

There are a lot of things you can do to enhance old pictures but it is always a case of diminishing returns and unless you can spend oodles of time to reconstruct the photo completely from scratch you are not going to have a lot of luck.  
Can you scan an example perhaps?

			Hi guys, can only talk to my experiences.   
No port blocking, restriction of VoIP services when using either of the carriers mentioned (prepay services) (since March)   
For example, FaceTime, Skype, Google Hangouts all work fine on mobile data out and about, to such a point where I commit all my credit towards data, I don't make any phone calls/txt's of any kind - my phone calls are done entirely through the use of these apps.    
Agree that the device needs to be unlocked etc, a purchase outright of any phone should come that way anyway (provided you don't purchase through a carrier).    
Suprisingly using data for calls is quite affordable. A regular 5min call is a fraction of a cost through a Voip service compared with call rates and uses 5-10MB which is minimal. A 15CHF 1gb plan is lasting me about a month if frugal, (no hotspot and using wifi at all opportunities) so it's doable.    
Perhaps Sunrise and Salt will introduce restrictions to how data is used but at least this way they are driving up the use of data services. I also believe data restrictions on VoIP and charging for hotspots is a bit yesteryear, certainly in Australia anyway where this was the norm a few years ago.  Competitive carriers with introduction of 4g have removed all that nonsense and we've been free to use data however for a little while now.

And that's the second time this week that I saw a warning about counterfeits of a brand-name product. Don't tell me that faking is now spreading beyond dodgy Rolex watches and designer handbags - too many 3D printers out there.

			Update....   
The blu-ray DVDs (Justified Season 4 and 5) arrived and I could NOT watch them on my blu-ray player. Error message said ""wrong region"". Another blu-ray DVD bought at the same time for which Amazon also said ""Region A/1"" was in fact multi region. Conclusion: Region-specification on Amazon IS unreliable. AND: I was now sufficiently motivated to get me a A/1 player.   
So I started evaluating A/1 blu-ray players and voltage converters. After looking at various on-line shops I limited evaluation to Amazon, compared reviews, prices, (shipping) weights and shipping costs and finally went for:   
and   (the cheaper and lighter Simran-voltage converter suggested by monkeyboy76 was not an option as the seller did not offer international shipment - same as some other sellers)   
The whole lot cost me CHF 99 (player) + 30 (converter) + 32 (shipping) + 14 (""import fees deposit"") = 175. But from experience I expected to be charged with some more cost when it arrives (taxes, VAT and whatever). But that didn't happen - the lot arrived yesterday, no further cost! Amazing...    
AND IT WORKS by the way...    
Thanks again for the helpful tips regarding voltage converter - that saved me a lot of time  "	earned some respect	Join Date: Jun 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	blu ray player for region A1	jogpsa	Posts: 99

			I have a similar setup as Phil_MCR (and probably a few million others)   
RPi (not the 2, the first B+, no idea of the name) with XBMC, plus Transmision, Couchpotato and Sickrage. I have not big problems playing movies (no idea whether they are 4K, but some files are around 4Gb if that helps).   
I am using XBIAN in Raspberry. And I would say that running the whole setup (Transmission/Couchpotato/Sickrage/XBMC) is pushing a tiny bit the limits. So, although it works and do the job, I am not surprise that for me, managing those apps through web interface is a tad slow and there are few glitches here and there (for that I have a few scripts to restart, email and a monitor the system)   
I am trying now to free the load of the Raspberry and moving most of the apps to the NAS (QNAP) and leaving RPi just as media center (running Xbian XBMC/Kodi).   
Ah, for me I found it impossible to run RPi using WiFi (extremely slow) so I had to connect it to the router.   
I have considered replacing the RPi with CuBox:    
The system is running 24x7, and it gets hot, but is not noisy and I believe one of the advantages is that it does not consume much. One of the disadvantage (if you care) is that you end up having quite a mess of cables around   "	null	null	null	Quiet and compact Media PC - ideas?	guest	null

			I set up an old busted up mac as a server, made an account available with acccess to WebDav, CalDav and CardDav. Used a dynamic DNS to point to my network.   
This can then syncronise all my contacts and calanders across all devices, plus I then use Goodreader to access my files from the WebDav account and from there pass them onto the relevant app.   
It's basically my homebrewed personal cloud, and works from wherever I have internet access.   
Naturally all connections are encrypted.

			Hi everyone, I just joined this forum so I could post to this thread.     
I just arrived in Zurich last Saturday and wanted to get a mobile phone.  Alas, similar to the other in this thread, I don't have my B permit yet.  I went to Orange Citydisc at the airport, and they told me that I can get a prepay phone just using my passport.     
Since the Internet rates are cheaper than the offerings at the store, I decided to go online to order.  However, the online form only has an option for the B permit ID number, and when I tried to enter my passport number, the system rejected it, saying it was in the wrong format.   
Does anyone know how to workaround this?  I guess my only options now are to pay the higher rates in the store, or just wait until I get my B permit.

the below works for an iphone on the O2 network (UK), but i suspect that other networks do similar.   
if you have a locked iphone, it is now possible to get it unlocked so that you can use any SIM. it's free to do if you're on anything apart from a pay as you go tariff (PAYG unlock is 15 quid).   
you just need to go onto the O2 website and register your details to get it unlocked. takes up to 14 days. if you are in the middle of a contract, then you will, of course, still have to honour the remaining payments, but can still get it unlocked.   
once you're unlocked, you're good to go to use a Swiss prepaid SIM.

			Thank you all for all this wonderful information. One thing I didn't mention was that I do not have a Swiss phone number. Today, one thing led to another, and I decided I needed a Swiss simcard in my phone for those times when I'm out and about. So, I read all your advice again - checked out all the suggestions online, along with options for obtaining a Swiss mobile number. I came up with a plan: cheap simcard with Swiss number (M-budget 29 CHF/m) plus Skype subscription and Skype number in Australia.   
Armed with my plan, I went down to the local post office to get my simcard and was totally talked-out-of-it by the lovely lady behind the counter. I walked out with L'Abo simcard for 39 CHF/m, which gives me unlimited calls to mobiles and landlines in Switzerland, Australia and lots of other places, unlimited texts in Switzerland and 1 Gb of data per month.   
I'll let you know how it goes. So far, so good.

			Bump (five months later). And still thinking about it.    
I'd prefer to avoid any providers using Sunrise network, to avoid problems with the number transfer. So no Aldi or yallo.    
I could go with the Post Abo, but that is managed by Orange and its infamous administrative services.   
The leading options now are Lycamobile prepaid, or M-Budget One subscription. Both use Swisscom's network.    
The plan is moving to one of those, staying a couple months, and then moving back to Sunrise.

			Anyone using the above and buying a monthly data package?   
I normally buy 500MB for 9,90, for 30 days, but seldom use it all up. Any volume left over at the end,   carried over on renewal and is lost.   
However, having just renewed (15th), I noticed that 170MB unused was added to the new 500MB - giving available total of 670MB.   
After four days, nothing has changed (other than reduction through usage), so I'm assuming/hoping that this wasn't a one-off error, but a policy change.   
Anyone else, noticed this?     
ETA: the website still writes that any unused data is forfeited at the end of the 30 days, so possibly just an error.

you should contact cablecom again and ask them if the case above is indeed the situation, but your landloard should know as he/she most likely pays that fee or indeed authorised the cable disconnection.   
Note: if the above is the case and your wall connection was simply sealed, you can unseal it and by only paying the 29CHF (if not in your tenet agreement) you actually get free basic  .

			I do generally like lycamobile. But i just don't trust them not to kill off my number unannounced. Their terms and conditions change behind the scenes a lot. Their customer service has been reasonable to me, although they tried to prevent me from moving my number form lyca to new provider. It was only the new provider who yelled at them for them to release the number. lyca was claiming i never authorised the transfer SENT YES to 499.. but I kept the text as proof for new carrier.     
Their bonus money can only be used for calls, really is ok but burns me that it was not shown anywhere on their website. I like the discounts of calls overseas and the great prices for data, but their increase in connection charges 29c and their stupid high prices for making a local calls. Well...   
I like saving money, but their inconsistent service did my head in..  
Still if you want a cheap data only provider and don't give a crap about calling,  
go with lycamobile.. if you can about customer service or if you have any issues in activation or tech issues, just walk away, as i did by moving the number ..   
time to go looking.     
ps: lycamobile seems to have become a little popular due to their cheap prices on data, etc. however their  
customer service has been appalling..

			No, I meant I don't buy that I need to pay for a TV license just because I have an internet connection and there is an offchance that maybe I watch SRF, TSI or RTS over Zattoo or something. Even if I can't understand any of those languages and don't watch those channels.   
If you own a TV or a radio and actively listen to swiss content you should pay for a TV or radio license here no question, but Billag just saying ""oh everyone who has an internet connection should pay up"" is taking the mick in my opinion.

			Thanks everyone. So what I ended up doing was walking to digitec expand buying the adaptor there. Good thing I did in person because, as others mentioned, I was wrong about the sim card slots. My work provided me a ""nano-sim"" (I didn't know that was a thing) and I converted it to a ""microsim."". Turns out a full size sim card is huge!    
Anyway, problem sorted and I now have coverage.  
Thanks everyone again!

			Max Gehrig in Zug, 041 711 22 33, did our telephone connections for both our moves here.   
The first place was extra offices for a business on the first floor and we needed to have our telephone separated from theirs. The second place had ISDN installed and the box was the property of Swisscom, so they took it out when leaving and left all the wires sticking out. The first time was < CHF100, the second time was around CHF 139.   
The same company installed around 5 lights in both places for less than CHF 200.

			My advice is to use VOIP for all calls!   
Even (especially) to Swiss landline and mobile calls. Just worry about the data, and not the international calls. Once you have a data allowance you can use VOIP with a SIP app.   
I use Sunrise Pay-as-you-go but when I last checked, Aldi had a better deal. The Sunrise data performance is good enough to use VOIP most places. 9chf gets 250mb monthly allowance which will do all my calls for a month, still leaving some for checking email in emergencies. A 2GB data topup with Sunrise is 19chf when needed and lasts a month. That combined with hotspot access free from a home ISP (eg Cablecom hotspots in most residential areas), friends WIFI's etc.   
VOIP uses surprisingly little data, but does need low latency and the power of a decent handset made in the last 3 years or so.   
voipcheap.co.uk on my mobile gives me most international landline calls for free (including Switzerland), most mobile calls for 2p per min, eg, UK, Germany. Swiss mobiles are a little more but not much.

			Good evening,   
If you did not make any phone call or chargeable text message from your swiss Lebara line (once within 6 month period) you number will be automatically deactivate from the system.   
Unfortunately Lebara should not be able to reactivate this number but if it still on your balance more than CHF20 (CHF20 is the price for a balance transfer from old expired number to a new Lebara existing number) Lebara can transfer your old balance to a new Lebara number (this new number needs to be registred under the same name than the expired account, I mean yours, if not the transaction will be impossible).   
Ex 1 :  Old expired number 076*****5 with CHF 40 balance left. 
You can take the money back to your new existing Lebara number 076*****6 
at least : CHF20.   
Ex 2 : Old expired number 076*****5 with CHF15 blance left. 
You will lost this money as the balance was under CHF20, so, you cannot cover the fee for the transaction.   
I hope this explaination will help you    
Have a nice evening.

			Amazon.de lets you deposit an estimated fee at checkout and that's final, whether or not Swiss customs examine the package.   
From Amazon.de  , which I studied when DHL screwed up and double charged me after I had paid the Amazon deposit:      When you go without a deposit, things change according to the carrier if your package is not duty-free: 
- Swiss Post will ask you for cash at delivery 
- UPS now asks you for cash at delivery 
- DHL and Fedex bill you separately after delivery (DHL charges Custom expenses plus a 19CHF fixed fee per delivery)   
In my experience (Blu ray boxsets, PS4 games, etc) I was never charged for things costing less than 50 Euros (ordered individually of course), regardless of their provenance (usually UK or DE)

			It seems orange surf unlimited for 35 / month is best currently out there.. 
Unless you need not more than 1GB then: 
1GB - lebara -15chf 
1GB - yallo - 15chf 
1GB - aldi mobile - 15CHF 
1GB - orange - 15 CHF 
1GB - OK mobile - 14CHF 
1GB - sunrise - 15CHF     
So basically 1GB -> 15 chf on pretty much most / all networks... sometimes however networks like lebara have promotions on top-ups meaning that for example for 100chf topup online you'd get 250 credit (that was the case at some stage).   
EDIT: Ah I got a mixed up, lyca seems the way to go they have: 
1GB - 6CHF / month - details here:   also they give you MORE  money they you pay in so effectively package is even cheaper:   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jun 2013	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Zurich: best package for internet usage	gregorr	Posts: 14

			Yes, in the contract it explicitly says Orange ""may charge 300CHF"" if cancelling before the minimum 12 month contract period. I naively assumed that this minimum contract period had passed after the first 12 months.    
I can totally understand firms protecting themselves against people cancelling after very short periods, as the administration costs of setting up a service or contract, then becomes significant.    
For our mobiles, we switching to Mobile One, which looks like a very reasonable alternative.

Maybe they keep stocks of the more popular titles in Germany which could be cheaper.   
For Kindle books I have to buy through amazon.de. I'm presuming there are copyright complications.

- beep every minute or so: you have enabled call counter, which alerts you on the increasing duration of the call (and fees) 
- three short beeps in the beginning of the call: you have enabled function alerting you to outgoing, as in out-of-swisscom-network calls. This is used when you call a 079* number which has been ported to a different carrier and you are alerted to the fact this is no longer swisscom estate.  
- beep resembling ongoing ring signal: attempt to power off phone, take out sim card; if device allows it remove battery, too. If battery is removable, press and hold power button without battery to eliminate any residual charge. If battery is enclosed, wait for a few minutes with SIM out. Insert SIM, insert battery, power on. SIM should initialize a fresh connection, ditto for your device.

			Hi,   
I am about to move into my new place and unfortunately no cable internet nor fiber is available... So DSL is only option... 
I want to spend up to let's say 50 / month... Best value I found is sunrise with 1,5 up / 15Mbit down for 40 chf.. 
But question is, sunrise says this comes with free phone service... does this mean there is no monthly phone line charge?  
Is there any better deal out there? I'm talking about region Zurich...

Also support has been extremely fast in replying (some connection problems on a Friday evening that were actually due to EWB). Moreover, you can try it for one month and if you decide to go for it you don't pay anything for the three subsequent months!   	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Apr 2007	Groaned at 46 Times in 39 Posts	New Apartment, have to choose new provider	StirB	Posts: 1,870

			I can give my two-penneth on TV, internet and mobile packages also:   
Went with Migros Budget Mobile for CHF 29 per month. 500 mins, 500 texts and 1GB of data, which is carried by Swisscom. Ordered online and it came by post (you have to sign for it). So far so good, although you may need a Swiss friend to help you understand the contract options - i.e. new number required vs overtaking old etc.   
Went with Cablecom's ""Horizon Cool Duo"" TV and internet bundle for CHF 85 per month (first 2 months are CHF 69, but there's also a one-time activation fee of CHF 49 applicable). Ordered it over the phone and the plug-in modem came in the post. TV offering includes 135 channels and quite a few English channels. Internet offering includes fast + reliable WiFi throughout my 75sqm apt.

818	null	null	null	null	"    Hey thanks!  We did see this but it didn't make a ton of sense since we don't speak German.  Google Translate turned it into a bit of an omelette.   We printed out the letter from the site you posted, though, and will send it via registered mail with copies of all correspondence from them this week.  We also found some forum online that indicated it isn't uncommon for scammers here to send documents from fake debt agencies, making us doubt whether we have really even been turned in to the ""real"" collections' office.  I guess I was more specifically asking if anyone on EF has personally had to resolve something like this...?      Well this just makes me sad.  Back home, we'd get unsolicited calls for discounts on cruises (that were legitimate) and other travel deals.  My credit card company even gave me an unsolicited ring-a-ding one time to thank me for being such a good customer and lowered my APR.  Is there nobody in Switzerland who shuts down scammers like this?  I refuse to live as a shut-in in fear of answering my own phone.  That being said, I likely would have hung up immediately, but my husband is far more polite than I am.  He treats every caller as if it were his mom on the line.   Besides, if we don't answer the phone, how will we know when we've won the lotto?!        Considering that we're still fairly new to Switzerland, pretty much all calls are from numbers we don't recognize.  When we tried that tactic immediately upon arriving, we missed calls from potential landlords while we were apartment hunting, from the local cantonal office, and from my husband's new employer.  And why folks here don't leave voice mails is beyond me!

			I had a similar problem in my apartment, if I plugged the modem in my living room where the main coax was, it working fine, but if I would move it to another room where there was a slave coax cable, wouldn't work.    
Cablecom sent their technician who measured and noticed that the signal was weak on the second cable, the signal needed amplifier if you wanted to have the modem in the other room. The amplifier could go on top of the building (you will need permission from neighbors etc) or it could go where the main cable is. I decided to place an amplifier on the main cable because it gives me a clean space in my living room (the amplifier is in the wall and is not bigger than the modem). Since than the modem in the second room works no problem. I have a lot of stuff attached on the modem so it's really not possible to have it in the living room. I think the amplifier was around 100 something CHF. You might have the same problem.

			I don't think that anyone would be stupid enough to give you an existing Natel number that even with pay as you go is registered to their name.

			i have all my devices with sunrise, including internet, tv & phone. due to this, and probably also because I'm a customer for quite a while now, one sometimes gets special offers (especially when it comes to expiry of the contract and   ) or they offer coupons on websites e.g. this    . In that sense I really think they give a lot of incentives for the clients, which I haven´t  seen from Cablecom at all. Hence, in the end I believe you can get pretty good value for money from Sunrise.

			First of all I would like to wish Mr Neil luck, well a hell of a lot of it.  He is going to need it and maybe some miracles.     
I don't know if he knows it yet but I believe that he has baught the mobile operator with the worst customer care in Switzerland, or maybe even Europe.     
Why do I say that?  Well from personal experience.     
I have been a customer of Orange UK, O2, BT, Virgin France, Vodafone UK, Vodaphone Ireland, Virgin UK, Swisscom, Sunrise, Cablecom, Green.ch, Lebara UK, Lebara CH, O2 Ireland and a few more.  But I have never felt that Orange CH wanted to keep me as a customer.    
Many people I speak to also say the same.     
In 2014 Orange failed to do the following;   
1 To provide a usable 3G reception in my office in Lausanne.  In fact I regularly received SMS messages welcoming me to France.  They might as well have given my a million minutes, and 20 Terabytes, I could never have used it.     
2 To bill me correctly.     
3 Deliver an iPhone I ordered on their call centre.     
4 To cancel my order so I could pick it up in an Orange shop in Lausanne.   
5 To move my number to another operator in one month (after I gave up on Orange).     
6 To give me credible reasons why number 5 wasn't done.     
7 To give me the customer service manager's name so I could complain directly to them.   
I still am a Swisscom customer.  I have to say their customer care is second to none.  It is easily the best I have ever seen in Europe.  They are professional, punctual, polite, competent and they do what they say they will do.     
They are a little expensive, but which would you rather, an expensive service with unlimited minutes and data that works almost everywhere in Switzerland, and 1st class customer care, ----- or something less.   
Please reply.  It is important that you share your experience as well.

The goverment found that it shouldn't be our job to find out if the site we're downloading from is legal or illegal. It is illegal though to upload. One software I can recommend is   You can download youtube clips to mp3 files. So you won't have the danger of getting any viruses like with the P2P softwares

			There are plenty of IPTV subscriptions available at a cost and most are in HD.   
I subscribe to a service with 60+ sports channels from all the big networks (in The US, Canada, The UK - SKY, Nordics, Ireland etc) so do a google search and be enlightened. I had to by a MAG250 box at a premium, but worth it in the end... (I don't watch sports at all but they are included in the 200+ channel lineup)   
If you are looking for any free services, I would not count on you finding anyone and if you do, the quality may be thereafter...

			I encountered the same problem yesterday when I wanted to re-tune my Humax freesat box after one the LNB came loose, which meant I can't record one programme and watch another unless I re-tune and reinsert the freesat channels again.   
However, the Humax box no longer recognises the UK Postcode I used when I first installed. I even tried the postcode with and without the space in the middle but still no joy. It then dawned on me that maybe the signal strength is low for the re-tune but I checked and its 100% signal and receptions.    
What further puzzled me is that we also have another TV where it's hooked to the same satellite dish and we can see most of the free to air channels except for ITVBe.   
Can anybody ne shed any light why the freesat channels won't re-tune? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, especially from Ace1.

In other words, it doesn't hurt to start low and then increase as necessary.

			Another example of being Switzerlanded?   
Up until the end of the year Swisscom was running an offer giving Deezer Premium plus access for half price. I've actually tried it and it didn't really worked for me. It may have been an issue with me using an account initially set up in UK that kept being reset, yada, yada. I did get some of the money back but wasted plenty of time on customer support   
Now they revised the offer for 12.95/month       
Now considering that Deezer Premium costs 12.95/month on the Deezer website, what sort of offer is that? What is Swisscom offering on top, a pat on the back and their warm appreciation for being a customer? In UK Orange used to offer Deezer bundled with some plans and the (quite sizeable) Deezer downloads were free and not subtracted from the data allowance. This would make quite a difference considering the eye-watering data charges for Swisscom, but funny data usage it's not mentioned anywhere... So I don't really get it, is it just a half-arsed attempt at jumping into the bandwagon or am I missing something?   
OK, time for my pills now. Thanks for listening   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Jan 2014	Groaned at 16 Times in 11 Posts	Deezer on Swisscom	dandi	Posts: 241

			We have Apple Tv in both of our houses in Switzerland and France.  You can rent movies that have just come out on DVD or buy movies that have just come out in the theaters.  Everything's in English.  All of the US TV series are current up to the last season.     
Our regular TV runs off the Slingbox/Slingcatcher system, but this requires that you have a cable TV system somewhere available to you in the US.  This system ""slings"" your cable system from the US directly to your computer or TV over here.  The only problem with this system is that if you watch live TV, you are watching 6 hours behind.  (We never do this:  we tape everything, which is the most important function of this system, in my opinion.)   
So, I have to watch The Walking Dead on Monday morning, instead of Sunday night, but it's really only a slight inconvenience.

			For calls only (no data), look at   (British card).   
You can call Switzerland from the US for 3p/minute.   
Best of all, you will get a Swiss number and a US number, working on one card in parallel. Incoming calls are free, no matter on which number or where you receive the call.   
I usually divert my ""normal"" Swiss number to my toggle-swiss-number, and hence have free incoming calls.

			Cablecom is pathetic. I held onto the receipts for the two boxes I sent back when we moved for ages because they refused to confirm in writing that the boxes were received. The customer service person told me if I sent them using their label there should not be a problem.   
I sent both back using the Cablecom stickers but I did get a post office receipt.   
We cancelled everything when we moved as Cablecom told us that there was no service at our new address. Imagine how surprised we were after clearing up the garden and discovering a Cablecom box on our property with cables running to the house.    
Even when Cablecom sent the final invoices they did not confirm receipt of the box. So go back to Cablecom and tell them that they failed to notify you on the final invoice that the box was not returned and you did not keep the postal slip for months.

			Starting a new thread as the old one's most recent post is 2.5 years old - an eternity in this area - and lots of pages long so I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a thread for current apps   
As part of a comms rationalization and cost-cutting exercise, I'm about to become the owner of a nice shiny iPad Air 2 (yeah, it took me ages to get my head round the idea that a new toy will actually enable me to save around CHF 80 per month with no upfront costs).    
In addition to the basics such as Evernote, Dropbox and the iOS versions of various business tools, I have already thought of MS Office and Noteshelf to acquire. I'd really like some form of calendar app that I can use with handwriting that will automatically turn the writing into text and block off appointments, along with info such as addresses to go to, client's phone no etc (I currently use a Moleskine paper diary because it's simply too much hassle to type it all into online calendars and tab from field to field).    
The range of apps seems to be considerably more mature than when I had my (now defunct) original iPad, so what does the EF collective consider to be must-have or useful things to do with an iPad these days? I'm not interested in games, and I have a separate dedicated eReader.    
Also can anyone recommend a smart pen/stylus? I'm looking at writing notes rather than drawing… (although 53's Pencil looks fun)

Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd support a product purchased in Europe if it has an EU Bloc Warranty. This warranty is present where the top of the product warranty card clearly states 'European Bloc'.   
The Swiss note 4 appears to have its own product no N910FZKEAUT. Was going to bu y one for my niece in the uk but no good if the warranty won't work there.   
On a seperate issue are microspot good to deal with?

			As much as I hate to say it iTunes will give you access to an awful lot of stuff. It's not DRM'd these days which is a major plus. It is, however, AAC encoded meaning some players may not support it, but it is way better quality then MP3 especially at lower bitrates.   
If you really need mp3 format then you'll generally find the websites of the artists will sell mp3s or lossless directly.   
To be honest given the difference in quality between AAC & MP3 I'm surprised that MP3 still exists.

Strange because the photo printers are around 100 CHF and it is the same technology for the print except the tray.      How do you do that, will the adhesive tape stay on the plastic or it will transfer the print onto it and let it dry/stay there? Do you have some photos or name for this labels?      Thank you very much, this is what I need. I will search for this printer now, lol. Thank you for the offer, if I find the ink I will let you know, I need to print simple text on a plastic card, which is white and I need it not to smudge or anything and hopefully to be able to customize the area where it will go on the plastic, so I can have it in different areas etc. The problem is I need a different cards printer with something else on it, it will be used as a certificate stating a date and a serial number, that's why every time I print one it will be different than the other, the positive thing is I don't need any photo but only 2 lines of text on it. Again thank you for the offer.       Thanks, will take a look now.

			I live in Zug and have been having endless problems with Swisscom - one minute we have internet, the next not. The other problem is that our apartment is long and thin  and we cannot get wifi everywhere. 
I have a wifi amplifier thing, but it seems to be useless.   
I have rung Swisscom soooo many times.    
I THINK that one of the problems is that we pick up about 15 other wifi´s and so that causes intereference.   
Does anyone have any ideas?   
I am doing a distance learning course and it is online, so this is hell. 
Many thanks

			Good morning, 
I have some credit on my Swisscom mobile prepaid, however I'm changing the provider to Orange, therefore the balance with Swisscom will be lost.   
Is it possible to pay anywhere in Switzerland, France or on the internet using this balance? or maybe NFC?    
In the pas I could top up a VOIP provider account, but this option is not availabla now...    
thanks for info and have a good week ahead!

Price is CHF 39.50 per month. That's nearly 30 francs less than the current cheapest bundle from Swisscom (Vivo Light), and the only difference is that phone calls within Switzerland are charged on top of the monthly fee.   
That's also a little cheaper than UPC Cablecom's   bundle. The Light Combi does have faster Internet (5 Mbps vs 2) and free calls to fixed phones, but does not include Live Pause or VoD.

More recorded shows tonight that we could not watch. Last episode of Plebs on ITV 2. Sorry your recording is lost due a technical issue. Something we recorded on BBC HD (Prof Brian Cox) ....lost due a technical error.

I will talk to the landlords first, since I don't even know (at least until now I didn't) that any modem had such limitations, to see if they agree. :/   
But in case it's not possible, I would still like to hear about the options. 
I looked shortly on swisscom/cablecom etc. but haven't really found anything appropriate.

With aDSL and mobile Sunrise and others networks work all 100% 
Also a simple ping to my router doesn't receive an answer (it answer to others). 
For ex in my Firewall i see a VPN request, then it's send more time the 'OK' but never connect the VPN connection.     
Where is the problem? In Sunrise or Swisscom network? What's changed a month ago?     
Any IT expert here? Tnx for any help about this.

			After nearly 10 years I'm thinking of changing from Swisscom, and Orange have a pretty good deal going through the Post right now. (postshop.ch/abo).   
Most people I know are on Swisscom and I'm not in the mood to buy a prepaid just to check coverage, so does anybody know how good the Orange network is now? I was thinking of switching to Sunrise but now I'm not so sure...

			A mobile network will never be able to compete with a cable TV network (or a fiber optic network) in a fixed environment.   
With upc cablecom cable TV you can currently have 150 Mbps download speed all the time, and it doesn't matter if the fridge door is open, the blinds are down, or if some just walked past in their chain mail underwear.   
Where mobile beats cable hands down is a mobile environment: you can have internet in your car, on the train, in the toilet, or hanging off the clock face of Big Ben.    
Horses for courses.

			Hi there, 
In 2 months I'm going to move to Lugano. 
Now I'm looking for the internet connection. 
At the moment I live in Zurich and I have internet with cablecom (no TV) and it is pretty good. 
All the time the max speed is available, no downtime, etc. 
In the new apartment, cablecom is not available... and since I don't have a TV, Swisscom doesn't make sense. 
The only option could be Sunrise but I have read that they have quite often technical issue..so I don't know what to choose ... 
I have already checked local providers and comparis, but nothing interesting so far (Ticinocom??) 
Any suggestion? 
Thanks!

2) Payment online with your Maestro / Postcard / credit card (additional fees may apply)    
3) At your bank using the enhanced ATM (Multimat) (it's free)   
4) You can pay over the counter at any Swiss Post office (additional fees may apply)   
5)   (except for LAMal health insurance, rent and electricity). You can set up automatic payment (pre-authorized debit) by filling out a direct debit form (you need to ask Coop Mobile for their  ). This is similar to the payflow ACH payment Srvc in the States.

			SMSes are VERY reliable (>99.999% delivery), and they use signalling channel for delivery.  Which means that the message goes through even in case of overload on the air interface.    
Where the delay happens (where the bottleneck is) is usually SMSC.  It is a server for sending (and perhaps storing messages for later delivery).   I said ""usually"", but it depends from operator to operator.     You will notice that in times of peak SMS traffic (e.g. New Year's eve) the messages are delayed, since they are queued.     
The problem happens sometimes, when the number portability is used (i.e. number ported from one network to another).  Happens from time to time.

basically BC paid for phones4u with debt and some equity. later on, they issued ~£205m in PIK notes and paid themselves a dividend of around £230m which paid back their investment and made them £30m, thankyouverymuch.   
net debt went up to 2.2x EBIDTA, 4 times more than before the BC acquisition. unsurprisingly, suppliers such as vodafone were not too enamoured with dealing with such a high risk company no longer able to offer competitive terms.   
not long after, the PIK notes became worthless (say goodbye to your £200m investors) and it looks like the senior bondholders are also going to be shafted along with most of the other creditors (say goodbye to another ~£430m or so).   
well done, BC. you really manage to sucker everybody including the investors, employees and the tax man.

			Yesterday I walked into Coop and on my iPhone lock screen the supercard icon came up in the bottom left part of the screen, allowing you to access directly the Supercard app (or prompt you to install it from the App Store).   
Little did I know, this is a new feature of iOS 8 called App suggestions, which obviously work by detecting your location.   
In case you want to disable it, it is under Settings-->General-->Handoff & Suggested Apps.   
Also, if you are running the beta of OS X Yosemite, now you can answer a phone call from your Mac when both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network. To disable this, go to Mac Preferences-->General--> Uncheck ""Handoff"". 
This feature is supposed to work on your iPad as well (and in October you should be able to use the iPad for SMS as well as iMessages).

			Regarding the iPhone 5, the Apple announced free of charge replacement as long as your phone's serial number qualifies for such:    
Btw: I'm glad I found this thread again because after typing the serial it seemed like my model is eligible for repairs. Just need to take it to local Apple store and the whole process can take 4-6 days.

So yes, there is a price difference, but sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and go to the more expensive one.   
Also note that it will take you 2 months to switchover which you can expedite a little bit but you have to know that the option is there, noone will tell you that in the store or on the line without asking repeatedly to move before the Sunrise contract ends.

You still get Sky so you're generally pointing in the right direction, so you won't need for example dishpointer.com to get the general direction. Can you not usea spanner to loosen the bolts and get somebody to look at the signal meter on the TV while you make adjustments? Set the receiver to one of the Sky channels that works then make adjustments until you get the best possible signal. Hopefully this will then mean you have enough signal to get the other channels.

1025	01.09.2014, 22:00	Member	Thanked 60 Times in 36 Posts	Location: in transit	"    TV's and some other consumer electronics are often dual voltage so the only thing required may be a new cable or a plug adapter (check the label on the back to make sure). BUT caution your Swiss TV may not be able to decipher the coding of the cable signal from a US cable company, even with the US card in the reader (different standard). You may be able to get around this by having a US cable box, I don't know, but you are probably better off selling the TV/DVD/BluRay entertainment center here and buying new/used in the US. The DVD/BluRay reader also needs to conform to the region of the world where you will buy/rent your disks. Alternatively you could purchase a region-free player which would play both your US and Swiss libraries.   
Also, be aware that things with electric motors in them (like a washing machine or a kitchen mixer) tend to get hot and wear out much faster on a transformer (which will itself get really hot) than if they were run on their native power source. So think hard about what the replacement costs in the US will be for such things, because you might find you have to pay for them soon anyway.

The question is whether this HP is using a standard or non-standard PSU.  Standard = easy (try to) fix, bespoke = most probably beyond economical repair.

The answer I got was if left unused for 12 months the SIM cards automatically gets deactivated. 
But could anybody let me know if I could deactivate it immediately without waiting for a year??   
And after deactivation will the number be recycled as a new number in market or is it gone once for all so that no one can ever have it again?

			Ok so here is what happened... tl:dr version, I went through with everything, but the security people were a bit unfriendly.   
Long version where I rant (it is not an exciting epic, so up to you if you waste your time).   
I went with PLENTY of time and go through security. Take the laptop out as usual.   
Pass once, they ""rewind"" the conveyor belt, ask me to take out what I had there. I took out the monitor (I decided to take it as well) as it was covering everything else, go through again, rewind, then take then, hard drive and DVD drivem go through again, rewind, and had to take also take motherboard out (I'm not sure why as by then it would be super visible in their scanner.   
Of course by then I have essentially all my suitcase literally ""out of the bag"". No problem, I was sort of expecting that from the airport security, they are just doing their job, not their fault for stupid policies.   
Now after the machine they have a bifurcation with two conveyor belts. I had like half my stuff on each side for some reason. I looked around and there were no tables where I could repack so I just stay there, but in order to be less of an hindrance I get all my stuff to the side that is used less and start repacking, started by putting all my stuff in just one of those plastic trays so I was taking less space.    
Now getting all my stuff carefully in there so it has a low risk to get damaged obviously takes a while. About halfway through the re-packing, a security lady comes looking a bit annoyed with me and starts talking to me gin French. I asked if she could speak English please. She then tells me that I can't be there, I'm taking too long, they need the space to do security checks on other luggage. I look around and there is plenty of space on the other conveyor and there is even another guy on the same conveyor as me, getting checked as well (I think he also had a bunch of electronics, but just tablets and stuff). I double check if there are any tables for re-packing in the area, but they hadn't magically materialized since I had looked before.   
So I go, friendliest as possible ""Ok then, can you tell me where I should go to repack please?"". I resist the temptation to make a snide remark, she doesn't look pleased but doesn't address me more. After a bit more I'm almost done and a new security lady arrives wearing a different uniform (I think she must have been some type of manager) and goes stand behind me with the other lady that had talked to me before. They talk in French with each other, I know a bit of French and I think they were discussing me.   
I finally finish packing in a somewhat satisfactory way, and say farewell to my lady escorts.   
Eventually on the gate area I seated down on a place with some tables and redid a bit of my luggage.

I thought WebOS was pretty cool, too, and Palm now has a market share of 0.zip percent. So before I invest money into trying out a new platform, I want to see thousands of new apps pop up on it and a rising market share.

			I suspect the price increase is more to do with the fact that the world cup is about to start than dodgy dealing, an event like the world cup probably causes a spike in sales so they put up prices to take that into account.    
It could also be something as simple as they got a new delivery and the exchange rate changed.   
As for delivery, was it their delivery men or a third party courier, and did you pay for delivery and installation or just delivery?? If you just paid for delivery then I'm pretty sure somewhere in the small print it will say delivery is to the front door and if that is a communal front door then they unfortunately they fulfilled their commitment, yes it would seem to be a bit unfair that they expected your wife carrying your child to lug a big TV by herself, I have a sneaking suspicion that the same would hold true with any company.

			As of 20 August, prices have changed for  . I haven't seen or received any announcement - I found the change by sheer chance while using the website.   
You can see the new price list   and the old one  .   
For example, calling to a fixed line in the UK, France or Germany used to cost only the 0.29CHF connection fee, regardless of call duration. Now it will be 5Rp/min + connection fee. However, for some reason other countries (some of them fairly remote) still get the flat 0.29/call offer.   
Prices to mobile lines are lower now though.   
If you are a preexisting Lebara customer and you want to opt out of the new prices and keep the old ones, you can do it by sending an SMS with the text ""STAY"" to the number 255 before 1 January, 2015.

			we brought 2 tv's with us from the US, and purchased an additional tv in Switzerland.  the price of a good flat screen tv in Switzerland will be astronomically higher than what you can buy in the US, especially once you consider the exchange rate, and as has already been posted the transformer is inexpensive and easy to use.  our 2 tv's worked flawlessly for 2 years in Switzerland, and continue to work just as flawlessly in Luxembourg.   
our experience - learned the hard way - is that you should discount heavily any guidance you get about how hard it is to bring things with you from the US.  this is true for tv's, guitar amps, cars, and Lord knows how many other items.

			They lied to you. 
Why didn't you order the contract online? Their website is fully functional in English (if language was the issue) and it worked quite well in my experience (having started and renewed my contract several times, including once without any minimum duration).   
You could have signed a contract with no minimum duration, but in that case you would be paying the full price of the contract (as if you had got a subsidized phone). 
What you did is that you signed to stay for one year, and in exchange you got a monthly discount in your bill.  
Now if you want to cancel the contract there will be some penalty for this discount, but I'm afraid it will be higher that the money you have saved during these 8 months.    
The number to call is 0800 780 100 ( ). Good luck and let us know how much it will cost.

			Hi - Hoping someone can make suggestions or have an opinion on a TV issue I currently have with WWZ.   
We arrived in Zug in September 2013 and I took the option of WWZ Quickline Platinum package from WWZ. 
We have three boxes you could say, 
In my office we have a cable modem type box , that I have a telephone base for a cordless telephone plugged into and also a CAT 5 cable to a wireless modem. 
The cable modem plugs into the wall via a coax cable that came with the cable modem. 
All works well ....Good fast internet link.   
In the front room ...sorry lounge , we have a Quickline TV box that is also plugged into a wall socket with a coax cable (I think) that came with the box and the TV connects to the Quickline box via a HDMI cable.   
All of above has been working well. 
But two weeks ago we noticed that the weather updates on the interactive page via the TV box were no longer updating. 
But the main issue is that the TV guide is also not updating. This means in a few days we would not be able record upcoming tv progs.   
Called WWZ and  did the normal power off....check cable ....etc 
They then sent an engineer to check the signal strength that the engineer did at the cable socket in wall end and via removing a panel in the ceiling in the utility room near the electric breaker switch area on wall below. 
All tests passed ok and she agreed we had an issue and told me to get box swapped (TV box unit). 
So I did via WWZ shop in Zug and on return to apartment ...wired in box and it went into menu and all worked well. After a few hours the local weather all updated (5 day forecast) and the TV schedule updated to allow us to look ahead 14 days. 
But ...but ...after 2 days it has given up the ghost again and is no longer updating Grrrrrr  
Last updates were on the 30th of July.   
I have swapped the coax cable with the one in office ....just in case, but no joy.   
Ideas ? 
Other than refusing to pay bill and ditching WWZ and moving to Swisscom :-)

			Hi,   
I just wanted to say thanks again for this thread that is quite old, but is still very useful. I just moved and needed to resolve this problem again. I also had another curious problem that others might see. If I had the Thomson in ""disabled"" switch mode, yet had two connections on it, it seemed to cause problems for the Airport Extreme. Maybe it's because with switch mode disabled, using more than one connection doesn't make sense and the box was confused? I believe, with switch mode disabled, the Thomson should just pass the single WAN IP address on to the single connection (the Airport or other downstream router) and then the router takes care of the local network for everything else.   
I hope this helps someone else who might have this problem.

			I doubt that you can find such a dial-in number. I think your best strategy is to find a plan that has unlimited call to all operators, THEN find your dial-in provider. That's how I do it and I save a lot in international call costs.   
If you do mobile data, have a look at Yallo (yallo.ch). For 50 CHF/month you have unlimited calls and texts to any Swiss number + 1 GB for surfing.

Local electricians can sort out your wiring problems out with Swisscom.  It is up to you to get the wiring sorted, not Sunrise!   
Otherwise go to the nearest Sunrise shop and ask for help. If it is the wiring then Swisscom will not be in a hurry to fix it.

			Our time at school was plagued with such events:    - fill it full of gas from the brazing hearth in the metalwork lab and investigate what happens when ignited    - addition of a suitable battery, switch, two prongs, some quick wiring and a box nearly got us expelled    - find pipe to fit said pellet, attach spark plug at the bottom, fill with petrol, gas, whatever drop the pellet in the pipe and ignite.. (Discovered the benefits of rifling from this.)    - retreat to a friends house, use it to connect to Maplin Electronics computer-based ordering system and order a few thousand resistors and 10 satellite receivers on the schools account number.     - designed and built 20 of them and sold them all to the kids at school.

You'll be in for a rather unpleasant surprise if you get here and let the magic blue smoke out of your monitors (or other things).   
That said, most transformers are surprisingly cheap, considering what they do.

1078	14.07.2014, 19:49	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Zürich	"    Freeview is basically a service where you get a number of freely available channels at no cost, providing you have a TV/Set top box which has Digital signal capabilities. Freeview is not in itself a device, rather just a service which airs to devices. Many people may get confused because in the UK, boxes are marketed as Freeview boxes, but this is only because they either have no subscription capabilities or there is no subscription added (via TopUp TV CAM card). Using the set top box in Swiss would, in essence, make it a UPC Cablecom box, for example, adjusting for whoever gives you your standard digital signals (mine is Telecom Liechtenstein)   
So to the OP, no, you won't get Freeview in switzerland, but what should happen is that your Digital Box will scan for local channels - not channels belonging to Freeview - because Switzerland has different RF frequencies and also is not licenced to receive all UK channels.   
As another person said though, you can use Freesat here if you use a dish positioned correctly. The same applies with Sky Digital if you have an account and continue to pay - you can just simply position your dish very specifically to continue using.   
Information on Freeview and DVB-T, DVB-T2 (Both Terrestrial) and DVB-C (Cable) and also DVB-S (Satellite) can be found on the Ofcom website:    "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: May 2014	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Can I use my UK Humax Freeview in Switzerland?	checkov	Posts: 15

Has it worked in the meantime, apart from the series you wanted to watch?

Imagine a world where you could interchange routers or join a company using your own. They'd make less money from selling you trashy hardware....LOL. it's a shame that they don't sell people hardware with good reputation for reliability though such as Arris, Motorola, Linksys, Cisco, ZyXEL etc. It would cost them less overall as many reputed routers by these companies are less than $100 at retail, vs the CHF 180 for the Thomson/Technicolor stuff.   
Ironically I see that my router isn't even listed anymore there, but the Technicolor one is very VERY similar in my eyes. Did they just release a different colour of the same product but by Technicolor instead of Thomson? (they are indeed the same company).

I wanted to recover a laptop-drive (PATA) - would have cost about 2000 or 3000 CHF. 
Fortunately, I found a semi-old backup.   
Now, I use time-machine on the Mac. The only thing it does not do automatically is to create an offsite backup. 
In case of fire or water-damage, most likely my backup drive will die the same death as the main drive.

			Been on Lebara for ages without problems.. But today their topup system is broken it seems. Although I've done well out of it.   
I have mine and wifes phone under one online account, hers listed under friends and family. This morning I tried to topup both with 30.- each. The topup appeared online but no credit applied.. So I called them up, they said sorry and ""refunded"" me  .- for my trouble. The 80 appeared on my phone, great.. Even better, the original 60 then arrived on my phone, then another ""thank you"" 20.-   
However wife got nothing.. And she went to a shop to buy a topup and was told the system is down..   
Anybody else tried?

			Orange is pretty big in the French-speaking part of Switzerland.        
In Geneva Airport is an Interdiscount shop, you can buy SIM cards from Orange, CoopMobile and a few others there     
CoopMobile also uses the Orange network, but maybe has better prices. You can buy the SIM card on-line or in most large Coop sotres, or Interdiscount:     
Oh, 3G is mainly on 2100Mhz (also some 900MHz), and 4G is mainly on 1800MHz (maybe some 2600MHz and 800Mhz). So check that whatever unlocked phone you plan to buy supports those bands, so you can have access to 3G/4G, otherwise you will be stuck on the 2G network, which is fine for voice, but slow for data.

I would imagine full frame Sony mirror less cameras would be even better.   
2) The subject line reads ""DSLR & camera experts....."" and it indicates that OP is into DSLR and camera in general. OP does mention a Blackmagic range which to my eyes looked like a compact camera, pretty much similar to a mirror-less.   
3)I am on my fourth NEX now, and have been using them since NEX-3 was released (2011), and that is the main reason I recommended the e-mount mirrorless system. I think the ergonomics on the higher end magnesium bodied NEXs are excellent.   
here's my collection for proof  .        
 To me it looked like OP was enamored by a Blackmagic camera, and the first google search produced the following image, which to my eyes seemed like a compact video cam, and that is the second reason I suggested a NEX / mirrorless.       
My current NEX-5T is a great all-round camera and it does video very well (AVCHD 1080p 60fps). It also has both PDAF and CDAF, though I miss an OLED viewfinder and would upgrade soon. I can control it using my smartphone remotely as well. That is the reason I recommended NEX in the first place.    
I do not agree with your comment that mirror-less cams are just a party camera.    
My own experiences as well as that of many other users indicate to the contrary.       
I love to travel light and  I would trade bulk for slight loss in quality / features.   
p.s. I do not work for SONY

The first link I clicked on was a uk based site who will do it for £2.99 per roll for orders over 20.     
As you have 100, I am sure you can get this even cheaper by phoning them.         
Also there are probably other sites which do it cheaper.

			It has to be PS4 for me too.  I guess I was never really in danger of going down the Xbone route as I currently love my PS3, but I think their launch event (the one pre E3) was catastrophically poor.   
Like Krlock, I'm not that fussed about the media side of things - I have other ways of playing all my media through my TV (use a Mac Mini), but the blu-ray is welcome.  With the new generation of consoles though, I think now is the time I hope to move to totally virtual media, no more games boxes, etc etc, finally!   
Also, Watch Dogs as a launch title and a few strong games to follow has me drooling already.  I think once I finish 'The Last of Us', i'll sell my current PS3 as it will probably have no resale value come the end of the year.

It's very stable and speeds are fine, although not as consistent as UPC broadband. One issue can be latency since you tend to have more hops on mobile internet, but that doesn't affect/concern most people.   
At work, I have Spotify streaming from morning until it's time to go home on my phone. Streaming YouTube videos at 720p is not a problem.

It's pretty irregular here. Some evenings they are fine but most evenings BBC 2 becomes unwatchable for a couple of hours and BBC 1 is often badly affected too and they are the normal channels not the HD ones. I don't bother watching the HD channels. 
Friday evening was really bad and there was no signal on either BBC 1 or 2 all evening. It only seems to be an is due with the BBC channels all the others are fine.

Which brand/specific device would you recommend?

			Ok, I went to phones 4u (just happened to find the store, yes I know I should have gone on gocompare etc first but I am time poor etc etc).   
Anyways I explained the whole thing. The very helpful man in the store said no pressure and checked to see if it was unlocked, it was!   
I got a 30 day rolling pay as you go SIM card thingy (ie only give one month notice no long fix contract) with Orange with free unlimited texts and calls and 2G of data for 25 GBP. I thought that was quite good and left the shop happy.   
So it worked and just posting in case this helps anyone in future. Thanks

			Can your local TV dealer rent or lend you a TV with a CI+ connection (Slot)? then you can be sure the problem is in house or external. (Or maybe the card is defective)    
Sometimes it helps to pull the card out by 5 mm. Install all the TV programmes again (Search / Install) Then save and push the card back into the slot again.

But I think that you only need that for cable runs of like 50-100m or more. I have a 20-30m cable and there is no impact. I connected a meter directly to the LNB and at the end of the 30m cable, and the strength was about the same.

			Regardless of the little ego contest that seems to be happening in this thread (guys, surely you can find a mailing with Theo that's a better fit), changing your passwords too soon is as bad as not changing them at all in this case. If the server is is still vulnerable after you change the password (e.g. OpenSSL hasn't been patched, or keys haven't been changed, etc) then your new password is just as vulnerable to compromise.   
BBC was keeping a list of major services, their vulnerability and the patch status. If you want to be smart about it, look at that or a similar list and change your passwords on systems that have been fixed, one at a time.

			very common issue on the samsung 40 inch tv's (and the many many re-badged own brand ones)   
easy fix, just go on ebay and companies have put together kits to fix the power boards, only down side is you'll need to take the back off first to get your exact power board number, or just replace the whole board, again, plenty of refurbed boards on ebay.   
afriad its not a case of if but when they fail   inderdiscounts 'own' brand where rebadged samsungs, and it happened to ours. We only lost the HD picture though.

The simple reason for that is the security technology used in the TV does not support the newer WPA type ""encoding"" but only WEP.   
I would suggest you 1) try to connect using physical cable see if that works or 2) try to change the routers security to NON and then try to connect the TV, if it works then you know there is no issue with connection.   
Next step is to change the security to WEP (not all Wifi routers/access points have this option) but you can see if the encryption is the issue.   
if one of the solutions above work please let us know as this would help pinpoint the issue but if non work then its back to square one I am afraid.

Plug each TV into a socket and each TV works. Independently of all the other TVs.

The good news is that they're actually selling the 13.3"" model cheaper than the 11.6"" version (which is 979 CHF, with the same 4Gb/128Gb specs).   
The bad news is that this seems to be the   model they've reduced.

			We live across the water in Evian-les-Bains. 
Our advice would be to avoid Orange at all costs - here speaks the voice of experience. Waited nearly 5 weeks for the internet connection from one side of Evian to the other. Never again - but Neuf [as they were then] were not that much better. Perhaps better to stick to Swisscom after all?

Lets not forget there is Naked DSL available in Switzerland. I know Green used to do this.   
Anyway, both connections offer phone, Internet, radio and TV services.  There are providers who will offer connectivity either for one or the other.   
The question will be do you want very high speed?  Because the top connector may not give you as high speed as it will depend on the distance from the DSLAM (unless you have FTTH).

There's no way Netflix is going to expand to Switzerland - there's no money to be made here. Content rights are insanely expensive, downloading is legal here and the customer base per language is negligible.    
It's going to be very easy to get access to German netflix, though (although I doubt they'll have any decent / recent original-language content there - iTunes certainly doesn't).

			Hi,   
It is quite simple. There are the following ways to calculate a daily pro-rata:   
1) divide the monthly subscription amount to days in February (28 days) 
2) divide the monthly subscription amount to 31 days month 
3) divide the monthly subscription amount to 30 days month 
4) take the annual subscription fee (monthly * 12) and divide it to 365 days   
Obviously, the highest rate will come out if you choose February.   
Let's now take the example of ""we_da_man"" of a subscription worth CHF 65/month   
Option 1: 65 / 28 = CHF 2.321 per day pro-rata 
Option 2: 65 / 31 = CHF 2.096 per day pro-rata 
Option 3: 65 / 30 = CHF 2.166 per day pro-rata 
Option 4: 65 * 12 / 365 = CHF 2.136 per day pro-rata   
Therefore, they magically decided without no explicit reason to change the bill period exactly in February and calculate the highest daily pro-rata.   
So, 4 extra days in February * 2.321 = 9.284 + 65 = CHF 74.28.   
So far, so good, seems ""correct"". Also, I am not sure there is a specific law to address against the fact they decided to use the highest rate out of the 4 options. The most obvious one to have been used is the yearly average, which in turn would have produced:   
4 extra days in February * 2.136 = 8.544 + 65 = 73.54.   
There is a ""small"" difference of 0.74 rp, but multiply that with 1.5 Mio subscribers and you get roughly CHF 1'110'000 CHF extra revenue for Orange. Ok the number can be slightly different, but you got the idea.   
One will think what can be done to call justice upon the way they decided to pick up the month and the daily pro-rata.   
However, there is something more which is not easy to see. Everyone might think Orange is entitled to pick up whatever method they want out of the 4, HOWEVER:   
1. They could chose 6,7,8,9 as separate days in February (at the highest rate) + 10.02 - 09.03 monthly subscription, AS WELL AS they could chose 06.02 - 05.03 monthly subscription + 6,7,8,9 as separate days in March (at the lowest rate). And here is were I will ask in writing to Orange to change my billing period using THE SECOND OPTION, since is as valid as the first one (business wise as well as technical wise) and it is in my advantage, financially speaking.   
2. If they will not agree with the change of the bill, then according to their Terms and Conditions (See Section 12,    
""If you do not agree to essential changes to the Contract that are to your disadvantage you are entitled to terminate the Contract in writing within 30 days of receiving the notification.""   
Therefore, I will ask for Contract Termination. As easy as that. The problem is that very few people will get it and ask for the money back, and they will remain with most of the dirty profit.   
Add that to profit made by adding CHF 2/month to paper bills in the middle of contracts (assume 30% of the 1.5 Mio subscribers where not switching to e-bill * 2 CHF = potential of CHF 1 Mio/month additional revenue).   
Add that to charging the internet usage for people in this overlapping days as pointed by someone above (assume you had 1Gb of free internet per month, they did not change that to 1 Gb + 142 Mb for the additional 4 days), add that to the free minutes you have, they did not increased the free minutes with a pro-rata, add that to the issues they had with their system and the fact that they charge weird internet usage (we had an incorrect amount of internet moved to the first day of the next bill) and you will get a picture of the ways to make money in our days.   
Well, be it onto them, according to what they do.

			After three months using this product, I think I can give an updated review.    
Internet speed is consistently 5 Mbps +/ 10%, no matter the time or the day of the week. It's more than enough for our everyday use, and as I said, enough for streaming HD video.   
The router is quite good. I have had a couple glitches though: once the Wi-fi started acting up but resetting it sorted it out. And one night the modem lost all connection, but the next morning it was working again.   
Thus, I haven't needed to speak to customer service, apparently one of Cablecom's weaknesses.   
Television is what it is. If I want to record, I do that on an HDD connected to the TV via USB. Of course, not having the Horizon box means you lose VoD and replay functions but I can live with that.    
I also got my first bill and everything seems to be correct. However, it annoys me that it takes them six days to create a PDF for the bill, by which time you have barely two weeks to pay it.

Turns out, I think, that there was a java script error that needed to be fixed. Latest version loaded and I was back in action.    
Meanwhile, I converted my ""second"" router to an access point (AP), and - here's the bit I'm really chuffed about - found an old router which I converted to an another AP on my first floor - so I now have faster connections as well as wifi on my first floor.

			Well, I must say that unless you're arriving into Switzerland from the Nordics or South Korea, one thing that will positively surprise you; if that all providers meet (and often exceed) the pledged and advertised conditions/speed.   
In most markets, ISP's advertise under the ""up to"" caveat which usually means ""if all the stars align favourably, all your neighbours are gone and you log in at 4am in the morning"". 
So getting what's advertised, and then some, is always a pleasant surprise.

because the internet was not working upon connecting the InternetBox initially I called Swisscom support a couple of times, and they were also not able solve things.    
So, they sent a technician who spent 2 minutes confirming that everything was OK from my side, and then 2 hours calling swisscom services and central in order to work things out... He left without solving the problem.    
2 days later I finnaly got Internet Connection.   
So now I receive the bill and I was charge 86.40CHF for the service.    
Promptly called SC who told my that: ""If it was SC fault I would be charged, and normally is over 200CHF, they just charge me for the ""travel"" of the tech. and 6.40 for something else"".   
I explained that the tech. did nothing and the I don't agreee with this charge, when the operator told me that I've sign on that already so I have to pay.   
I proceed to explain that I sign on a machine with nothing written on, so I though it was just to attest that the technician was in fact at my place.   
After a while she offer to give me a voucher for 40CHF so we would split the costs, and that the call had already passed the 'normal' time so we have to finish.   
I respectfully declined and told her to passe me to her supervisor. I am now expecting a call from them.     
... 
From your (the forum) experience regarding similar issues, what's your advice?    
because the tech. gather my signature on a blank screen machine, this means that I can be charged to whatever he wants? What's the usual position of swisscom (or most Swiss companies) on these matters?

Does anyone use the  service because this is the one I tried first. Seeing as they offer a no obligation, no credit card 7 day trial it will do me as an introduction to the topic. To cut a long story short I managed to change the SmartTV connection settings (DNS) to the one provided by Cactus and after a few firmware upgrades (SmartTV and 5OD) I managed to get all the UK streaming apps working except BBC iPlayer and iTV!   
The thing is the Cactus service explicitly states that none of the UK channels will work on the SmartTV, link      
My question - does the  service work on the SmartTV for BBC and iTV players? If it does then I'll have no hesitation to fork out the fiver it costs per month.

			I have a Swiss and a US account. I never lived in the US and only have a couple of Swiss credit cards, so what I did was this: I opened a new account on of course a different e-mail address, filled in a fake US address (just looked up a random address on Google Maps; they never check unless they have to send you something, which they don't), chose ""none"" when prompted to enter credit card details, and then I bought (and still buy) vouchers off Ebay to buy stuff in the US store. Works like a charm.   
I'm sure it works the same for the UK store.    
If you have a UK/US/whatever credit card, you can save yourself the hassle of buying vouchers off Ebay. Even though ""hassle"" isn't the right word as it hardly is one - I always use the same seller and they send me the codes within 10 mins.    
I've had no trouble so far with updates either. I can also easily switch back and forth between my two accounts (though these days, I hardly use the Swiss one anymore anyway).

			Hi Emmcee, 
I have a situation pretty similar to yours (me and my gf, 2 laptop, 2 mobile devices using often skype or viber, even in the same time) and we had upc cablecomm at 32Mbit, recently upgraded at 50Mbit. 
Already before we could always get at perfect speed! Streming without waiting times and excellent skyping...I would say that the upgrade (decided by them) didn't really change a lot, probably wifi and other stuffs are enough bottleneck to don't feel any difference. 
Anyhow, I would reccomend you the 50Mbit, I really have nothing to complain about! 
cheers

			Thanks Prishe - I missed that. That's a big minus.. we rarely watch anything live, preferring to record and watch later (skipping the ads). I suppose we could add on the 'replay' option in order to be able to rewind up to 7 days to catch up on programmes that way, but that relies on us remembering within 7 days..   
shame :-(   
I guess I'll just keep an eye on it and see if they decide to offer it later.

			I went with orange me yesterday. Getting a contract is not a problem for them  so long as you have your residence permit application receipt - I've been here less than a week. 
They give a good discount for sim only and an extra discount for 2 year contracts. What they also don't mention on the website (or at least I didn't notice it) but told me in the shop is that the 40chf for the sim is converted into account credit. Took me less than 30 mins to get a sim from them.

Maybe I'm just too friendly and pay the bills   at least I don't live in fear of Billag Man... I actually enjoy watching the TV, and although I admit it IS expensive, other taxes seem quite reasonable compared to neighbouring countries. Swings...roundabouts...

			Hello! Moving to Switzerland (Avenches!) soon, for a six month grad school project. I have been researching what to do about being connected. I don't have to worry about wifi; it's available where I'll be. And from perusing this board, I've got some ideas about some good prepaid SIM cards and companies... so the only question left is where to buy, rent or borrow a smartphone while I am there.  
I don't need anything brand new, just a phone that can handle GPS and translation apps in case my language learning falls short or I'm lost in a strange city or the other various things that come up as a native English speaker in Switzerland! Do you have any suggestions for good websites to look through/post on in this search, or are there any particular shops which rent phones? I'll be in Bern my first day, so I could look around there as well, in the area near the University of Bern. Just hoping for some recommendations before I get there!  
Would it be cheaper to just to outright buy a phone there instead of trying to rent one, or maybe even before I leave Scotland?   
Thank you and cheers!

			Thank you for your response and info. I will ask to find out if there is another number I can use instead of 058.   
But I still find it very dishonest of Orange that they do not mention charges, or that it is not included in their flatrate contracts anywhere (apart from the site you discovered, where it refers to a different service). I also re-checked my contract, nothing is mentioned.   
For example it was quite easy to find  , and according to that they do not charge for 058.   
Basically I will take my contract and last bill -when I receive it- to an Orange center and ask to cancel, see what they say.

Or better said, YOU were paying it as part of your rent even though you had Swisscom.  But as far as I know, even if you have Swisscom, you still have to pay for the cable connection.   
Either way, its a rip off.  This cable connection charge should be included as part of the service.  Its like when you buy a car and then you are told that, by the way, you need to pay for the tires too, because without them, you can't move the car, and that's a separate charge.  This scheme might be used to make costs seem lower, and make it more attractive to customers.  I don't know if customers would normally think there is an additional cable connection charge on top of their package / subscription.

			@Paul 
Since I started this thread it's all working now. My 'problem' with the phone plug/socket turned out to be that the socket is spring-loaded - push the plug in fully, and the connection is made. 
But 4 hours to connect ?? Outrageous !! Yer Mum's been ripped off by 3.5 hours. My Mum could connect this up herself, and she's 91 and blind. Maybe the engineer spent  bit of time tidying the cables away more nicely that I do, but even so ....

			As a follow up to my last post, they have recently upped the speeds of their packages and lowered the prices slightly e.g. my VDSL connection is now 40,000 / 4,000 kbit/s compared to 20,000/2,000 before.   
As my yearly renewal began approximately 2 weeks before they released the new packages, I paid the old price. I saw the new information on their website and had to request the upgrade myself. I had to make a follow up call a couple of weeks later but then they made the change quickly and without fuss.  I won't receive any refund on the money I already paid but I've now been here long enough to feel grateful that they did the upgrade and won't fight the ~CHF80 I 'lost'.   
In short, if you are still waiting on fibre or want to avoid cablecom, their packages are good value and from my experience very reliable. The only negative point is their customer service always feels a bit basic.

			What annoys me about Swisscom are all these advertisements about their glass fibre cable and how one can get 1 GB a second. In Zürich hardly anyone has the new cables so what is all the advertising about?And it will probably be years before its standard for Swisscom.       
After checking: 
 ""  
""1 Gbit/s is not (yet) available at Am Börtli , 8049 Zürich. Fibre is the requirement for 1 Gbit/s. We are constantly extending the Swisscom fibre optic network – near you too. Do you want to be notified?""

I'm in the process of evaluating providers that house their servers in Switzerland. I've been using Google Apps for Businesses accounts for the last 7 years and I don't want to have a decrease in comfort. What I need:   
- Push E-Mail, calendars + contacts for my phone and iPad   
A decent web interface (that works both on Mac OS and Windows) with a reasonably powerful search that can easily handle a 3gb mailbox.    
Does anybody have any experience with Hostpoint's Open X-Change solution? Would that fit my needs? Any other suggestions? I'm willing to pay up to 30 Fr. per month for this.

			Hi there,   
We have been with SolNet for the last eight year and always been happy. However, lately there are more and more issues and their prices are just too high. Looking around, we decided to move to upc-cablecom.   
Now, we are not quite sure as of when this can be done and perhaps there is somebody here who could advise.   
Our original subscription with SolNet ends on 22 July 2014. BUT, in October 2013 we increased our internet speed from 10 Mbits/s to 30 Mbits/s and had a confirmation from SolNet that our subscription now runs until 22 May 2014.   
The original contract had to be agreed for two year which ends on 22 July 2014. With SolNet's  confirmation until 22 May 2014, does this mean that we can change as from May 2014?   
Thanks.

			I just switched to a smartphone.  I got a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 specifically because I wanted to use it for hand-written notes.     
After purchase, I discovered that S Note, the Samsung note taking app, is designed to sync easily with Evernote as a way to get the notes on other computers (Macbook in my case).  I am not an Evernote user, but this sounded good.   
Here's my problem - if I create a note on the Galaxy Note 3, it appears in Evernote on my Macbook as a non-editable .spd file.  It is non-editable for notes that are still in hand-written form (not surprising), but also for notes that have had script recognition and are converted to ASCII text.  Even worse, the .spd seems to be an image and I cannot even copy-paste the text.  I cannot find any way to edit the note, copy text, or change the note format.   
Does anyone know if it is possible to take S Note notes on a Samsung Galaxy Note, sync with Evernote, and be able to edit on a Macbook?     
I am also googling for this and contacting Evernote, but just was thinking there might be some knowledge on the English Forum.  Thanks!

			You needn't worry. What was rejected was the sale to UPC Cablecom of the part of Naxoo belonging to the city of Geneva.    
The migration of the Naxoo customers to UPC Cablecom (and the replacement of hardware) is a different thing.    
They just happened at the same time, which I think muddied the waters a lot.    
The only lasting effect of the no-sale is that Naxoo is now renting the connections to UPC.

			Naxoo's shares held by the City of Geneva that were to be sold will now remain in municipal hands. As to what this situation will bring for the evolution and improvement of the Naxoo cable network, I have no idea. Maybe they'll check out what Lausanne will be launching at the end of the month? ( They're due to come up with what I hope will be a credible and competitive offer compared to what Cablecom provides, since for Lausanne Citycable subscribers we don't get the full Cablecom offer (lack of bandwidth I suspect) despite paying full price...).

			You usually only need to convince the BBC (or whichever channel) you're in the UK whilst you open the page containing the media content.    
iPlayer has changed recently in that there's a few seconds of an intro before it reconnects to show the main program. Once the main program starts you can disconnect from your VPN (especially if you're using a free one with bad bandwidth) and watch directly.   
For the live content on BBC Sport it's more tricky. I've found I need to switch the proxy (from ON through the VPN or whatever to OFF/direct) whilst it's showing the ""loading"" spiral logo. Too early and you get a ""can't be viewed in your location"" error. Too late and ""there is a problem with this video feed"". I've got it sussed    
I have a domain hosted in the UK, and that provides telnet access to my account. Firefox (with the free putty telnet client) can route web traffic via this, which is based in the UK. However, I have such a cheap package they don't provide the bandwidth for watching hours of live TV, as I did over the weekend, hence my ""switch it of at the right time"" trick.   
This also works with the free Tor/Viledia ""UK exit point"" method - google for that. It's free but a bit more complex.

I don't carry mine around and use it 99% of the time connected to an external monitor. It is something I had not considered, which is why I mentioned it here.   
If carrying it around, I would go for high res. The alternative is to use a very high res external monitor to obtain a similar DPI, which are expensive. It all depends how you intend to use the laptop I guess.   
I read Windows may one day support different DPIs on dual displays to solve this problem.

			All,     
despite trawling the offerings from Swisscom, Sunrise & Co., I have been unable to find a company that offers (at least) a European Flat rate with internet.   
Perhaps that is too easy today, most of their ""offers"" seem to focus on television packages etc.   
Here in Germania, Vodafone have a Europe/Australia/america telephone Flat Rate and 16Mb internet package for 49 Euro / Month.   
Perhaps I have missed something?     
Appreciate any ideas.

			Using XBMC on a jailbroken ATV2 to stream movies from 1Channel, ProjectFreeTV and IceFilms. Not very reliable, as it seems many of the streams do not work. And it often needs to buffer for a while.

I don't think Vodafone is traffic shaping, as our problems started in early January and are constant. If we are gone for a few days, everything does NOT work when we return and then tail off. And Vodafone should have been able to tell us if our consumption levels were triggering something. After 10+ calls and a home visit, I think they would be motivated to fix the problem or tell me that they are throttling us.

1) You can get a perfectly good unblocked Nokia phone from MediaMarkt or Conforama for CHF 30. Here is the link to Conforma's site to show you the model.    
2) I would go with a pay as you go (pre-pay) with Orange. They are one of the big operators and for 2.5 months I would not sign a contract or go with one of the smaller ones. Orange will be you best option (quality/price) for making calls.   
3) From my understanding you will just need your passport as ID.   
4) I would wait until you are in Winterthur. Or you could have a colleague buy the phone for you so you just need to go to an Orange shop to sign up. Will be worthwhile to take a German speaking person with you.

In Canada it will work perfectly fine for calls on the GSM network. But no 3G network is 1900 only. 
You should completely avoid Telus and Bell as operators since they do not operate a GSM network (they use a different 2G technology) and their shared 3G network is not 1900-only. I recommend you to only choose amond the operators that appear to run a GSM network   and if I may ""dictate"" your operator, only use Rogers/Fido, or any operator with a national roaming agreement with Rogers.  
This way you will always have the GSM network to fall back to, and hopefully Rogers' 3G network will be deployed on 1900 MHz where you happen to go.

			hi,   
Where did stickers wit buy this computer? if It isn't a fake one: You should have a stickers with the licence. if yes did call microsoft to be sure the licence is valid? (084 8858 868) It can happen that the licence isn't registered correctly. 
Usualy you can get office demo after 1 month then you should buy the licence but for windows I never hear about it.   
Tell me back,

			Hello Defcon. Many thanks for taking the time to reply to me so fully. I have now made the change from prepaid to prepaid. Apparently it will take ten days or so to take effect. Actually, Swisscom prepaid is pretty interesting, as a 60 min call will never cost more than 60 cts.

I have an abo (99CHF/month for unlimited data) with Swisscom and use the trains regularly with a laptop tethered to my iphone 5, never really had a problem. Occasionally I lose connection and a minute or two later I'm back online.   
Be careful which ago you get though, my wife also has unlimited data from Swisscom with the 75CHF/month package and the slow speeds make it practically unusable in some places.

			I am also in the process of re-evaluating my internet/phone connections. What looks interesting at the moment is   [1]. They have been laying fibre throughout town and for 39,- you can now get a 10 MBit symmetrical connection. They have also set up a   [2] around town onto which you can register 1 device (by MAC address), and therefore whilst in town you will not need a cell phone data connection.    
As there is only limited need now in Luzern for mobile internet I have switched to a pre-paid account with Swisscom. I too rarely make calls, and mostly use wifi on the phone when at home or in the office. So I use the   [3] which charges you 9,- for 100 MB of data. As I'm using a couple of hundred max a month, it's a lot cheaper than the 49,- a month I was paying for a contract before.    
At home I am then using   [4] so that I can stream netflix, and the BBC iPlayer. It almost means I can cancel my cablecom TV contract, but I still want a couple of live sporting events...   
Good luck with your choices and welcome to Luzern

			Thanks again - so it seems I got one SIM too few. The SIM I have does not, in fact, have a phone number on it. The package however is called ""Welcome to PostPay"" - so I would guess that's the SIM I am going to use once my old number is active. I did not however receive a SIM card with a temporary phone number I am supposed to be using until my old ALDI number is active with Orange - which is the one the CS asked for when I rang them to check up on my transfer status. I would also guess the information on whether or not a number is assigned to the SIM that I had received would be on the actual contract - that I don't have, neither on paper or sent over via email.   
I will definitely drop in by Orange in Winterthur and ask the assistant two things - one, where is my contract and why haven't I received it yet, in paper or electronic form and two, what's the situation with the temporary number, since that is the first thing the Orange CS person asked for when trying to check my information through their system. It is possible I am NOT in their system yet, although I signed the contract on Dec 27th.    
Thanks again for all your tips - they did help clear a few things up.

also be careful, there's a new ransomeware malware out there which is not in your antivirus definitions - targetting German speakers and running on an ad network. I've spent the morning dissecting it.   
It will lock your computer and prevent you using it until you pay the ransom. And it claims you've been downloading movies, music and so on.

			I think the Notes are brilliant. I had the first Note it was the first time since the whole world used Nokia that I could get more than a day out of my phone. The Note 3 is a good buy in my opinion. The downfalls are that the screen is over saturated and the expense in Switzerland. The photos I have seen from it are incredible!

Considering the fact that Swisscom isn't bound by the original iPhone contract anymore and doesn't sell the iPhone at heavily subsidized prices with SIM-lock anymore, this sucker ain't gonna sell in Switzerland. Sure, the zealots will be waiting in line come December, but after a week, the hype will be over and everybody will be getting the S4 at 1/2 the price instead.

I haven't had any problems with my xbox 360 connecting to wireless because we always use a wired connection, but some of the problems I have had with connecting was due to the network settings I had on the Xbox.

			This was my first experience of online shopping with Microspot. I bought a mobile phone 2 weeks ago. Soon after the phone arrived, I discovered that it was defective, so I called them. They said that I should sent them back the phone for a reparation, and according to their policy it is not possible to change for a new one. I was surprised by that, since in any normal shop if a product arrives defective it will be exchanged directly for a new one rather than reparation. OK I admit that maybe this policy was written somewhere and I did not read it before making the order...   
So I sent them back the phone last week for a reparation. They said the repaired phone would arrive at my home this week. Then today I called up again, this time they said the phone is in the service center and they don't really know when it will be done, MAYBE in two weeks.   
Well, I am a little bit disappointed. Also, I paid the product 2 weeks ago and now I cannot use it. And all this is not my fault, and in the same time the price of the phone is dropping on their website (in the past two weeks it has dropped already by 30 CHF). So today on their hotline I also asked a reimbursement of the difference between the price that I paid and the price when the good-functioning product will arrive at my side. But the receptionist on the phone said she cannot decide this. she will ask and if they can do something they will contact me later (I think that they will simply not contact me at all).   
Well, my first experience with them, not so brilliant... Anyone else have similar experience with them?

			Just to tell the end of the story...   
I took the media box and modem back to the service point in Renens on Saturday, who accepted it without a problem (even though it was minus the  
packaging).   
They couldn't do anything about the bill as they are 'not Cablecom'. However they could see my file and told me I was definitely listed as having cancelled my contract from October.   
So I rang up Cablecom today and asked them, very politely, to explain why I had  
a bill for November when I'd cancelled my contract.    
They explained, equally politely, that even though the bill said 'November' on the top it was actually October's bill, and directed me to the small print.   
After pointing out that that was a very confusing practice I accepted that I do indeed have to pay this bill, but was assured I would not be receiving any more.    
The upside of it is I am now 100% certain my contract has been cancelled.

			It really puzzles me how LTE phones/tablets need to be finetuned so often in order to work on each individual LTE network. 
E.g. this issue that Castro reported with the G2. 
Or how the iPhone 5 did not work on every LTE network globally, but first Apple had to send a firmware update to let it connect to each network.   
This is not the case with 3G.  (every WCDMA phone connects automatically to every WCDMA network as long as they support compatible frequencies).  
Hopefully this will stop with the next generation of LTE antennas.         There's no need to feed the troll.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Nov 2007	Groaned at 94 Times in 75 Posts	Orange 4G Network settings	Castro	Posts: 4,796

			Thanks for the thoughts, but I've done that hitherto and it doesn't work for us. Problems are firstly that the calendar needs to be public (which we don't want), and secondly that a number of members prefer not to use Google if poss. Nobody is on Google+ - only half the band is even on FB. 
However, it's a potentially good solution that could well be of use to someone else.

			Hi Slaphead   
No, problem not fixed yet. 
A new sunrise modem arrived last Friday but sunrise will not activate it until Sept 12th. 
I tried a couple of modem/routers; one 3 months old & the other about 3/4 years old.  Symptom is always the same; ADSL modem synchronises but no PPP connection.   
About ""Sunrise are gradually moving all their subscribers to a new slightly faster circuit""   
Seems likely; might be linked to the TV services  going HD & possibly migrating the current ADSL-lines to VDSL2 although as ADSL is a point to point service it should be technicaly simple to continue to support legacy modems.

			Ok, it's not working properly, and from what you've done and observed it would indicate a hardware fault. So send it back.   
I remember years ago, before the internet even existed for private people, that things also broke down. As a result of the lack of internet we couldn't ask what to do in the event of a faulty product. As a direct consequence of this my mother still has a garage full of faulty stuff that I simply couldn't work out what to do with.

			I was a few key presses away from signing up for my 10 chufs free VOD sub., but have since found other alternatives (although their film rental prices seem better than others).   
Their TV package (no set top box required with Samsung Smart TV) is a good option if no alternatives are available, but is comparatively limited on Brit. channels.

			Depends a little bit on what kind of content and functionality you want.  If it's mostly just text, I'd find a cheap website host and use Wordpress.  It's pretty powerful and extremely easy to maintain.   
Otherwise, I'd look into a more sophisticated CMS -- Drupal, for example, can be configured to do just about anything you want it to.     
With Drupal, you're more likely to have to dip into the code from time to time.  Wordpress is pretty much consumer-friendly now, with all the routine tasks automated down to a button-click.  (Gone are the days of importing modules via FTP -- now you just click 'install' and it's done automagically).

It's not much of a looker (which is one of the factors I don't care about), but it's surprisingly recognisable. I don't know how Microsoft did it, but my students immediately recognised the thing and it turned out that two of them had bought one, too (one of which is a girl, btw., so apparently the SP2 is hip enough to appeal to a female audience as well). Also, Microsoft actually is playing it too safe after the Surface / Surface Pro 1 debacle - demand is much higher this time around but supply is close to non-existent, especially for the most sensible versions (128gb and 256gb). The female student was unlucky enough to get one with a faulty power supply and Interdiscount told her they only have 17 of them left in all the shops in Switzerland combined. They're transferring one over from Zurich for her

			I switched to the Swiss store to get the Zattoo app.  It's possible (I don't know what a ""match"" account is) to change the country of a standard Apple ID, but at the time I needed it I didn't know how to do that so simply created another apple ID for the Swiss store.   
I use my UK cards when outside of Switzerland (I shop regularly just over the borders in France and Germany) - Nationwide for credit, Metro Bank for debit as they're both commission free on foreign currencies.   
In Switzerland I use my bank card (Postfinance) for debit and very rarely, my Halbtax Visa card for credit.  I usually buy everything on the debit card as interest rates here are too low to think about what the savings will be on a month's extra interest.   
You're doing well if you get a place big enough that you need the home plugs things.  Just get an additional wifi router which can work as an extender.  That's what I would do (not that I need such a thing in my 50sqm flat).   
Finally, when I've needed Cablecom support they've been excellent.

PM me if you want more details. It can be done on the original AppleTV, but if yours is starting to fail, you might need to replace it. I have the original, also, but chose to only jailbreak the ATV2.

			When I record a show on the Cablecom Médiabox, I have problems with the subtitles that are too fast on ITV1 HD and Channel 4 H (since the 16th october 2013),  
could somebody tell me if there would be the same problems (recordings with subtitles ITV1 HD and Channel 4 HD) on the Horizon box?

			I had that problem with a more modern modem they sent me. The solution was to keep the old one that covered half of the city ( it's a figure of speech). So just call Cablecom until you get a strong enough signal from whatever modem. Being nice to them and keep repeating the same thing until they act did work for me. Patience pays if coupled with stubbornness.

			Gee, now I think I need a mini, although I looooove my iPad.  I have a 1 and 2 and when using my mom's new model, could tell instantly the dofference in the resolutin, so of course I want one of those.  I think I need ""both"".  So, if it is between a mini with the new screen/resolution vs. IPad 2, I would get the mini.     
The iPad 2 was termed ""mommy's iPad"" in our house.  However, I have recently been asking the kids why mommy never seems to get to use it anymore and is left with the old one and hundreds of kiddie apps have appeared on ""mine""....perhaps it's time to change the password on my iTunes account, perhaps.  At least they always only put free things on without asking!

			As my orange contract is soon to its end, I'm considering transferring to Swisscom for a new contract. And as I already have a recent phone I'm not planning to change it.   
After a little search online, it seems to me that for Swisscom, the monthly fee is the same with or without a new phone. For example, Natel Infinity L is 129 CHF/month with or without a new phone. Is this true? So it's different from orange? (At orange if you take a new contract without taking a new phone, you pay 20 CHF/month less, as part of the monthly fee is the payment for the phone by installments)...

			If you dial  you get a message ""2 Rappen per minute"". This is a connection through Helvatel.ch.   
You then dial the full UK code including 0044 and add a hash to the end of the number.    
This costs  /minute to the UK and is charged on your Cablecom monthly bill...

			Rainy day today so I decided to compile into a post some data that I gathered when I started this thread.      
What I find interesting about these stats so far in 2013, is that the top 6 companies have been quite stable. 
It is only Samsung and Apple of course, and then the spots 3-5 have only been taken by LG and the 3 big Chinese guys (Lenovo, ZTE, Huawei). 
IDC and Strategy Analytics do not agree 100%, but this is because most companies do not announce their real sales so they have to estimate them (unlike Apple's or LG's numbers on which they agree).   
According to IDC it goes like this: 
Q1 - - - - Q2 - - - - Q3  
Samsung - Samsung - Samsung 
Apple - - Apple - - Apple  
LG - - - - LG - - - Huawei  
Huawei - - Lenovo - Lenovo  
ZTE - - - ZTE - - - LG    
According to Strategy Analytics it is like this: 
Q1 - - - - Q2 - - - - Q3  
Samsung - Samsung - Samsung 
Apple - - Apple - - Apple  
LG - - - -LG - - - -Huawei  
Huawei - -ZTE - - - LG 
ZTE - - - Huawei - -Lenovo    
It is interesting that only 6 companies are found in both these lists. 
In the past, and I am not exagerating at all, the spots 3 to 5 went to completely different companies from quarter to quarter, e.g. Sony, HTC, LG, ZTE and Huawei were in and out all the time while Nokia was slowly losing ground until it completely dissapeared.   
But now it looks like Sony and HTC cannot keep up with the Chinese invasion and only LG manages to survive in the top 5. 
Of course I cannot know how far from the top 5 they are, e.g. Sony may have been missing No5 for a few thousand devices, but since we only have the top 5 announced public, we can only make conclusions based on that.

			I got my DSL canceled without sending anything to them. 
I called this special hotline number that you also mention for canceling the subscription and I got to them pretty fast.   
The guy was a bit frustrated when he didn't convince me to stay, but hey, this is life.    
At what time do you usually call? 
I called before 9 am.     
By the way, you are obviously late, so be prepared to pay quite a bit. 
This is why i left Sunrise. They are extremely aggressive in not letting you go, so I called after the 9th month of my DSL to make sure that I will have it canceled exactly when the 12 month is over.

I'm quite happy with the service and fee as it is so dont want to change it. Does anyone know if I just source a CI+ CAM (and where) myself and still use the Card from the mediabox in the CI+ CAM?

			We recently switched to Migros internet and TV.   
Internet is fine.   
TV is dreadful. We have spent so much time on the phone to customer service that we now have our own dedicated advisor who has given us his name and asked us to always ask for him (no, I'm not joking). TV cuts out, the pause, rewind and replay functions are erratic, sometimes the TV will 'jam' in the same place in a programme and no amount of pausing, rewinding and replaying with get over the jam, and sometimes it just stops working.    
We hoped the issues would resolve themselves over time but they aren't.    
Depends how much you like watching TV... and how quickly you are frustrated.

			We are doing an apartment renovation and have been quoted by the electrician for using Digitalstrom. It avoids a lot of wiring (you just need each point to be power connected, but not directly with each other) but its not clear to me that this system is particularly unique. On one swiss forum it is described by an installer who did a training course as expensive and not flexible enough to rely on for the long term (vs KNX et al). Certainly our quote came to a much larger figure than expected. Am going to do some more research...

			So I went for the Swisscom TV Light offer for 0CHF/month. I got 4 months of whole channels bouquet offer for free. Pretty impressive offer I must say. 
I have now on set-top-box ""only"" 80 channels but very limited english channels (BBC2,BBC3,ITV1 not available). I installed the Swisscom TV app for iPad and noticed that I have access to a much wider choice: BBC2, BBC3 and ITV1 are available. Since I have an appleTV at home I'm airplaying now all theses channels on my appleTV......for 0CHF! Quality is not HD but very acceptable and switching between channels is really OK.   
I guess they don't check properly the rights/subscriptions for tablets. Anyone else can check if they have the same possibility?     
PS: I'm glad I canceled all my contracts with Cablecom and their poor customer support. So far Swisscom has been great.

			In my experience, they are not in a hurry to do this for you and will try to bill you for the time that they believe the connection was active. 
Send your disconnection request with registered post and make sure the technician gives you a written confirmation that he has disabled the connection before he leaves.

you can get anyone of those two boxes from Comag to do that, they are android based and have the ability to record. Saw the one without the tuner at real in Germany for EUR79.     
they also have this one now different brand but same functions    
suggest you look at ebay, plenty of sellers have those kind of boxes for as low as USD35.   
good luck

			...... or all day and all night, if you want.   
For today only Wibi TV on their free app. within an app. (Hollywood Wibi Free) are offering a selection of 29 classic (and maybe not so classic) horror films - replacing their normal 9 free films for just one day.   
Wibi can only be accessed from the Flipps (formerly iMediaShare) app. - free or 5 chufs for HD playback, for both IOS and Android mobile devices.   
Select a film on your gadget and watch it on your Smart TV via your home network wifi as many times as you want - for free (automatically - no set up required).   
I know this post is a bit spammy, but I have no affiliation with the two products mentioned above, but just believe this is a great product, and a good Halloween offer.   
Gawd bless the Dutch.      supported TV's at the bottom of this link.   
Unfortunately, the horror film selection for today can only be viewed from within the app. and not from the web site.

The more satellites you wish to receive the higher the price. 
If you want all possible satellites you may need to install multiple dishes. 
You can spend anything from 100 CHF to 1 million CHF.      Get permission from building owner to install the dish or dishes, then install them      Impossible. The fact that we live on a planet that is round and governed by laws of physics means you cannot receive signals from satellites you cannot see.   
Just like when the sun is on the other side of the planet you cannot se it, so is also true for satellite signals. You cannot receive signals you canno see.   
USA and South America are classic cases of countries where the satellite signal does not reach Europe.

			My assumption would be that if you sign up for a contract that says 45 a month you will pay 45 a month for two years starting from the date of the new contract. This is a new offer to replace your old contract. As the chances are that your current contract will auto renew forever (unless a term in the contract fixes the discount period - you did read the contract you signed didn't you?) at 15 a month I wouldn't take this offer.   
For an extra 300 or so you can buy an unlocked one from Apple. It will hold its value better and you can sell it whenever you want to upgrade without worrying about it being tied to a contract.

			I can only recommend to stay away from Sony. Granted it's a small sample size, but all the people I know with them have problems with them breaking. Right now I've got a Toshiba (went for the cheapest) and it works fine.   
As for an OS, I can also recommend Ubuntu, it starts, shuts down and runs much faster than the windows also installed on my laptops (dual boot home and work laptops). It's not full of crap, it does automatic updates much nicer than windows, I never worry about viruses or bank security, it's just so much nicer to run.

I rang Pure in the UK and they posted a new one out to me.  I also had problems wirelessy streaming my own music onto the radio (from my pc) and again rang Pure and had several calls/emails with different versions of software where they eventually managed to sort it out.   
So in short not a terribly reliable product but a totally brilliant customer services department.  Whenever I rang, I got the feeling it was quite a small set up .. don't know if that's right.   
So probably I'd steer you towards logitech even though I have no experience of that product.  DrMom is also right that the controls on the pure are not especially intuitive but then since the advent of the touch screen, nothing that works by twisting dials and pushing buttons feels really very sensible.  It is easier to manage from your PC - set up Radio 4 and all the various favourite programmes you like to catch on listenagain in your favourites folder and then they automatically appear in your menu on the radio itself.   
Incidentally I rather like the pure connect app for Ipad and often end up listening like that.   
But my new toy, as of just yesterday, is a Sonos system throughout the house.  Sublime in all but one thing - you need a phone/tablet to control it.  Both young sons have had speakers placed in their rooms but I don't want to give them an internet browsing gadget to enable them to use it .. as they'd just spend hours on the internet/games instead.

Also no drop-off in speed at peak periods, which I understand to be a problem with cable.   
As for cost, I don't know how they stack up vs Cablecom, but if you take broadband, phone and TV as a package, Swisscom's package is CHF125 per month all up, including a set-top box with recording capability and free calls in CH. They had a ""4 months free"" offer recently, dunno if it's still on. If you have fibre optic lines, you can get 50,000 kBit/s broadband ... more expensive, though.

Quality is Ok but you will need a good internet connection in your bedroom and need to pay for the box.

There is SRF Player - app. and internet - which offers SRF 1 and 2 live. Whether this works abroad, I can't confirm, but possibly.   
I would imagine TSR and TSI have a similar function.     
EDIT: forget the above - I've just turned on my UK VPN and the live stream was not available. So, as suggested, you'll need to use a Swiss VPN, abroad.

			Hi, 
My son has an oldish Samsung phone - a GT something. After I got a new Samsung I worked out how to use the Kies system to transfer itunes to my phone. I cannot seem to do this to his.  
It keeps telling to use Dropspot, which I have tried, but just seem to be able to move photos not music.  
The Kies on my computer says that his phone cannot use Kies 2.0, although why it says this I don´t know because my computer has Kies 3.0   
Help! Please!! 
Many thanks in advance.

			Thanks for the heads-up. Got one of these at midnight, and was not thrilled. I think it's a robocall that is timed to ring just once and hang up - long enough for your cell to record the number making the call, but short enough that they don't get charged for it. I don't think it has anything to do with Orange. I don't have Orange and I almost never use my cell except to call my hubby. So I think it's random computer dialing.

			Have you looked into sending it back to amazon? We had faults with some of our kindles and Amazon sent out new ones straight away. 
Obviously if you stood on your kindle they won't give you a free one but if the fault was not caused my normal usage they're pretty good to deal with.

1569	22.09.2013, 13:13	Senior Member	Thanked 178 Times in 88 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    I had Cablecom in the past and paid for the whole package. I too thought the offering wasn't up to scratch so I cancelled their extras service. If you don't enjoy the service then just don't get it!   
With regards to paying 20 chf a month (I thought it was 30 but anyway, my flat mate organises bills payments), this is quite normal. It's called line rental, or the price for providing the basic service. If you were to cancel their digital tv/internet package you'd still have about 20 odd ""free"" channels. Often this fee is included in the charges for an apartment but not always. I believe Swisscom have a similar fee?       500 does seem a excessive if you are on the 86chf (+20chf) package.        I assume you rang up with your bills reference number querying exactly what each is for rather than a general I feel I'm paying too much rant when you rang them? If this doesn't (or didn't) get you anywhere then make photocopies of all your bills and send a registered letter to them asking for clarification.      While I've heard that netflix is great you'd still be stuck with the line rental and paying for an internet connection so at best you'd be cutting your bill from 86ch (+20) to 55 + 20 or along those lines. You could of course switch to swisscom but they are generally more expensive (though possibly a better customer service).   
Anyway you obviously have major problems with Cablecom so as you said it's time to find an alternative! All the best with your troubles!

OK, so you're moving here from Outer Mongolia. 
You'll find the iPhones sold in Outer Mongolia may not be the same as those sold in Europe. 
This means you may not get access to all the LTE frequency bands and may not be able to enjoy the maximum 4G bandwidths. 
This is one of the few limitations of the iPhone 5, there are a few different models made for different markets. 
(The iPhone 5S has less limitations, but is still made in different models for different markets)   
Otherwise, you can select any of the 3 existing Swiss mobile carriers and go and get a service from them. All offer iPhone compatible SIM cards, all offer pay-as-you-go and fixed-fee plans.    
Of course, you will need to ensure your phone is NOT SIM-locked. 
If it is currently SIM-locked to your current provider, call them and arrange for the unlocking before you depart from your current country. Depending on your current provider's policies, they may charge a fee to unlock.

			depends a bit on what your device is. some apps pre-fetch data e.g. pre-fetch links in a webpage so that if you click on a line, then the page is ready for you to read. and as others mentioned, some services scale up to use the extra data e.g. youtube has different quality settings and can increase if your connection supports it.

			Hi,    
sounds like your experience with Macbook Air is similar to mine with Windows, I just go into sleep mode and so it means it is very quick to start working again We are talking quite a short period of time. With Windows 8 and an SSD it is even faster.   
Apart from a Windows 8 tablet I have not used any other tablets which even come close to replacing a laptop for most of the tasks for which I use a computer. An ipad is ok if all you are doing is reading but as soon as you need to type or get any work done you really need to change to a laptop.   
Windows 8 is a lot better than people who have never used it are saying. I have a non touch laptop with it installed and a Windows 8 tablet and I am delighted with both of them.   
It seems Windows 8.1 (Blue) will come this year and it will allow you to boot directly to the Desktop mode and also the start button will reappear ...though it never went away...it was just replaced with the Windows key.   
If I had an Mac Book Air I think the first thing I would do is install Windows 8 on it.   
Have fun   
Martin

I just rang them up and informed them of the situation and they sent me a letter saying they had registered the second place as a holiday flat and that i was not liable for any further payment.

			You can also purchase the sticks from eg Digitec, and then you are not SIM-locked to any network. You can then fit a prepay card for whatever country you are in on the network of your choice.

2. Configure 
3. Surf

			I'm currently self trialling Wibi on the iMediaShare app. for iPad/iPhone, and signed up for a months sub. (7).   
I've been finding its use a bit 'delicate' -- fallouts; not recognising file format on restart, necessitating closing of app. and re-opening; film library not always fully loading or slow to load; after pausing, when play is resumed, it then falls out after a short time; always starts from beginning of film after fallouts and not the place where it fell out.   
All the above, aren't particularly a problem, but just a bit annoying; and although it doesn't have all the latest films, there are many I haven't seen, and several classics, that are always worth re-watching ........ and unlimited viewing for 7 for a month (or 60 for a year) is better value than other PPV options I've seen.   
Just curious if other users have experienced similar.

			So, 3 months ago when we got here we signed up for Cablecom's basic TV package.  Not a lot of channels, but that was ok because we don't watch tons of the boob tube.  Well, yesterday evening flipping around I realized we now have   channel!  After my initial pleasant surprise, (I mean what's not to like about having a million channels?  ) I started to get a little suspicious.  Yesterday just happened to be 1 September.  Coincidence?  Has Cabelcom taken it upon themselves to upgrade our service?  Or are they giving us a taste of what we   be watching, only to snatch it away in a few days? 
This ever happen to anybody else?  I certainly don't want the bill next month to be a  !

			Hi,   
can you please let us know what is the tablet OS you are using? is it Android or other?   
if it is Android, I think the only way is to remove the account and set it up again.   
Simply go the email app you are using then press the menu button then settings, you should see your account there. Now you need to remove the account by clicking on the trash icon at the top and add the account again with the new password.   
Hope this helps. 
p.s.1. do not worry about your emails, they will all be synchronized again. 
p.s.2. if you are not using the default Samsung email app, please let us know what app you are using

Thank you. I have no doubt though that infrastructure projects are cooperation between various companies, it only makes sense.    
As aside, you'd assume they compete for customers on price and and value. Though there's no real difference in price between the two when comparing similar packages. ie I've seen SIG/VTX offer a longer initial period at a discounted price, before charging the full price compared to Swisscom.

1. It's too much a PITA to use; and 
2. They don't think it is that important to have their emails private   
It's also not simply a case of being useful for criminals. Some people don't feel comfortable having their privacy violated, or being constantly surveilled.   
I find it akin to people who have their homes robbed. Some people can brush it off and deal with it. Others find the intrusion really bothers them and have difficulty feeling comfortable in their own home afterwards. (It was for this reason Groklaw closed).   
You are right that a determined attacker can break into your email. But then, a determined thief can break into your house. There's a window that he can smash, yet, people still lock their front doors, right? Why inconvenience yourself with using locks and keys when you have windows in your home?   
I think the debate is really about scale. I guess most would recognise the need to monitor certain people with the right protections/court orders. It takes on a different tone when everybody is treated as a criminal and the monitoring is done illegally.

			And after 2 weeks ...fault after fault, of course. Just why did I think that this one thing will work any better than the rest of the Swiss services I ordered. It's been 2 weeks since I set up the brand new Horizon HD Recorder box and I've been having the following issues: 
- remote freezing up - no response to any button pressed 
- internet coming and going 
- latest today: 60% of the TV channels not received - box works but it looks as if I had not subscribed to these TV channels (when clearly I did and I have been watching them up to this morning).   
Tried calling customer services - 10 minutes on the line without getting through to anyone so in the end submitted a complaint on their website. I am not expecting anyone will respond before middle of next week unless I spend most of time trying to call them.   
Perhaps I should have chosen Swisscom...hard to tell.

			This is 2 years on from the previous discussion/replies. I tried to look elsewhere on the forum but couldn't see anything.   
I have a Horizon HD Recorder media box. There does not seem to be an easy way to turn subtitles on or off while watching a specific programme. Simply no such button on the remote control and even if I press ""OK"" and go the ""Info"" it will only tell me what audio and subtitle options are available but there's nothing I can do to select them. The only thing I could find was the master setting in preferences on subtitles. What really puzzles me is that I had cablecom in my temporary apartment before moving here and the remote there allowed me to go to info and then simply turn subtitles on or off. I don't want to go to mediabox settings/preferences each time, it's simply ridiculous. I saw a few posts on upc software updates and new remotes but never anything on this subtitles topic. I think my box got the software update a few days ago (I don't know if I should notice any change by the way. I don't really see anything new...) and I think the new remotes will reach customers by September. I'm just hoping someone at UPC/Cablecom recognised this issue about subtitles. I never thought this was a UK only thing and am really surprised that here it is simply not there. There are some programmes I like to watch with subtitles on and some I like without .... I should have a choice to be able to activate them easily when I want (and when they are available, of course).

If you travel a lot and receive many calls in different countries, look at  .   
As a standard you have a British number on the SIM, but you can add a Swiss number (and some others)   for GBP 5 / year each.   
In Switzerland the card uses the Swisscom network, in Germany the Vodafone network. (Cannot yet tell about other countries).   
Incoming calls on all numbers (doesn´t matter which one) are free (Switzerland, USA, most of Western EU), cheap (Liechtenstein GBP 0.06) or affordable (0.19 for most of Eastern EU).   
In some countries, however, the service is damn-expensive, so it really matters on the mix of countries you need.   
If it suits your needs this card can slash a big chunk off your roaming charges!

Weak to no WiFi in my bedroom 
So I added a second WiFi access point, cabled over Gig-Lan cable to the Horizon box. 
Now I have full strength everywhere   
(2) WiFi devices will struggle to do more than about 25 Mbps 
My iPhone 4S will record about 20Mbps down, 10 Mbps up, when it has a strong WiFi signal. The best I've ever seen an iPhone do is about 26 Mbps. That's their limit. 
My PC will record somewhere around 100Mbps on a direct wired connection. My TV signal is not soo good, so I think I'm loosing some speed there.

			Hello, we have just bought a holiday apartment in Klosters and of course now need internet and tv in this place.  No need for a landline, however I know Cablecom and Sunrise normally include it anyway.   
I am wondering if anybody on this forum has Sunrise TV and Internet in Klosters and would be interested to hear of their experience, whether it be good or bad with Sunrise.  Is the internet fast enough, etc?  What about TV as I know it comes through the phone line rather than Cable like Cablecom.   
We have Cablecom TV, internet and phone in our home in Thalwil but Sunrise seems to be offering a better deal (price wise) thank Cablecom.  I know Cablecom would be alot faster with internet speeds but as I want the English channels it costs a bit more in the monthly subscription.   
Anyway, even if you don't have Sunrise in Klosters, I would be interested to hear about your experience with Sunrise.   
I am going with the Sunrise TV Start package as this one includes English channels, HD as well.   
Regards

			I don't know of any 'box' that properly handles 3rd party systems such as Zattoo: You would need a dedicated system with an optimised remote and channel selection.   
Both the Minix and the macmini solutions are a bit more techy and fall into the 'full computer' category that allows you to run aps, surf, email, skype, youtube, etc etc. And as such you do need a bluetooth keyboard with either a remote mouse or a trackpad (which I forgot to order...). I chose the minix as it is obscenely cheap, runs a vanilla Android 4.1, is small and doesn't use much power. My 7 year old can handle it iven if the Misses is strugling a little.

			Ah, that worked! Many thanks.   
Seems I had it set to Air mode instead of Cable, and when I put it on cable I couldn't auto scan so I had to change UPC to Others in the network type.   
Really cool that I can have different sound streams for some channels as well as most channels with subtitles    
Plus the quality of all the channels is so much better, HD looks great. I haven't tried the 2D to 3D conversion that my TV has but I suppose it should still look good.

			My mouth is agape with incredulity at every decision MS is making. They're basically stopping short of saying that they're giving up on those countries. You don't do something like that - go from originally leading release to handing Sony this holiday season on a silver platter - without having done a risk assessment and concluding that the 8 countries in question don't matter.

			I always see digitec recommended and I've used it before, so do check that option out.   
If you are buying something under CHF 300 maybe it could be worth getting it from Germany and deducting the VAT entirely.   
From my own experience, electronics are one of the few things that are actually cheaper in Switzerland... 
But I think one of the key reasons for that is that the VAT here is cheaper. If you buy it in Germany and it is under the limit, you could in theory recoup the VAT entirely.   
It may not make much of a difference though. I think Swiss VAT (MWSt) is 8% for electronics, where it would be 19%. So even if the difference for a CHF 300 item is just the 11% (it may not be), you would only be saving around CHF 33 for your added trouble.

			Thank you all for your advice, I missed the posts afterwards but did end up visiting PhotoVision as I really like the fact that their stock is all online. I was able to visit and have a look at the cameras too.   
In the end I settled for a G1X (!!) instead of a DSLR (which would have been a 450D) as I might be too busy to spend time working out how it works. I want to get used to this first, and they had one at a pretty good price. I examined it and the condition seemed pretty good/looked after so I'm happy.   
I paid 398 CHF for it and it included the SC-DC75 case if you might be curious    
I am pretty happy   I wanted to see it, speak to someone and not feel pressured to buy it so I don't mind going to a shop for it.   
And I agree with BaselPT - I wanted a used DSLR originally as it would be my first bit of kit and I wouldn't need to worry too much about something happening to my new toy.

			You will be just fine. No need for any VPN whatsoever.  
I am using ATV 3, bought in Singapore. I have used it in the Maldives, in Middle East, Germany and now here in Switzerland. Never faced any issues.   
I am using a US iTunes store account, mainly for the sake of listening to iTunes Radio now with iOS 7.    
If you are interested to watch UK, US contents from Netflix, Hulu Plus etc, I suggest using something like UnoTelly ( ). Which is less complicated and you just have to change the DNS in your ATV. Costs about $8 max.   
Hope this helps. Cheers

			My wife keeps getting bombarded by calls from Asia at all times of the day and night from ever changing numbers. 
I found an option on her phone menu to block all international calls (she has a nokia, simple model using Swisscom pre-paid). However, to activate this it requires a password - which is not her PIN or PUK number.   
I will go to swisscom at the weekend to see if they can override this as it will really improve our sleep quality.   
Anyone ever found this feature? Is there a default password? Perhaps it does not work for pre-paid?   
I know that she could always switch off her phone, but her sister in CH is ill and my wife wants to keep it on in case of emergencies.

A ""Aptio Setup utility"" is not the ""bios"".   
But in practice, you are incorrect: look the user manual, page ""A.4"": System Bios Settings: 
The illustration clearly indicate ""Aptio Setup Utility""... 
And on the same document, it says on page 33: "" To enter the system bios"", press F2...   
So it certainly seems to be the same, for that laptop.

			Seriously, thanks for your answers!   
However, if I may ask again - does anyone KNOW? As in ""Know for sure""?   
In case anyone needs the motif: I´m planning to install a GSM-VoiP gateway, which would allow me to make a call from Aldi to Aldi (hopefully free), where the 2nd connection would connect me via VoiP to the rest of the world.   
The call divert is needed for another set of motifs, which are harder to put into a paragraph.   
I need both call-divert to work (this excludes Lyca and Lebara), free (or flat rate) calls between two mobiles, and some sort of meaningful data packages.   
Aldi could be perfect, if I´d know the answer to my initial questions.   
Thanks and regards, 
Christian

			HI All,   
I just found this page that explains how to change your smart Samsung TV's internet settings so you can get the UK guide (if you have your TV connected to satellite) and also UK/US apps.   
Here is the link:    
once you get access to the submenu, you can change your regions to any country you chose.   
I just tried it on an F (2013) 8 series and it worked, I was able to get UK apps and as the tv is connected to Astra 28.2 freesat, I was also able to get the UK guide.   
Thought would share in case others are interested.   
have fun

			There you go click    
You can check the signal strength with the sky box it's a bit tedious as there is a lag in the update, but possible as I have done it with a webcam pointing at my TV in the living room whilst being in the attic of the house  It's easier and quicker with a signal strength meter.

			This is much easier than you might think, and can be done if you have access to a SE facing area to place the dish. 
Often you can pick up all you need in this site , if you search the for sale area there may even be some still available.   
No specialist setting up equipment is really needed. 
Have a go 
Follow the great thread by Mark and save a large amount of money.   
Worst case is , if you fail then you can pay someone to help set the gear up : and your gear will be at least 50% cheaper than you would have paid.

Are you paying for 25 MB/s (Megabytes/s) or 25 Mb/s (Megabits/s). 
Are you getting 4 MB/s or 4 Mbit/s ?   
Are you connected to the modem/router with an Ethernet cable or WiFi?  
If it's the latter - this is the most likely reason for poor transfer. 4MB/s over WiFi would in fact be a not so bad result for an average user and it depends a lot on your environment (interference with other networks, microwaves ;-) etc ) and the distance from the router.

The second one IMO is easier to do with proxies (but of course more difficult overall). You don't even need to access the victims client or router in order to prepare it. Victims voluntarily open the back door by using random proxies they know nothing about.

			Maybe you should take a second look at mobile Internet. 
Swisscom allows contracts with no minimum duration (2 months notice to cancel), the limit is 10GB monthly, and after it they reduce the speed but you don't pay more.    
And if at some point you urgently need higher speeds while you are throttled, you can buy an additional package of 1GB for 15 CHF.    
I hope you find some landline opton, but if not, well..... try this.

			I just dl'ed the app and I'm impressed with the speed and some of the features, especially the copy and paste.   
It seems to work really well if you know where you are going, but I'm wondering how well it will work when you are making up your route along the way.   
Is it possible to make it location aware ?   
I miss the  ""leaves in"" function the SBB app used to have. It looks like yours offers a similar capability.   
I don't care much for the name and some UI elements. I guess I am now officially a boring old fart.   
Still function over form, it seems to work quite well.

Other websites, including EF, the info is probably still there unless you remove before posting.

			You might as well pay 250Chf and get the phone repaired. It sounds ridiculous to pay but then if you had wanted to get screen repaired you would have ended up paying for it. So take it as an expensive repair.   
OR   
Get in touch with samsung and explain to them the issue. No luck then post the issue on their Facebook page. I have had friends raising issues on their facebook page and the concerned companies/persons immediately got in action. You have nothing to loose so give it a shot.   
Keeping the HTC phone that has been loaned to you by swisscom won't be a good idea. You will end up getting a hefty bill for that.

			The only way is to go to a magazine shop and look for yourself. You might find BBC TV channels listed in a sattelite TV magazine.    
I suppose she doesn't use Internet so she might as well buy a subscription      
The basic charge for the UPC-Cablecom cable & analogue channels, is about Fr 24 per month, which is include in the appartment rental Extra Charges.   
She then has to pay UPC_Cablecom a one off connection charge, about Fr 50 with a free set top box, and then there are only the monthly charges as shown on the offer.    
You might have to install the set top box for her..... it comes by post.

			If you turned your mobile OFF then you shouldn't be charged anything.     
The local network in the country you're visiting should know your phone is off and when someone calls you, the network in the country your mobile is registered in diverts straight to voicemail, not bouncing in and out of the country you're visiting.   
That's how it's always worked for me.      
You should only be charged if your phone rings and you divert it to voicemail (either manually or automatically after a timeout).

			I bought the internet everywhere key from Orange a few years ago. It was a disaster.    
First off the person in the shop didn't take time to make sure I knew how to set it up properly. The sim card needed to be inserted into the USB key. Myself, my dad, my brother (who works in IT) all failed to open the USB key. That may make us sound thick, but it really wasn't clear. I had to take it all back to the shop and get the salesperson to do it. And he struggled too.    
Then the connection was rubbish. I once spent fifteen minutes just trying to load up google.    
Finally, the default 'homepage' was the orange internet everywhere page. It needed a log in, with a username and password, which I should have been provided - but guess what, I hadn't been. I went back to the shop, they showed me what they claimed was the username and password. Didn't work. At first I could circumvent this by just entering in a new web address. Then for no reason this stopped working. So I would load up the internet everywhere page and it would just sit there and demand this username and password.    
I was then told I needed to insert the simcard from the USB key into my orange phone in order to get my username and password. One slight problem. I didn't have an orange phone (and no-one had informed me I had to have an orange phone to use this service). We tried it in another phone. It asked for a code. We entered in all the codes we found on the packaging. None of them worked.    
At this point I decided to give up. The connection speed had never been great anyway, the customer service was poor and I just couldn't be bothered with any more faffing around.    
Not worth it. Poor instructions, poor connection, poor customer service.

			After only about 6mths. my Digicard seems to have failed. 
Dozed off watching tele last night and awoke to a blank screen with a small rectangle showing the message "" ""   
After several resets and re-installs; checked TV and Cc. troubleshooting and a call with Cc. tech. support, the situation hasn't changed, so they're sending me a new Digicard - but only for Weds., as Mon.'s a holiday.   
Seems strange that it's failed in a relatively short time. Anyone else had similar problems, or am I just unlucky with a duff?   
Fortunately, I've found out that (at last) Zattoo is now available as a Sumsung app., as I don't have browser capabilities, so I don't even have to connect my lappy to the TV.

			I'm traveling to Switzerland for a few days to arrange some things for a future move and want to get a local SIM, as my roaming charges are astronomical. I've done a bit of research and it seems the best deal is this Sunrise Airbag thing, where you never pay for more than 3 mins for any call.    
Has anyone had any experiences with this or Sunrise in general?   
I'm arriving at Zuerich Airport and was thinking of going straight to the Sunrise shop to get a card, as I heard it takes at least a day to register. I can't really wait more than a day because I'll only be there for 3.5 days so waiting 2-3 days makes the whole exercise pointless.   
Has anyone registered a SIM that has been incredibly fast (recommended) or incredibly slow (not recommended)?

Your internet speed.  If you have a slower internet connection - especially upload - then you will then create a bottleneck situation.  Slow for the person downloading the gallery.

			Wireless range is about the wireless chipset installed on your cable router (white thompson, allegedly), and antennas.   
In any case, a decent wifi router costs between 50chf and 100chf new.

And here's the specs:

Bands:	Simultaneous 2.4 GHz and 5 Ghz 
Transmit/receive:	2 x 3 for 2.4 Ghz, 3 x 3 for 5 Ghz 
Antennas:	6 internal   
So you see it has the possibly to broadcast on 2 frequencies, and most importantly has separate transmit/receive and 6 internal antennas.   
Check the spec of your own router, I'll bet it's a poor chipset, poor antenna.   
If you want to go further, compare the actual chipset, but it's overkill...( )     
Anyway, with an ""old"" wifi router (7 years old), I still get very good coverage and speed. It has 6 internal antennas and also 2.4/5Ghz.     
Edit: Of course it also depends on your client, but you probably have any ""intel wireless receiver"", not much difference on the ""receiving side""-

			Thank you both for the reply.   
My dad has just rung to say he double-checked and he had a notification that his bill would be increasing from June two months ago. Like me, he has paperless billing and he said the letter was included in the PDF file before the bill, so you couldn't miss it.    
I've gone all the way back to last November and don't have anything of the sort. However on further inspection my internet speed increased at the same time as the price increased... so I can't complain really - I'll happily pay for better service. They just must have forgotten to include the letter with the PDF.   
Thanks for helping me clear that up.

However, once paired, the streaming works anywhere within Switzerland (I am at a friends house on their WiFi now watching SRF1 using Horizon TV on my iPhone)   
But go outside of Switzerland and the Horizon App says something like ""this content can only be viewed in Switzerland"". Probably because UPC is not licensed to stream their content globally. I tried in a hotel in Austria and I got that message.   
I wonder though if it would work in Netherlands, where UPC and their Horizon stuff is also present? 
I wonder if streaming of a channel in NL would be limited to only the international channels that are common to NL and CH? Like CNN. Or if you could see all your Swiss channels in NL? Like SRF1. 
Would be interesting to find out... who's going to NL soon?

			Fixed - I googled it and got this answer   
""Another way to resolve this is to go to ""Settings"" on your iphone, and then scroll down to ""iTunes & App Stores"". Click on the very top cell that says: ""Apple ID:..."" and then choose from the pop up ""View Apple ID"". It will prompt you to type in your password. When you type in the password that corresponds to your UK Apple ID and password, it will resolve everything. Hope this helps if nothing else has worked!""

			Hello All.....I just finished a very long call with Swissom Customer Service.  To make it short, he finally agreed to cancel this item from the invoice.  The new one will be issued.     
The thing is ... if the problem is from the Swisscom itself, they will fix it without charge.  And this is my case.  If I call them and ask them to help me install, then they will charge me which is fine.  But apparently my problem is the TV box itself and what he did was to replace it with a new one.  It's Swisscom problem so it is free.  The customer service was not sure either why this is charged to me.  It must be a mistake I guess when they book the items.     
Happy now.  I can save 80CHF.    "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Anyone ever had problem with Swisscom cable TV signal?	vbv09	Posts: 22

			Hi all,   
I've been thinking for a long time to renew my home cinema setup.   
At the moment I have a lot of obsolete material, only two available HDMI ports at the telly and still a lot of optical fibre devices connecting to my 5.1 decoder. Resuming: a big mess of cables, remote controls, and different signal types: HDMI, Composite, etc...   
My objective is to connect: 
all to a 7 year old 42"" FullHD TV (only two HDMI) and have surround audio. I feel that this TV can work a few more years.   
I've found several entry level AV receivers, and I've narrowed it down to the following model and speaker kit :   
I chose this one because it is already 7.2 (I intend only to use 5.1, but you never know the future), upscaling from non-HDMI sources and 6x HDMI ports, besides DLNA and Airplay.  Price wise, it seems quite attractive. Online reviews are mostly very positive, when when not very positive, they recommend very high end systems.   
Do you have any other suggestion on a better system for the same money? I'm also having a little bit of difficulty checking what are the best cables. That's the problem of ordering on-line - you don't see if they will fit nicely under the rug   and I'm afraid of buying some thick cables that will not fit nicely in my living room.   
Any comments?

			The Onyko TX-SR 605E supports the New 'HD-Audio' formats and is around 1000 chf   
We have connections with the Swiss distributer, so might be able to get you a good deal on one of these. Then you'll need some speakers (B&W   ).   
But I am guessing this is not in your budget?

			I picked one of these up the other day, primarily for Zattoo as I didn't want to change the region of my Smart TV and lose all my UK based streaming services. I have to say its pretty good, channel changes take a few seconds to re-stream and the picture starts off grainy before sharpening up. I'm using it over ethernet (through a Devolo powerline connector) not tried wifi. Its certainly not as good as Swisscom IPTV, but if you simply want to watch English TV in a spare bedroom then it gets the job done.

			I've had my Surface RT for a fortnight now and have to say I'm very impressed. Its a very nice piece of kit, as good as the iPad which is high praise indeed. When you see it in action you start to realise what the designers of Windows 8 have been trying to achieve with their much aligned desktop version...Windows 8 needs touch to really shine.   
What I love most about the Surface is of course MS Office, its as close to the full version as possible and has recently been upgraded from preview status. Together with the touch keyboard cover and mouse, it does feel like a very slick ultrabook. Youtube, Netflix etc.. look glorious on its 16:9 screen and most of the Apps I need are present e.g. Zinio, Pulse, Kayak, evernote, Netflix etc.. Some people say its better to get the intel based Surface Pro which runs full window 8, but I don't. The two are completely different, its like comparing a MacBook Air and an iPad. the RT is lighter, cheaper and has much better battery life than the Pro whilst offering the most equivalent experience. It sits in-between a laptop and a tablet.. its more like a tablet plus.

However these will come, thats for sure. And of the 120,000 apps already on the WP store, these aren't just going to fade into obsolescence but will be updated to work on WP8, thats the usual order of things. Looking at it another way, both Microsoft and Nokia are pumping a huge amount of money into getting WP off the ground, MS for one is making a loss on every phone sold. For the customer that means you're getting quite a lot for your money e.g. free navigation, traffic updates, all you can consume music, MS Office, leading edge hardware and regular updates/bug fixes... call them bribes or enticements, but whatever they make WP far more compelling than much of the same from Apple and Google.

			Hi all, I have a letter from Sil Lausanne saying that I have to pay 12 Chf for electricity plus 54 CHf for telereseau and citycable...but I do not have a TV and I do not watch TV at all, not even internet. Do you know what is this and how to avoid paying a service I do not use at all and have never contracted? Thank you, Maggie

			Hello! I'm wondering if anyone out there can help me. I've just got my sunrise router (fritzbox fon wlan) connected (the internet man came and connected it while I was at work this morning) I went to set it up on my laptop, and it asked me what annex I have. I can't find it written anywhere and on the help page it said either A or B for Switzerland.    
I debated guessing (50% chance of getting it right, eh?!) but I don't fancy trying to deal with it if I get it wrong. And I've real some bad reports of sunrise customer service. So I hope you don't mind, dear people, if I ask for your esteemed opinions first!    
I'm a bit of a technophobe, I don't even know what an annex is   Struggling a bit with this typing on the smartphone malarkey, so I'll leave it there!

			Hi all,   
We are moving home shortly and have been instructed by the owners that the provider for the house is GGA Maur, Im a bit concerned about this as we have been with cablecom for four years and even though they are not perfect they seem to have a better reputation than GGA Maur. Does anyone live in the vicinity of Egg/Esslingen that have cablecom? It is extremely important that our internet works well as my husband works from home quite a bit nowadays. 
Best wishes   
Darcy

Can anyone recommend a dealer/contact who's clued-up on all of this, allowing the Dummiest of Dummies to pop into the store and say ""Here's the cash, where's the kit?"" and walk home with all the nuts, bolts, LNBs, BBCs, ABCs, et cetera?

SF1 and SF2 are always unscrambled. If you are in German CH and your TV is showing the channels in original order after a normal digital scan, then you'll find SF1 ands SF2 on positions 1 and 2 respectively.

			I watch UK TV occasionally on Zattoo.  In the last week, every time that I watched it, it was almost unwatchable because of frequent buffering.  I don't see any other evidence that my internet connection got slow.  Is the paid Zattoo service any better than the free service?     
By the way I'm using Firefox on a Macbook.  (Thought about trying Chrome, I don't know if that might make a difference).

			I'm planning on getting the Sanyo PLV-Z3000 which has a decent review here   but most important to me, the cost/effectiveness of the projector is really quite good. It's not necessary the top machine but the picture quality is very good. You can find them online or pick-up from somewhere like Digitec   You can read the reviews at the Digitec site too. It's mostly positive stuff.    
Also, the depth of the machine isn't quite as thick as others and will fit on many bookshelves.

			What exactly are you looking for?! 
As mentioned QI is a great quizz, then the beeb has some really great series from Luther to Silent Witness, then theres the period dramas, or for comedy from PJ Wood house adaptations to Bluetone42. 
Not to mention the absolutely fantastically filmed remake 'The Lady Vanishes' and other one offs such as Dickens Great Expectations and The Mystery of Edwin Drood. 
Then all the wildlife documentaries, from frozen planet to blue planet, all world class, or perhaps you would like to learn something about science and space and watch the wonders of the Universe.  
Not to mention Top Gear, Ricky Gervis series Lifes short and of course the classic 'Office' 
And as for repeats, well unless you have seen every single old show, they will be new to you no? and besides, I can watch Black Adder and only fools and horse all day long and still enjoy them 
(and I actually enjoy the cooking shows  )   
As for advertisements on ITV, well yes, they have to make money, as it is a business, but they too do some good shows from Midsummer murders to Agatha Christie adaptations   
Yes there is crap too, but i dont see so many Swiss and German shows being so good they are either shown or adapted to other markets?   
You may not like the whole reality singing shows but a lot of the population all over the world, including Switzerland, do, hence everyone has some kind of idol/voice/talent show, as they do have cooking show too, once again adapted form the UK you have come dine with me.   
You really need to open your mind a little, broadcasters have to cater for everyone, hence its the easiest thing in the world to say its all crap, its not, its just not what YOU like, but wait long enough and soon they will produce a world class version of what you do want. 
You just cant have it every day all day.

I adjusted skew and it worked well for about a month or two but recently the signal has degraded further. That said I already have good lnbs (smart titanium I think) but I was recommended to try mti highlines which have amplification as you mention but haven't tried that yet and will probably wait until 2E is launched as they won't shift all channels immediately.

With the ipad it is clearly the easiest to consume content but for music and books there are tons of alternatives to itunes. Films and series I get over torrents so I don't know of official alternatives but I presume at least the films you buy are able to be transferred to a third device like with music bought on itunes. I'm not interested in magazines but is it not possible to buy the products offered on itunes directly from the publishers?   
Personally I've got the Nexus 7 and I'm very happy with it

			I'm not getting a new phone any time soon and am perfectly happy with my Galaxy S2 running on Cyanogenmod 10.1 (4.2.2), but if you had told me six months ago that after all manufacturers (HTC, Samsung, Sony) announced their flagship phones for this season that the one that I'd find the most interesting appealing would have been the Sony, I'd have called you crazy. The Xperia Z is an impressive piece of tech.   
Also, for those interested in mods, one of the main developers of Cyanogenmod is abandoning Samsung phones and moving on the Xperia Z, which is apparently very mod-friendly.

			I had the same problem aswell and I am with Yallo. I rang Vodafone in NZ and they said yes it was due to the change to Sybas which is supposedly the only company that can block spam texts reliably. So you can no longer send sms to Vodafone or 2degrees in NZ. I can receive texts from anyone but can only send them to Telecom mobiles.   
So yeah dont get Yallo or Lebara if you want to send sms to NZ

Tell them 100chf or nothing.   
BTW, you did have confirmation that the quotation was 100chf? Verbal is good enough but you need a name.   
Once I was also billed 250chf for the floor makers to ""move"" my cabinets out of the way. I thought it was free (included in the laminating job ordered by my landlord). They billed me but I refused to pay. I offered them 100chf and they accepted it.

			Hi All,   
I subscribed to a Cablecom Digi TV package last year, and have one of their Cisco 8685 digital video recorder boxes.  Running Cisco firmware, this box would be capable of streaming media from its Ethernet port on the back of the device, or via storage connected to its USB port.   
I am assuming Cablecom have disabled this functionality via firmware in their version of the Cisco box, but does anyone actually know?  I've dropped Cablecom Support the question too.   
Has anyone played with a 3rd party Cable aware DVR box?  Or know of any Swiss websites where they maybe playing with such things?   
Given the actual digital cable signal from Cablecom is now unencrypted, I wonder whether I can just reflash default Cisco firmware to my (OK, Cablecom's really I suppose...) hardware?   
I'm currently running an original Apple TV that I've put a cut down Linux and XBMC on, it would be nice to start integrating the Cablecom TV services    
Thanks, Richard

			Yes you need a German address to activate the SIM card, but this doesn't seem to be checked too rigorously.  It seems to just check that the address exists and matches the given postcode.   
Be aware that the plans (such as the month data plan) auto-renew every month, even if you do not have enough credit!  That is to say, if you forget to cancel your plan when you are not using the phone, you can run up a debt.  And if you have given a fake or friend's address, that's where things can become interesting.

Bloody google - type in Austrian plug socket, and it thinks you want pics of Aussie ones too. The pic was even next to the Austrian flag.   
Thought it was a bit weird a W. Euro country being so arse-about-face compared with it's neighbours.

Got something to start with when talking to Swisscom.   
Always find its best to have an idea of what you want / is available before venturing into their shop.

			I believe that you can workaround the limitation by syncing over the air with outlook.com or hotmail.com.   
You can install a connector on the local machine that will sync outlook (local client) to outlook.com or hotmail.com and then sync over the air to the phone.   
edit: 
guess I missed the point that syncing with a cable is required...Samsung via Kies can do this.

			Hello 
I have one of each in front of me right now and I can say the following:   
- If you like squarer laptops then Lenovo 
- If you like noisier laptops then Lenovo (and it's an i5 compared to the Dell i7) 
- If you have weaker eyesight then Lenovo - the Dell has smaller screen dimension and higher resolution - works well on Metro but in the desktop, it is testing...! 
- If you are looking at build quality, Dell is slightly better - this is because there is a little movement on the hinges of the Lenovo 
- Both have similar keyboards but the Dell has backlit keys 
- Both screens are lovely but the Dell has the full HD screen (1920x1080 versus 1600x900) 
- Both are around the same weight 
- Both have a lovely satin finish 
- Neither has built-in 3G   
You can't go wrong with either in my opinion but I'd choose the Dell ahead of the Lenovo (and actually just have).   
Please note that I'm fickle and once the Orange i7 is available, I might change my mind....!!

			Not sure if you're still considering a Kindle, but I use mine for research and, although I'm not able to flip pages as easily as I would a physical book, I am able to highlight, take notes, add thoughts, and bookmark pages.  It's all added into a file called either ""My Clippings"" or ""My Bookmarks"".  Click on that file, your notes for that particular book come up, click on the note you made -- or the passage you highlighted -- and the Kindle takes you to the page.  It's very cool and extremely easy to do.   
Just thought you'd like to know.   :^)

			Just do this reset     
Then try again.  If you run Facetime and switch the camera, does that work?  If not, and the camera app also doesn't see it, then go to an Apple store and let them sort it.  Likely to be a h/w fault.

			Most calls like this are scams, call-centers or something similar. The call-centre automatically dials random numbers and only if someone answers does it try to pass it on to one of the service agents. If no service agent is available, the system will hang-up on you (and this seems to happen about 90% of the time). 
In other words these are all junk phone calls any you aren't missing anything. If one day you actually have a human being on the line, speak to him/her in some made-up incomprehensible language. That gets rid of them fairly quickly.

			We have a similar problem - but with a Cable-Com modem and a Netgear Wi-fi router.   
Occasionally an iPOD Touch or MacBook won't connect until the router is reset.   
I once had a quick look for solutions and it appears it may be a Mac s/w issue but I didn't get any further as it wasn't that interesting.

			Sflowers,   
You can use a PC as ""bridge"" device as well, if it has two Ethernet adapters. Normally a wired one and a wireless.  You connect the PC to the VPN via the wired and then ""bridge"" the other Ethernet adapter (usually wireless) to it. All of your wireless devices connect to the PC just as they would a wireless router and the PC directs all their traffic over the VPN. Microsoft calls it ""Internet sharing"".    
Anyway, if that's too complicated, just use one of the DNS services instead.

I have the same setup as you, with a TV however (but no Duo plan). I used   and signed up for their DNS service (disclaimer: no interest, no ownership, no referral bonuses for me)to access netflix/hulu/amazon video/iplayer.   
It's great because for about 50-60$/year, I can access these US/UK services on my ps3/apple tv/mac + about 20$/month membership fees for netflix+hulu+amazon vod. So far I've had no performance issues, and they don't have a cap on bandwidth. Don't miss having regular TV channels whatsoever!!

			The end of the story (hopefully the end): caught a trojan horse, updated the defense :-) and as it was a genuine letter from cablecom, I followed the instructions on their website, filled in the form about the corrective actions taken and now waiting for the verdict.  
I am still amazed at the amount of letters in circulation in Switzerland. I wonder whether they will inform me about their OK by mail again. 
Many thanks to all advice given!

			Hi   
I have been using Red Telekom (prefix 10844) and Cablecom (house phoneline) for the last 5 years. It was working great most of the time. I use it mainly to call Asia (Singapore) from CH.   
Recently, I encountered many intermittent connections and even wrongful connections (meaning someone I don't know was connected to me) and then it gets even worse when calls are suddenly cut off or simply no connection at all.     
Does anyone else have this service and how's your experience recently?

Had a similar experience back in Dec/Jan - had to check sometghign on daughter's touch, as I was taking ito ut of the case it fell 50cm of so onto the dining table - frotn glass was then shattered.   
Not happy - that the touch is so 'delicate' (compared to an iphone, old ipod, or - was the best - an indestructible nano), and that I'd just damaged my daughter';s pride and joy.   
Was quite relieved that I   (we are in CH) had to pay 109 CHF for a replacement (brand new or refurb, don't care, but never want to touch my daughter's touch again!).

			I draw your attention to the last sentence of my above quote.      When you asked if it was your TV, it implied there might be a 'technical' settings problem.   
In general, TV listings are prepared a fair time in advance, and things change in the interim.   
Daytime programs tend to have less original language options as those aired in prime time.

			I've finally arrived in Zurich and one of the first things I did was purchase mobile service and opened a PostFinance account all at the Zurich Airport Center.   
Before leaving the US, I switched the device of my Verizon line from the iPhone 5 I'm using now to an old iPhone 4 that another family member will use. This was all done online via the Verizon website.   
After arriving in Zurich, I went to the Zurich Aiport center and first went into the Swisscom shop to discuss their prepaid plan with one of the associates. Unfortunately, they did not have a nanosim that the iPhone 5 needs but they told me to go to the Post Office branch just opposite of the Swisscom shop where I should be able to purchase the prepaid plan and obtain a nanosim (this was a surprise to me as I didn't know the Swiss Post also deals with cellphones/mobile devices). Unfortunately, the Post Office also did not have any nanosims but I decided to open a PostFinance account while I was there (rather painlessly considering I'm a US citizen).   
So I went into the shop for Orange (also in the Airport Center) and they did have a nanosim. I got Orange World PrePay as mentioned by EdIsidor. I inserted the nanosim, tapped on the unlock SIM prompt on my phone and entered the pin that appears after you scratch it off the nanosim holder. The Orange associate had to enter 'click' without the quotes as the APN for cellular data. Within moments, my iPhone 5 is working on the Orange network! The data network is at 3G speeds and I was told 4G should start launching this summer.   
Aside from greetings, I did all of my talking with the employees in English (hopefully overtime I'll have a better handle of the language) and they seemed very friendly.   
For the short time I've used the cell service so far, it seems fine outdoors in the city of Zurich. When going indoors in Migros or COOP, my service fluctuated between 2-bars to no service. It was sufficient for me to get some translations on some product descriptions I was reading. In my studio flat, the signal is a solid 5 bars.     
I have a US Verizon Wireless iPhone 5 (Verizon sells the A1429 CDMA model) purchased under a 2-year contract that's still active. The phone is already unlocked as mentioned by several reports on the web but I've also confirmed this with Verizon as they did not have to go through the typical unlock process that I had to do with other global phones. I bought Orange World PrePay service and had a nanosim provided to me. With a little help from the shop associate, my iPhone 5 is now successfully on the Orange network.   
Hope this helps some people out, especially those coming from Verizon with an iP5!

			For a light usage Lyca is the best bet. At least, for me it works cheaper then any add-ons from the same Lyca or Lebara os any day flat options from the likes of Sunrise, Orange or Coop. Lyca's pay as you go rate is 10 rappen a minute and considering it's based on Swisscom infrastructure it appears the best value around.   
 I need an email and occasional browsing and maps and I pay less than a fiver a month.

I know that the S2 is ""old"", but it seems that everyone is getting 4.1.2 on it..but me. 
Apparently even Kies says that I have the latest one (4.0.4).  
Anyone has successfully upgraded?   
Thanks

			Just an update:   
Several of you mentioned the Roberts radio, so I did a bit of browsing. I'm thinking of going with this one:       
It has a green on/off button which should be easy to spot, and a 'my favorite' station button -  a blessing since my friend only listens to one station, which I could pre-set for her.    
Do any of you have experience with this radio? Is it as 'elderly friendly' as I assume it to be?   
Again, thanks for all your help, everyone!

			I've just been gifted a baby iPad, and needed to set up some connections with Swisscom for a subbed app., but there were a few problems, so had to speak with a techie over the phone.   
With profuse apologies,they explained there was a huge update/upgrade/service of their systems going on (this was Sunday).   
Maybe it's all related.

			I lost my internet connection with Swisscom for about an hour this morning, it went off around 10:15 and came back short before midday. I rung the helpline and there was a recorded message. I ran later again and the message that the phone lines were overloaded.    
Anyone else have problems?

			Hello to all, 
We currently have Swisscom's Vivo Casa at home (=> unlimited free calls from home to the Swisscom network).   
All family members have cell phone abonnements with Swisscom - the kids have free calls within the Swisscom network. I am basically quite happy with my abonnement, but I am considering switching to M-Budget as I have no need to subsidize a phone purchase at this time. My phone is unlocked.   
The question is whether phone calls from home and/or from a Swisscom cell to a M-Budget number are free (i.e. treated as any regular Swisscom call)? I would think so as M-Budget uses the Swisscom network.    
According to the Swisscom hotline however, calls within the Swisscom network to a M-Budget number are paying. Of course, they prefer selling the more expensive Swisscom abonnements, so who knows....am not convinced.   
Who can confirm? Thanks for any input

My mum back in Dublin has two sky boxes we can have but now Im thinking of not bothering.  We're still in temporary accommodation in Basel but we're gettin the keys to our house in Reinach today.  We've decided to go ahead and get the swisscom vivo casa package.   
We paid a yearly subscription for a global vpn and use that for Netflix and then hook the iPad or laptop up to the tv.  What I am thinking of trying out is using the Irish vpn and my mum's sky account to see if I can stream sky sports via the laptop.  Tried it doing this with my husband's iPad but you need to download the sky tv app which wasnt possible as his itunes account is still set to Canada and you can't download the sky tv app unless you have an Irish or UK iTunes account I gather.    
To be honest it's only the sky sports the hubby really wants coz we're fine with the English channels you get through Swisscom.  I know you can get the football games through the German channels but my husband watched some of the Man U vs Real the other night in German and said it just wasn't the same.  Though if you ask me it might help him learn some German ;-)

			I've still 'only' got a HD ready tv. Bought it I think in 06 and it's still running fine. The only defect is that one pixel towards the side is dead but 90% of the time I never notice it.   
I do find the newer TVs have a better picture but considering the TV channels don't even broadcast in full HD and the ones I watch regularly ie all of the english channels on cablecom don't even have the HD option then I don't really feel the need to upgrade. I do think 3D is a gimmick but if one can at least use it then its fine but if there's no next to no content for it then I can understand their poor sales. Anyway I would prefer full HD over reduced resolution 3D.   
The only thing I really miss on my 'old' TV is lack of HDMI ports and no USB port. I've only got one HDMI port on the TV, I bought an adaptor for 3 but now I need 4

			Hi all,   
I just wanted to post my experience as a newbie to Switzerland regarding payment of random invoices so save (hopefully) others from making the same mistake I did! I know that anyone who's been here longer than I have will probably put their head in their hands and think UH-DUH but here goes...   
Late last year we received an invoice (in German) from Cablecom for 3 months worth of ""Service"". I thought this strange considering we have TV/Internet with Swisscom. After google translating (my German is terrible), and researching on EF (obviously not thoroughly enough, all I came across, was Yep, you need to pay it) I figured it was for the physical cable connection that we had to pay ""rent"" or an initial connection for, so I paid it.   
Last week, I received another invoice from them. So I did what I should have done the first time, and called them to ask what it was about. After explaining the situation (that we have Swisscom TV through our Internet connection), they agreed to cancel the invoice, no worries. Very friendly service, no problems at all.   
Although once it was discovered that I paid the first invoice, it seems I have inadvertently signed up for a 12 month contract with them. So no cancellation now. They offered us a great deal to switch over to them, including paying out our cancellation to Swisscom among other discounts etc, but they don't have CBeeBies, haha.   
So, through not understanding processes properly in Switzerland, and not investigating properly (which I completely agree is self induced), we now have to pay 12 months to Cablecom for a TV port we don't even use.   
MORAL OF THE STORY:    
1.Don't pay anything just because you think it must be OK (DUH  )   
2. If you are using another provider and accessing your TV through the internet connection, and not the TV port, they will cancel the invoice over the phone.   
So just incase another newbie gets the same sort of scenario and comes across this thread, I hope it helps   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Aug 2012	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	DON'T just pay Random Invoice for Service not requested	Amashie	Posts: 105

			There is a difference between a geek and a fanboy. A geek is some guy trying to reprogram his phone so it could trigger his toaster with some alarm in the morning... or crap like that. They typically do not like Apple products as they are designed to be not easily broken by idiots. Microsoft typically embraces those guys in order to sell them a recovery CD later on...   
A fanboy is some person prone to the marketing bullshit companies say. One that can get all excited about the new iPhone having a new power chord - or the camera moved for a centimeter to the middle! How cool is that! Not very much actually... that's why he qualifies as a fanboy.

			I was just reading about how unlike regular books, these online e-books are never your property. You only buy the right to read them and they still belong to the company you got them from. Seems this woman bought a new reader then found out she couldn't read all the books she had bought previously. I guess it's the same with all the music we buy. Anyway it was to prevent anyone selling their books online to others somehow. the court ruled that the books never belong to you in the end, even though you thought you bought them you didn't.

			Wondering the same thing. I recently saw that they enabled region switching for Xbox systems, so will probably bring the Xbox along when moving there in a month.       
But still wondering if there is any sort of Netflix equivalent available in Switzerland. I believe the Xbox Movies and Music apps should work, but I can't find a reliable list of 3rd party apps anywhere.       
Did you find out any more information since your last post?

			Hello, 
I am interested in the detail of the settings required to achieve this bridging. 
I have tried it and get stuck because (I guess!) multicast overflows all ports and Swisscom TV just freezes.   
Could you please provide some more explanations as too how to assign a fixed Ip to what whereand where and how to direct the traffic to a specific port.

I found it doesn't seem to recognise tunes as well as when I used the dial up one in the UK years ago. 
I hate it when you are showing someone how funky it is and it says not recognised, you have not been charged for this call. The new version that comes as an app doesn't seem to use dial up.

			Hey, good job on the website, it seems to work pretty well and shows a lot of useful information. 
Unless I am mistaken though, the calculation of one-off costs shown as a per month cost is confusing as although I am looking at a 24 month contract & tariff, the one-off cost has been divided by 12 months.  (If I am locked into a 24 month contract, and paying 240chf up front for the phone then i equate that to 10chf per month for the phone, right?)     
The next tweak you need is a way to extract the information on the random rebates that sunrise and orange offer online - 2x25chf with sunrise, vs 40 or 80chf with orange... all very confusing.

Invoking MS Livemail client for a similar exercise with the same account settings at least there is an error message ""The server cannot be found"" with details: I've tried with and without ""Secure(SSL). The port number was selected by the program.

			Hi there! 
i have a DENON RECEIVER which apparently has a transistor burned.  i have read to change this is relatively simple, but considering the original price (some years ago) i would prefer to have somebody skilled on these procedures manipulating my device. 
Do you know any shop in Basel able to do this by a reasonable price?   I have been told to go to FUST, but i am wondering about other options. 
thanks!

			If you did a lock and wipe then all the data of the iMac's HD has been erased, and the computer has been locked out with a firmware password.    
To unlock the Mac hold the ""alt"" key down as soon as you turn the mac on, enter your password when you're prompted to. You can then attach your backup disk (actually it might be better to have it attached before hand) and boot from it. When booted you can use the ""Time Machine"" option to restore the iMac to it's last backed up condition.   
If you don't have the firmware password then you'll need to take the iMac to an Apple service provider to unlock it if it's a relatively new iMac. If its an old model you can bypass the firmwhere password by removing just one of the RAM DIMMS and then performing a PRAM reset (hold down cmd, opt, P, R as soon as you've turned the mac on)   
If you don't have a backup of your data then you're unfortunately SOL, as the lock and wipe overwrites the HD with zero's   
Let's hope it's not as serious as that as you've not been entirely clear on exactly what you've done.

			I am a new arrival in Switzerland and have taken a tv/internet/tv package with KFN as they appear to be good value compared to other providers.  I am, however, struggling with the set top box, which includes a hard disk for recording but suffers badly from audio dropout on recorded programmes.  I have asked around, and other people have the same issue. What I am after is feedback on what make the box is; the box is pretty anonymous apart from Quicktime badging. I would, like to find some instructions and see if I can do anything about my problems, like use a usb hard drive if the internal one cannot keep up with the datastream and the internal buffer gets full.

			What a rip-off really. I just got their telephone service because it came with a combination deal and I wanted a faster internet connection.   
I used VOIP (SIP from netvoip) before that for years, and continue to do so. Their prices per minute are way cheaper than cablecom, and there's no connection fee.   
I programmed the phone to only use the ""fixed line"" (cablecom) when using free Swiss fixed-line calls, and to use netvoip for all other calls. It works well.

			These shock findings apparently stem from something called the Smarty Pants Young Love survey (no indication of numbers asked) which found that 'only' 67% of young people were planning to buy an Apple iPhone for their next upgrade, against 22% for the Samsung Galaxy.   
From this they conclude that young people are fleeing from Apple.   
Am I being overly cynical to suggest that whatever the result of this survey, the press release would have proclaimed that this is the end of Apple? It makes such a better headline than ""Two thirds of young people show a preference for the iPhone"", which appears to be the actual result.

Saturn sell the same model for  , but offer a   price guarantee.  If you find it cheaper, they'll price-match, plus refund 50% of the difference as cash, 50% as a Saturn voucher.   
So, as Saturn is 130 CHF more expensive, I should be able to buy this from Saturn for    (1099 CHF - 65 CHF)  get a Saturn 65 CHF voucher.     
This would be a cracking deal.   
Has anyone tried Saturn's price-matching offer ?     
One other thought.     
InterDiscount's offer doesn't say anywhere that it can't be combined with other offers/vouchers, so if you have one of their regular ""10% off anything"" vouchers, you might be able to buy the MacBook Air for 989.10 CHF  (if they   combine offers..)

			Hi Guys,   
My case isn't about multi sim phones    
Basically I have MVNO card (aldi) and want a new, simple phone, sunrise has some in very good prices but it hard / expensive to unlock them so I asked about above    
Interesting thing is that even on aldi mobile website address is.. sunrise  
I wonder if aldi is even a MVNO or just brand from sunrise...   
I guess I will need to test all this.   
Thanks! 
Jacek

			actually, i thought of that.. but lately, there has been a few such threads mentioning good deals at melectronics.ch or interdiscount.ch, etc. i searched for MediaMarkt and appended this deal at the end of the thread rather than creating a new one. Wasn't sure which forum to put it, though.. it is not a tv/telephone per se, it might be 'daily life', or somewhere around 'market place'... actually, maybe it would be nice to have a separate sub forum in the market place for such deals?

			HI - is anyone who is using vonage having problems with internet connectivity ? My vonage box and internet keeps going off and on and i am trying to figure out whether i need to assign a static IP address for the box and then screw around with the port forwarding. It seems rather complicated and cant understand why it is having problems - the vonage box has been all over the world with me (last stop Buenos aires for a year and a half) and connected to various routers with dynamic addressing, and no problems. 
Any ideas why there is a problem? 
thanks

Mine was ok, and still is. His was faulty. 
They said the same, that it has to be repaired. They did, but it was never right. Every now and then, it would switch off for no reason. He ended up buying a new one.   
So, my advice to you is, since you haven't paid, try to get a new one.

			I love my little netbook. 
It's got all the functionality of a laptop but the portability of a tablet.  
Tablets are great for apps and the web, but for making the last minute adjustments to your powerpoint presentation, or writing up that report I'd much rather use a real keyboard and mouse.   
OK, it's slower than my laptop, and doesn't have a DVD player inbuilt, but tablets have these problems too.   
Plus, I can use my pendrive in my netbook, which is a big no-no on my iPad.

In previous incarnations of Operating Systems the classic GUI has been a mouse and either a set of menu's or on screen ""shortcuts"" which launch applications.  Shortcuts, being visual representations of applications which are clicked on.  Here with Windows 8, the tiles that make the UI, are shortcuts which launch applications, yet are seemingly being dismissed as an appalling ill thought out design.  I don't follow the logic.  What is it about the Windows Tiles that is so undesirable ?

			Just sussed the   3D image on BBC HD, with my Samsung Smart TV ...... too late for the Olympics, but did catch the end of one program broadcast in 3D, this evening - hopefully there may be more over the holidays.   
On the main menu, select 'Picture' and scroll down to '3D'; (this was always unavailable, and I just assumed it was an app. only available to higher spec. models). However when a 3D program is being broadcast, it becomes active. Select it, then choose the image indicating side by side, and then OK.    
The side-by-side screen images then blend together as one big, blurry-edged one, becoming 3D, with the donning and activation of your stylish Samsung specs.

I went to Interdiscount XXL where Microsoft also had a small showcase. The Microsoft employee showing the OS seemed to be quite disappointed that they didn't get any tablets on time for the product demonstration. Microsoft had to retrofit some older Samsung slate PC to even be able to show windows 8 on a touchscreen. Needless to say - the much-hyped launch of Windows 8 was seriously botched by the total lack of available hardware. I'm guessing that was the hardware manufacturers' way of making Microsoft pay for the Surface. They're not taking kindly to Microsoft's own entry into the hardware business. Especially since absolutely nobody seems to care about any devices that don't  say ""Surface"" in bold print on them. Which is a tad unfair, considering the fact that the Vivo Tab and the Ativ are better devices in many respects.

The rented movies - that is exactly why I never rented them. The whole subtitle story annoys me terribly. I am big subtitle fan and use them even if I watch English, German or Italian movies that I understand, because it is just excellent for language knowledge finetuning (and you won't miss anything either). And it is always such a hassle with modern equipment - my PS3 cannot play same-name .srt or .sub files, my brand new Philips HD TV cannot do it either, I mean, what's up with all those hard of hearing?

			Certainly made me smile at least.  Honestly, you'd think they'd jump at the chance of having two separate subscriptions at the same address.  Firstly, it's more money for them over the extra +£10 a month they get for the Multi-Room package.  Secondly, it makes their subscriber numbers look better than they are.

			I have a TV, internet and mobile from Sunrise for the last 4 month and I am very happy so far. TV box and internet box (Fritzbox) are the top quality and has never given me any problem.  
Surise have a offer like 25Mb/s (20 goes for internet and 5 for TV) 
Internet works very well ( 4 people in my family use it) - the real download speed goes to around or more than 2MB . 
TV channels in different languages   
So, my personal opinion - go for it!!!

			The advice so far is good. To make it a little more clear, most people only need, or want, one router in their setup.  Swisscom is already providing one, and it is likely to be sufficient.   
So, just buy one or more additional switches and plug them into your router - whatever combination makes things easiest to wire.

Retail price for an off the shelf 2TB HD is around 100 - 130 for a standard desktop 3.5"" HD. Apple's price for what would be exactly the same HD at end user price is around 600 chufs.   
Oh, and since 2009 all iMacs require a drive from Apple for the computer to function normally. Stick an off the shelf drive in one of these iMacs and after 5 mins of use all the fans in the machine will run at full speed.    
Apple buys drives from Seagate, WD, and Hitachi/Toshiba, but all the 3.5"" drives have special firmware supposedly to supply the main board with temperature information in a manner that's more efficient than SMART, but in reality it's just seems to detect whether an Apple drive is present or not, and then make life uncomfortable for the user if it isn't an Apple drive. There are ways round this, but they generally involve shorting certain connections on the main board.   
Price gouging, there's an App le  for that.

			Could anyone explain me how the whole procedure works? I wrote UPC but they have no desire to answer me for some reason    
I want to order a Kombi-Angebot online (self-made, 50MB Int. + Comfort TV, because only there are some children channels).   
I move to the new apartment on 20.12, I leave one day later for Christmas and go back on 27/8th. I would like to make such an order, that there will be a package with hardware and everything else I need to make it work when I'm back(there is someone in the building to pick it up for me). Do they send everything in one package? With an agreement? Do I have to do something more?   
I ask because I heard only the worst regarding UPC Cablecom support, but in my new place there is no other choice :/

			Well I am really glad that I bought a nexus 7, there is nothing about the ipad mini that makes me regret the decision. Personally, I find Android to a better UI but that is a personal decision and I did have an ipad. I find the apps argument a bit weak...I cannot think of an app that is available for Apple that is not available on Android.   
The big problem I have with tablets is that as soon as I need to do anything productive I immediately reach for a laptop. I am hopeful that once the prices of Windows 8 pro tablets fall that they could be a very promising laptop replacement.   
The best statement I have seen so far about the Apple launch is:       
""Oh, and note our disclaimer.   
Along with a number of other European and UK journalists, Charles Arthur's travel and accommodation was paid by Apple.""   
Which really tells you a lot about the typical coverage of Apple events.   
Have fun

I also have another Swisscom line in the house in my name and two internet routers, one business and one family, it was mainly done for business purposes, years ago.

I am thinking of consolidation and adding Swisscom TV and probably saving money on the whole deal.

			As speculated it seems to make more sense to downgrade cablecom package from power-combi to top-deal, thus saving 25chfs and keeping a landline for EMS numbers/backup, and getting a switzernet number or two.   
Now I'm being hard of understanding exactly what permutations I can have with switzernet bearing in mind we want to use the service for home office/roaming use and calls to family.     
Happy to give my referral to the quickest comprehensive answer ;-)   
1. I assume you need one number for each concurrent call. Since its 2chf per month for the second number it seems to make sense to get two.. one for each of us (ie one business dedicated, handset or PC access and roaming on my iphone, one for my wife (ie family calls and roaming on her iphone)   
2. Bearing that in mind and fact we have a perfectly OK analogue dual handset. Does it make more sense to get the Linksys Adapter and/or the Gigaset Unit.  What is the most logical ""wiring diagram"" for all this.  PC, iPhonesx2, Cablecom line, and the 1 or 2 Switzernet numbers?

Their products are way more than 10% above the likes of digitec, so even with that particular rabatt, they're still overpriced

When a channel has an option for original language (obviously UK/US, and other Eng. speaking) to be selected, it is automatically done. This is for the majority (but not all) of English language programs on the Swiss 3 language networks, some French (Cartoon Network, TCM (F)), and very occasional DE and A.   
I have Cc. from Romandie, so predominately French options of multi-national channels. There are 4 Disney channels - one is French only, one is auto default from French to English, and 2 have to be manually changed from Dolby Digital (French) to Dolby Digital (English), each time they are selected.   
There will/may be some differences in the De. part of CH to here.

			The reviews I've read from iphone users on this aren't what you'd call 'glowing'.   
I've used Nokia maps or ovi maps or 'here' or 'whatever they were before that' for 3 years or thereabouts (in conjunction with a far superior but more out of date tomtom).   
The maps are so out of date (and yes as a nok user you get free, offline usable, updated ones) that it's not funny.   
A recent trip from ZH to Dover saw us routed via Germany with 1hr extra on the journey time. This didn't go down well at all.   
Like most things, apple will never be first, but when they figure it out, they'll do it better than anyone else.

			I was able to easily use streaming Netflix by downloading a simple program called Hotspot Shield. Fortunately I have a US credit card and address, so I was easily able to sign up for a Netflix account. But it worked flawlessly and I have been watching Netflix movies that last several days. Netflix has a 2 week trial period, so its risk free to try it out. The Hotspot Shield program is small and has no spyware/adware or anything like that.

			I see a lot of people looking for places where they can fix their broken iPhones/iPads/iThings in Switzerland for less, and unfortunately there are far too many people taking advantage of this locally.    
The thing with iDevice parts is that they're usually very cheap and they can be of very good quality if you get it from place at the right price. Pretty much all of the repair shops in Switzerland (and maaany other places aswell) provide their services at a significant markup, sometimes 5 or 10 times the price of the part itself. Although it can be justified by the fact that their time is expensive and that they need to pay bills, it's still overpriced in my opinion.    
On average, an iPhone 4 screen replacement job costs 100 CHF, with some going all the way up to 200 CHF and others being as low as 39 CHF. A cheap, low quality screen costs 18$, a high quality one costs 25-30$, and a completely original screen costs 55$, plus shipping. The level of how original the screen is is a very debatable subject. In my experience, the 25$ screens do the job just great, no one can tell the difference between the 'original' ones and the 25$ ones. However, the really cheap ones, a.k.a. the ones you will find on Ricardo/eBay for 'reasonable' prices, are quite fragile and of horrible quality. For example, I bought an iPhone 4S back cover from Ricardo for 21 CHF shipped, and the quality was just about the worst I've ever seen - the lens was plastic and scratched, and the glass wasn't stuck on properly. When I buy the same part from my supplier in China (for only 5$, mind you), the quality is like the original. It just stuns me to what extent some people are willing to go to make a little cash on some poor unexperienced people.    
Some repair places aren't even honest at all. I've had someone tell me a horror story where they payed just shy of 100 CHF to replace the glass on their kids' iPod touch, and they got it fixed, but the volume buttons stopped working after the repair. After getting confronted, they said it was his own fault. Not wanting to spend extra cash, he thought he'd fix it himself, and he bought the parts online. When opening the iPod, he broke the glass....    
Speaking of DIY repairs, here is my rule of thumb: if you don't tinker with electronics (either for fun or for work), don't do it. There are some exceptions, such as with super simple repairs (iPhone 4/4S battery cover replacement, battery replacement; iPhone 3G/3Gs screen replacement (if you have the entire screen, not just the glass, otherwise it's pretty challenging)), and if you're good with crafts or other DIY projects. However, DO NOT TRY TO REPLACE THE SCREEN ON YOUR iPAD... it will end in blood and a lot of wasted time + money, guaranteed (I have experience).    
If you're courageous enough, the best place to find instructions is on  . You're best of to buy parts on ebay within the EU, more specifically France or Germany (UK isn't that reliable for some reason). You also have to choose sellers based on their ratings (don't buy if they have a rep of under 99.6% or less than several hundred evaluations), not just the price. Don't forget the tools!   
Why am I writing about all of this? Well, it's because there are a lot of unknowing people getting seriously ripped off getting their iDevices repaired. Your best bet is to simply not break it  . I have my own repair side business, so I have plenty of experience with these things.    
It's kind of complicated, I know  , but feel free to contact me with any specific questions!

			Wouldn't say you 'scrooges' are sad as individuals, but the general mentality itself is. It helps keep an almost-free public resource and virtual civil right hostage to pay-wifi providers, greedy hoteliers, and worrisomely bigbrotheresque monitoring. (Some of the countries declaring the internet as a civil right have also been processing self-conflicted, long-winded law suits trying to decide whether a crime committed over an open network implicates the owner of the access point. The old adage about the postal system applies.)   
That said, I'm a sad one myself - despite strongly supporting open access in principle, in practice I haven't made the effort to find a sufficiently zero configuration, low cost, secure device to add as a second, open router. Anyone know of a router with some kind of light access confirmation and flexible bandwidth limiting?

Sorry it is in German.   Die  gesetzliche Garantie dauert ein Jahr, und zwar ab Lieferdatum. Für  bestimmte Marken oder Produkte gibt es auch längere Garantiezeiten. Doch  oft passiert das Umgekehrte: Es werden nur wenige Monate Garantie  gewährt. Deshalb lohnt es sich, beim Kauf nach der Garantiefrist zu  fragen und gegebenenfalls eine längere auszuhandeln. 
Auch wenn  die Garantiefrist ein Jahr beträgt, müssen Mängel rasch gerügt werden.  Das setzt voraus, dass man die Ware gleich nach Erhalt prüft. Unterlässt  man das, kann man Mängel, die von Anfang an bestanden haben, nicht mehr  geltend machen. 
Auch für versteckte Mängel gilt die vereinbarte  Garantie. Nur wenn der Verkäufer den Käufer absichtlich getäuscht hat,  kann ein Mangel auch nach der Garantiezeit noch geltend gemacht werden.  Der Käufer muss die absichtliche Täuschung aber beweisen.

You link states that putting a child under two in front of a TV is fine for a short while if you need to get on with a task such as cooking.  It assumes that you would more likely interact with your child at other times if you were an educated parent.   
However, it also says that doing it because you feel it's doing the child some good is not correct. 
And you did write:      Which suggests you think that your child is getting some benefit from it whilst the link you gave suggests that the only benefit is to you yourself - for a child that age.

			Hi guys,   
I want to get hold of an Asus Tranformer TF300, with a keyboard. 
All of the models in stores here, unsurprisingly, come with the German CH layout. I want to get hold of an American version, if possible without paying through the nose to get one sent here from the US.   
Does anyone know if there are shops that would source this kind of thing here? I asked in one, an Interdiscount, and was told no. I will ask the local Steg and Digitec shops too, just to cover my bases. My next option, I think, is to buy on EBay.de and have it sent to a colleague in Austria who will be visiting in December.   
Any info much appreciated!   
PS, yes, I'm aware that I can just set the keyboard to be whatever I want, but I'd like to see the keys as they really are.

			Personal favourite - Osmand for maps. Fully offline system, DL the maps ahead of time and it doesn't need any internet after that. The maps are generally good, though the routing isn't quite as good as google maps.   
For any other data needs when I'm out of the country I just use whatever wifi hotspots I can find and make sure my virus scanner is up to date.

			Might be a stupid question, and search did not help.    
I am looking at Naxoo Simply One Digicard. The instructions on Naxoo site indicate that the use is totally cable free - i.e. you simply plug the card in a compatible TV (TV still needs to be plugged in  to a electric socket of course  and there you go... i.e. no need to cable connection from the wall to the TV set.    
Is this possible? Does the card get signal remotely somehow, or Naxoo is misleading a big time here?

How can it be a monopoly when you can receive TV over at least 2 x free systems and 3 x pay systems? 
That's a choice of 5 different ways to get TV: 
Free terrestrial 
Free satellite 
Subscriber cable TV through your local cable co 
Subscriber TV through Sunrise 
Subscriber TV through Swisscom 
And even some subscriber TV on satellite (so that makes 6)   
Is that a monopoly?

			Hello TLUCASJR,   
I have a slingbox connected to Swisscom TV Plus (including the 5 Canal+ Channel).   
Unfortunately I have some issue when my TV his power on (HDMI error message) and as it's on my primary box, it may use by my family to watch TV. Upload his 1Mb (maximum at Swisscom  )   
If you want I'm willing to test a exchange, if I found it good I may ask Swisscom for a aditional receiver to avoid the issue of HDMI and usage.   
Let me know if you are interested.

			Hey All, 
I went for ICS on my own... Not ready for Jellybean just yet! 
All the Stock ROMs for GT P7300/P7310 are available on the below site.   
I went through a great tutorial available on below link to understand exactly what i was going to do. I recommend you do this as well. The link also provides all the necessary files in the toolkit.   
Initially, I flashed directly to US ICS version. However, this led to a problem. On locking the device and unlocking again, a garbled fuzzy display came up and it was impossible to work with the tablet. I have press the power button for a long time to restart the table. It worked till i locked the device again. 
Then I followed the instructions given by varun.c.jain and Castro to fix it 
The steps are listed below... 
 1. Flash with a stock US ROM (UELA3) using ODIN  -- My device got stuck in an endless reboot loop at this step. I just went on to the next step. 
 2. Wiping data/factory reset. I started my device once after this. The usual setup stuff like setting up the wifi and google account etc. 
 3. Flash with the ICS ROM (UELPB) using ODIN 
Seems to be working gr8 now. Thanks to all for the tips and suggestions.   
P.S. The reason I started a new thread was because I could not find the installation instructions from the old migros. Probably because they were were amongst the posts about the various deals. Maybe this thread can be used for all the upgrade related posts for this device.

This is the situation  the communication contracts here (Home phones and mobile)! They all have a rolling 12 month contract which has to be cancelled 3 months (plus a few days) in writing   of the next period!  Ask your provider.    
As already explained by leaving the country the contracts cease.    
Twice I have correctly cancelled a Sunrise mobile contract, and both times the service was switched off 10 days early! Difficult to fight them, but having no phone was a nasty revenge from them.    
I am seriously thinking of going the pre- pay route!

For our usage, a few calls a day and a bit of surfing, the plans without a monthly abo are definitely cheaper.    
We mostly call and SMS each other, and those calls are free with TalkTalk.

			No.  You don't need it - you simply navigate to a menu option under 'settings' and enable 'allow installation of non-market apps' - you can then 'sideload' any app whether homemade or found online.  I guess the equivalent of jailbreaking would be to 'root' the device, which allows total control over the OS, including 're-romming' etc.

			I doubt it.   
For the Swisscom fixnet contract, they also have the 2-month notice period, but if you can show that you left Switzerland beforehand, they should honor that, since you can't take the fixed line with you.   
But you can take the mobile phone with you (paying even more thanks to the roaming charges, so they don't have much incentive to cancel early.

Was interested in connecting the mini to my Samsung TV, but rapidly getting discouraged with hunting for a (reasonably priced) DVI to HDMI cable and trying to understand how I would get sound to the TV...   
I (too) think it's the graphics sub system which prevents Mountain Lion being installed (have not and will not attempt an install).   
Still no overriding factor - at this rate I'll toss a coin to decide!

			Hello Braincake,   
You can use VoIP service. I am subscribed to  , they provide Swiss phone number and i't possible to subscribe even from Germany (only prepaid contract), without any visa or passport.   
As most of VoIP companies, you can use the line from PC or IP phone... as well as on mobile. no matters how many devices do you want to have, you can do it with the same account and only one Swiss number. Also, they can guide you to configure your devices.   
I hope this will be useful, I'm using this service about a year and everything is works fine.   
Cheers, 
MK

			Do any of you get put on 'hold' whenever talking to Swisscom support about certain issues that they are hesitant to respond to? I have had many cases where I was put on hold after asking a very specific question, and then the call just timed out after a very long time. This happens almost every time whenever I ask them when they're going to fix my internet connection (they've had a ticket open since may, and just about everybody told me that the only way to fix my problem is to replace the line, but whenever I try to ask them about it, NOTHING happens). The representative just puts me on hold, and never comes back. Sometimes the call just ends after a few minutes, other times I just loose patience after 1/2 an hour. There have been a few cases where they did unhold me or whatever, but they're rare.

I am moving from Switzerland permanently and I called to see if I could cancel my Orange contract which expires in April 2014. They said I could but with a 500 CHF fee, or pay the remaining monthly fees, or transfer the plan to someone.    
They didn't really give me a break for leaving the country permanently.    
Hope it helps!

			1. When trying to find subtitles, try pages 777, 150 and 888 in that order.  I've put links to more complete lists of subtitle pages in  .   
2.  Subtitling on French channels is fairly common (particularly TV5), on Swiss channels occasional, and poor to non-existent on German channels.  If you can get hold of TV from the UK, subtitling is much more frequent and higher-quality.

			Hello everyone!   
I bought Final Cut Express like a year ago. I wanted to make a step more from the iMovie. But, as you all probably know; the difference is huge. I watched some tutorials on how to do certain things, but I got lost in all of that. I ran into some problems that I couldn't solve on my own...   
So, I need help.       does anyone here know (or can recommend me) someone who knows Final Cut Express and can explain me all the most important things?    
Please let me know. It doesn't have to be someone with a degree or any kind of diplomas. The only thing that matters is that you KNOW the program. I want someone who can come to my home & teach me for like 2 hours a day. (I had someone like this only for Logic program).

			No, I have got nothing. It seems like they don't want to tell us what 
this entone box can do. Entone, the company, seems to be just as bad.   
I recently asked the same provider (pluz alias arcade solutions) for 
full information on how to use my telephone setup and was told ""just 
call us and we'll do it for you!"" 
I told them I was travelling and didn't want to call Lucerne from 
Brisbane just to change something trivial, so they gave me the URL and pw to access my telephone setup (it's a VOIP system). Now I can reroute 
all my calls, listen to my voicemail (digital TAM) etc. from wherever 
I have got Internet access. So, why not give me all that from the 
start???   
It seems like they only give info when you put a pistol to their 
heads. I'm already thinking that I will not be a pluz customer for 
much longer as cablecom offers so much more for the money.   
Cheers

			Oh how frustrating!  I know how you feel, and sympathise.   
I had that problem a while back.  Called the firm that had installed the wireless thingies. 
Technician came and sat with my computer for half an hour, and then informed me my computer was old and I needed to buy a new one.   
That evening my grandson of 15 came round to have a look - clicked and clicked till he got into the depths of laptop, and found something that he ""un-clicked"" - hey presto - instant wireless connection restored!   
Seems there is a setting inside somewhere, to do with wireless setting, and it had been set to a specific whatever, when it should have been set to pick up the nearest wireless router?

			I wanted a game computer mainly to play a strategic interactive game and bought one from Prodimex.  It was installed by a person who was considered to be a professional but I have had problems with the 2 screens ever since. My professional tried to make them work, first he thought it was a connection problem, then it was alternatively a software problem or a hardware problem. The long and short of it is now only 1 screen works and very often it becomes black for a few seconds.   
Now what I am looking for is a REAL computer expert who will at least be able to find out whether it's a hardware or a software problem or whether the screen with the controls is faulty.   
Can you recommend somebody in the Geneva area who would be able to do that ?

Anyway there's no way to ""identify"" someone's mac address as you could do with an IP (well after the provider communicates who had the IP at X time).   
I guess your only way to identify who's what is to monitor their network traffic. But that's definitely illegal, actually, even ""entering"" the open wifi network is a private intrusion, illegal.

UPC has unveiled faster internet access for its consumer market, doubling its basic broadband speeds from today. 
New  customers are being offered 50Mb download speeds as an entry-level  package, up from 25Mb previously. The company is also offering 100Mb and  150Mb packages, eclipsing its previous top speed of 100Mb.   
Existing customers will be given the choice to upgrade to the higher  speed packages, at a typical cost of 3 per month for those on UPCs  broadband, TV and phone packages.   
UPC has invested more than 500 million in upgrading its network to  allow consumers get access to faster broadband. More than 500,000 homes  can access the services.   
UPC said it had identified a number of trends among consumers, with more  people using video and watching for longer, a trend that is expected to  grow in the coming years. 
Sales and marketing director Mark Coan  said the proliferation of devices such as tablets and smartphones was  driving the need for more bandwidth, and was behind UPCs decision to  increase the speeds on offer. Consumer bandwidth consumption is  exponential, Mr Coan said.    
The company also demonstrated what it said was the fastest internet  speeds in Ireland, recording downloads of more than 1.4 Gigabits per  second in a live demonstration using standard equipment. 
UPC's  announcement follows the publication of a broadband plan by the  Government, which outlined ""ambitious"" targets that included the  availability of 70-100Mbps broadband to at least 50 per cent of the  population within the Government's lifetime. It also said a further 20  per cent of the population should have access to 40Mbps, with a minimum  of 30Mbps available to all.       
Price-wise, Switzerland isn't any better.

a) The country is densly populated and has a lot of Swisscom exchanges, thus the distance between exchange and house is on average likely to be less of a concern   
b) Many households are cabled for cable TV, and almost every cable operator (of which there are more than 300) provide internet access over cable systems, and this can provide much higher speeds than DSL. eg: upc cablecom currently have 100 Mbps download as their fastest internet speed on their cable TV system   
So the majority of the population don't have issues with speed of internet access.

			Doesn't really matter where you buy. Always take the opportunity to at least open the box and have a quick look at the contents. I did that when ordering my TV and the delivery courier didn't mind. If there was a problem, I would not accept the package. If there's physical damage, it's very difficult to prove who actually caused it.   
On one other occasion, I ordered a sofa at Micasa. They brought the wrong color and when my wife noticed that on delivery. They apologized and offered to leave it at our place, for us to use, until they can bring the correct one. They also assembled (and then again disassembled it on pickup) completely free of charge.

In turn this has no impact on MPEG2/4 reception either, but that's a different story...

			Well that explains why I came back from work and can't see anything on the TV.  I'm staying at a hotel in Fribourg, and last night it was working fine.  Does that mean people will get a discount on their bilag????    
I also do agree with not putting all your eggs in one basket.  It's a cheaper deal at first, but once they got you, it is difficult to separate things and then they slowly increase rates on you.

			I have the Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Swisscom pre-paid natel easy liberty uno. It's a prepaid plan with published roaming rates. I do have enough money in the account (about 50CHF) when I was in Milan.       
As for the phone itself, there are no settings for voice roaming. It's all supposed to just work since it's a GSM phone that supports all frequencies.   
It may just be my bad luck. Oh well.  I'm going to Milan again this weekend and we'll see what happens.   
Thanks

You can fix the problem by putting the modem in bridge mode, and then using an external router - that's what I did, now everything is perfect, the Mac downloads xxGB files without a hiccup.

			I also have freesat and sky (without subscription) and the some of the channels in sky was not working, probably due to bad weather wecare recently experiencing.   
The freesat channels were working fine, it could be that your dish has moved or you're in a bad reception area where small change in weather would disrupt tv signals.

The video and audio cables are the same here as in the US: these days everything is HDMI   
Of course, you need to look at what connectors you have on your devices (Cinch, S-Video, Composite, HDMI, etc) and make sure the receiver you buy has enough inputs of enough flavours to make you happy.   
Of course, all your devices need to be able to run on Euro 220V, instead of USA 110V. Read the label on each device to see what it is happy with. 
And then you need a power plug adapter to fit the Swiss or Euro power points. See Interdiscount for such adapters.

			I believe such rules exist to potentially prevent a situation where someone buys dozens of prepaid cards in order to benefit from the initial welcome credit. I don't know specifically about M-budget, but some providers will do a promotional offer for chf 10 and the chip comes pre-loaded with chf 20 of credit.

2284	27.08.2012, 18:07	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	Location: Erlinsbach	"    Thanks but for me if piracy is stealing then technically so is using Netflix through a VPN. You can't walk out of a shop after paying 50% of the price here just because it's that price in the US.   
Hollywood lets Netflix stream their movies to the US for $8 a month. Hollywood doesn't let them do that here though. Here Hollywood expects us to get our digital movies from places like Cablecom which costs up to Fr9 per film! or Itunes where the number one film costs Fr6 upwards!    
Watching them through netflix takes away Hollywood's opportunity to rip us off which lowers their income and as you'd have already watched the series you won't be waiting a year either for them to come out here and you certainly won't be subscribing to teleclub or tuning into SF to watch them. This theoretically reduces the value of the programmes and income for these channels are reduced due to people having seem them earlier for a fraction of the costs.    
As I said I don't   to download for free but if Hollywood refuses to let us stream their stuff for the market rate they've set world wide, then I don't see why I should go out of my way to pay them for services they don't want to offer me

the below works for an iphone on the O2 network (UK), but i suspect that other networks do similar.   
if you have a locked iphone, it is now possible to get it unlocked so that you can use any SIM. it's free to do if you're on anything apart from a pay as you go tariff (PAYG unlock is 15 quid).   
you just need to go onto the O2 website and register your details to get it unlocked. takes up to 14 days. if you are in the middle of a contract, then you will, of course, still have to honour the remaining payments, but can still get it unlocked.   
once you're unlocked, you're good to go to use a Swiss prepaid SIM.

If you want a subscription, with Orange Me all the minutes include calls to any country in Europe, mobile or fixed line, which is quite convenient for calling home.

			Don't know. Swisscom is upgrading to fibre lines, too. If I get it right I already have fibre where I live - but not the Swisscom abo to use it. (Because they don't create specific abos just for some locations that could already use much faster connections.)   
Don't know about the situation where you live. But in general if you are lucky enough to have a local provider I would give it a chance. This 69 bucks deal is something I can only dream about in Zurich.

			Hi Kate again,   
I see that you really are living in Lausanne now. Please do write to CityCable or call them that you do not have a TV. But do you have internet ? Remember that CityCable has a TV+internet package and you cannot have either one of them. You have to pay for both eventhough you are using only the internet :-(. Atleast it was like that when I was in Lausanne and was with CityCable then.   
Cheers,

			German and French TV are mostly on the Astra 19 East satellite, UK is on a different satelliite at 28.2 east degrees. Both are called Astra, but they are located at different positions in the sky. For French you need a card and a box, see    but for German TV modst of the  standard German channels are free. Please note that some french satellite disches are pointing at 5 degrees west    so make sure you have a dish pointing at 19 degrees east.

			Venturello, 
  This might be the bad boy you are looking for. doesnt fit the exact schedule you are working to, but should do the trick for internet access for a few days.   
I too had been looking for such a thing for my cheeky wee visit to Zurich in October.         
""5 days unlimited mobile internet access."" 
"" 
CHF  36. / 5 days, 2 GB included 
Each additional day CHF 4.- (max. CHF 85.-/month). 
For a depot** of CHF 129.- you will get a mobile hotspot.""     
 Note that the device itself is limited to ""Up to five devices"" which i think is usual for Mifi devices of this ilk.   
you could always get 2 or 3 depending on how many clients you have ( on diff SSIDs I suspect so as to stop interference).  looks like you can pick from a number of places in Zurich.   
First post -

			Yep, it works. Took some time to get the Firmware over on the router through dd-wrt.com but got there eventually      
So, I pay for a VPN service (USD 49 per year) which gives me access to a number of countries such as NL, SE, UK (multiple connections), US (multiple connections), and SK and speeds which are more than acceptable.   
The setup on the router is pretty forward, but not knowing anything before I started I learned as I went along. A steep learning curve but great end product and worth the Saturday I spent.   
Only problem I have now, Is that me iDevices can't hook up to the router while my Mac does. Keeps trying to obtain an IP but just won't get one... I'll eventually get there...    
Highly recommended in deed...

			Hi!    
We are leaving our place in Switzerland to do some traveling and so cancelled our UPC Cablecom subscription (two months notice, as they require). I know some have had real problems with Cablecom Customer Service but we have had actually good service, we have been happy with them.    
Unexpectedly they called us back to ask why we were canceling. When they found out we were just temporarily away they offered to ""freeze"" the account rather than canceling it. If we remain customers we have to pay one-time 10 SFr for this freezing service. Then when we restart the service in 2013 we do not pay any start up cost and will also get 50% the cost of our package for the first 6 months! Sounds almost too good to be true. They said this offer is for certain customers... who knows about that but we were prepared to cancel outright and they called us.    
We have their 3for2 combination package. This is my first posting - I thought this might be helpful for others and to ask if any one else had this offer. Apologies if this is old news.

The whole idea with a ""blank"" box is that it can be used for whatever the user want to use it for and therefor there is no manufacture-ready-out-of the-box for your specific needs/wants. The DB does everything you want it to do, but you need to know how...    
Besides, your example with the Sky box is a bit in the grey zone as you are not supposed to use your paid subscription card in any other devices than the Sky supplied box... Why? Amongst many factors, TV channels pay large amounts of money being at a specific position on the EPG and the DB let's you decide yourself where you want channels placed and Secondly, the recorded programs on the Sky box are still encrypted so only viewable with a live Sky card. The DB saves programs as de-crypted...   
PS. Yes I know, there are lots of things you are not supposed to do with your Sky subscription card and I don't follow all of the T&C's but I don't ""steal"" TV and pay Sky what they are due and have doen so over the last 20+ years   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: May 2010	Groaned at 226 Times in 146 Posts	Dreambox	rob1	Posts: 6,138

			It sounds like you have gotten into a contract  , so basically you are paying off on the handset via your monthly subscription.    
How long do you have left of your contract?   
You have to pay what they are asking you, as you signed the contract and read the T&C's right?   
Yes, technically, they can block the phones IMEI number meaning it no longer can be used whichever sim card you put in it. Basically, it will be blacklisted on the GSM net.

			Some time ago I changed from Sunrise ADSL to Cablecom. At the changeover   switched off the service a few days earlier, and so I had no  Internet for a few days. A nice good bye present from Sunrise, n'est ce  pas?    
Today the Solothurn network   switched off the Internet 3 days  earlier. Happily after calling the new provider GV Weisenstein, they  were able to switch their service on earlier than the planned 15th August, and after an hour later we  had E-Mail again.    
This is in my opinion a deliberate small minded action by these two  service providers to punish their customer for leaving them.    
Well folks be warned!   and   are not to be  trusted. And twice I have cancelled a Sunrise Handy contract, and both  times the service was switched off 10 days early.

Anyway, things like being able to sync the 1password reader or downloading Navigon maps in the background while I answer e-mails in the foreground are just convenient and, really, are something that I expect from a smartphone. I'm sure the ex-Nokia-crowd-now-iPhone-pros don't need that, though.    
My quarrels are with Apple, not with their products. I've always liked the iPhone for its simplicity and its design, that's why I bought and tried out every iteration. Mostly, I sold them again after a few months because they're simply boring.  
Android, on the other hand, I used to find frustrating. It was messy, unpleasant, but powerful. Lately, this has changed, however. With ICS and now with Jelly Bean, Android actually is a pleasure to use. Battery life is awesome, the cameras (on some phones) are excellent, the apps look good, the UI looks good. The Galaxy Nexus is the first smartphone I've had for longer than half a year. I now use a Galaxy Nexus (didn't want to sell it when I got the SGS III because I wanted the latest Android versions) and an SGS III. Sold my iPhone 4S 10 days ago.    
I can really see why both IT pros and the general ex-Nokia-crowd likes the iPHone. The IT pro doesn't want any issues with his or her phone after having solved issues all day. That was the reason why I switched to Mac OS as well - at that time, Mac OS was trouble free, open and different. I'm now in the process of switching back, because I made some massive career changes and don't work in IT anymore - and because I need a working version of MS Office. Now I don't mind installing Windows updates on my home computer anymore - something that used to give me palpitations after having fixed Windows computers all day. The ex-Nokias love the iPhone because it offers only basic functunality in a solid way. Just like their old Nokias. They don't really need a smartphone - but SMS and MMS looks all bubbly on the iPhone.

			I've been using my Slingbox since I moved here in February - both on my Ipad and my Mac.    
To be honest, my biggest issues are when my satellite goes out at home in Houston due to weather. Occasionally, I just need someone to re-power the box back in the US.     
When I was in a temporary apartment here, I had problems about 7pm every night and I think that was due to the high volume of internet usage in my building. Now that I'm in my own apartment and have a direct cable line, I rarely have problems.    
Of course the quality is only so-so, but the fact that I can watch my US programming whenever I want makes the quality issue irrelevant. Of course, I haven't tried to watch college or pro-football yet, so talk to me in a month or so and we'll see how I feel then.

			The dictionary defines the meaning of unlimited - not some muppet in the phone company   
When these muppets come up with these lies, one of two things happens:   
a) all the other muppets copy them and it can't be stopped   
b) one of the other muppets takes legal action that honest people in the street can't afford   
In case (b), the legal action often results in the corrupt practice stopping, e.g.      
although usually only 6 months after the corrupt advertising campaign has run it's course.   
Notice the outcome: ""The ASA has ruled that Virgin must not repeat the claims. "" - nothing about actually forcing them to honor what they promised or let people out of their contracts.  No compensation.  Just ""Mr Muppet, please go home and think up some other corrupt advertising claim, but don't use this one again""

			Hi. Everyone. Greetings.   
So I need a smart phone. Since I will be here for a couple of years so I figure it should be good to go for the Abo option. (Samsung S3 on my mind) I would prefer a plan with cost less than 50 CHF / month.   
What I will do with the phone:   
1.   since I don't know many people here. And I also have a land phone.   
2.  : quite a lot of  texting   
3.  : normal user, which I guess 1G/month would be enough. I do not stream radio, music or videos often. Mainly Facebook, emails, skype, webpages, photos etc.   
So I checked with Swisscom for their Natel@Extra plan: It is for people under 26 and I am turning 26 soon. No other plans possible for this operator at my price range.   
So I can only go for Sunrise (MTV mobile next) or Orange. 
I have two questions that I hope someone can help me with.   
1. Sunrise or Orange? Surfing speed? Signal reception? Which is better?   
2. The plan of ""  seems a good match for my need. But it is in German. Can anyone confirm this for me please? Here is the link:         
Sorry for my poor English but 
Your comment is greatly appreciated  
Kay

You will however end up paying for a phone line (and the digital tv fees).

			One of things you've got to take into account on this forum is that, regarding ISPs, for every positive you'll hear a negative.   
Cablecom had a bad reputation a few years ago, but I've heard that's improved quite a bit.   
Swisscom don't offer the speeds that Cablecom do, but you're more likely to hit the advertised maximum than with Cablecom - in any event Cablecom is likely to be faster, unless your in an abused cell.   
Sunrise is the slowest of the lot, and for historical reasons I'm with them, but I can say that I hit the max download rate every time, which is not difficult as I've still only a 5Mbps link  . That said it's fine for my usage as I don't torrent often, or stream HD, not to mention they appear to have very little downtime.

2380	20.07.2012, 12:46	Junior Member	Thanked 8 Times in 4 Posts	Location: Lausanne	"    Welcome to CH and to the forum.   
I am not quite sure what you mean by a Flashcard, there are calling cards but these are a little old-fashioned now as people have very good international calling rates available from people like Lebara and Yahoo (and I am sure many others which you can search the Forum for). These simply fit into most mobile phones, but for calling within CH you will be better off probably going for someone like Orange or Swisscom etc. Obviously don't forget Skype too.   
In terms of Wi-Fi coverage, it all depends on the router, if you were worried at all about the one that comes with Swisscom's coverage and as all your kids sound like thy are in Mac heaven you might want to consider an Airport Extreme - though I am sure others on here can recommend an equally good (and cheaper) alternative. We live in a three-bedroom house and have a rather aged Airport Express router which will support Skype from a different floor.   
Hope this helps, and you maybe get some feedback from a Swisscom user in Lausanne.

			Cablecom had a very bad review on a program like bon entendeur a few years ago. They were slammed for their very bad customer service.  Looks like things have not changed! Having said that I find that Orange are pretty bad too, good customer service would seem to be a thing of the past.

			I've been doing regular data backups for nearly 15 years by now. First, it was CDs. I still have hundreds of them stashed away in various places (countries). Then, briefly, I used DVDs but it became a chore so I moved to external hard drives whene they dropped in price spectacularly. Now HDs are more expensive than they used to be 1 year ago but gradually going down again to the same levels as before the notorious Thai floods.   
Interestingly, Swiss HD prices apparently are one of the best. Even in Thailand itself or on Amazon UK they're more expensive. For example, I bought several portable 1TB WD Essentials for CHF99 here. Also, recently Melectronics had a similar offer for a 1TB Verbatim. Interdiscount had a 1.5TB LaCie for CHF149 and Manor had another 1.5TB LaCie for CHF150. These are all portable, i.e., not needing any power except for a sigle USB port.   
About USB ports, by the way. I had one expensive defective Asus laptop which declared support for USB3 but didn't actually implement it. So whenever I was plugging a USB3 drive into that supposedly USB3 port, it showed sympthoms similar to the ones described by the OP (Windows was recognizing new hardware but couldn't make it work). So it may well be a lack of drivers or a dying drive but could also be a USB3 issue.   
On the backup subject, I now only use external HDs since they're so affordable. I keep at least 2 copies in different places (countries) so I minimise chances of a fatal data loss. I did have 2 drives dying recently. One Buffalo (I think built on Toshiba drives) and the other Toshiba itself. Funnily, before that I thought of both brands as most reliable. I don't particularly, like WD (because they were second only to Maxtor in the league of most unreliable internal drives) but I have to admit their mobile dives didn't die yet. And one of them is like 5 years old now.   
Actually, I had 2 other victims on the HD arena - one desktop LaCie and one Seagate NAS drive. I don't use desktop drives anymore but I do have 2 NASes - primarily for accessibility rather than reliability.   
And yes, CDs aren't bullet-proof either. Some of those I burned 10 years ago are unreadable now.

They also were kind enough to suggest me that the mobilezone shop would do it for free and would also give micro sim adaptor (to put it in normal sim phones) for free as well. However, i actually got it cut at the sunrise counter in Saturn Basel and it works fine for my Nokia N9.

			I just changed from Swisscom to Orange yesterday.     
I was going to ask how to change the speed dial in the phone app, but just chanced upon the solution. Searched google, youtube and here for a bit and didnt find a direct answer, so in case anyone else wants to know:

			Do you need to enter a new password (network security key) for the new router, or re-enter the old one if that has been transferred to the new router?   
Click in the network strength icon in the bottom right taskbar and then on his router ""name"", under Wireless Network Connection, then ""Connect""   
And contrary to the above post, laptops don't take   to connect to wireless routers.   
EDIT: just re-read your OP, and it looks like you've already tried this, and are probably not running W7 (XP or Vista?), which is different as to what I've suggested.

			Hello I am new in the forum, i just have to make a decision regarding a chf 3,200 bill of data roaming while my blackberry data was off and data while roaming off also.    
I tried Ombudscom, but i have my doubts with them as being quite flexible in the allegation of Orange, they gave me a non requested ""will of gesture"" and alleged that i use a Iphone and not a Blackberry.   
I have decided among my husband and his entirely family to quit all the Orange Services and i will continue to encourage everyone, not that the others are better but it is abusive and nobody who can not afford a good lawyer will be able to get the correct charges.

			As jrspet is saying above (I think), it's likely (in fact, it's usual) that you have cable TV, supplied by your Gemeinde, included in your rent. If you don't want it, you have to have the outlet sealed (physically) by someone from the Gemeinde, and you will then get a reduction in your rent. However, you're usually charged a fee (of course) to seal the cable TV outlet ....   
It's very unlikely that your TV licence fee (""Billag"") is included in your rent. You need to pay this directly to Billag.   
I can't help on the question about internet connection -- but that figure of CHF 40 sounds about right.   
Enjoy your new apartment!

Just launch, pick the channel you want (all uk terrestrial channels are there, sit through the ad and then watch). You can also record what you want to watch which will be held for 30 days on a free account and 90 days on a paid account. With a paid account you can also have 90 days of recording, without the ads, and you can get the video in HD.   
No messing with VPNs, no fuss, just start the program and go.   
Of course if there are specific things that iPlayer does that Zattoo doesn't and you want them, then it's VPN I'm afraid.   
Ok, I've just started Zattoo on my iPad, logged in and it seems to work brilliantly.   
Edit: the reason that Apple London told you it was impossible is that the person you spoke to is either doesn't know it's possible, or has to take the company line and tell you it's impossible.

the more I think about it the more I really don't understand why anyone said take it to apple, and why the op would actually do that??   
when you find (or lose) something you don't go back to the manufacturer and ask them if they have it / want it, people really are taking the cult of apple way too far

			Hi, I have a Satellite pointing at Hotbird 13east, I pick up all the usual SF1 SFZwei etc with the viaccess card. However, I'm looking at getting Al Jazeera Sports or JSC sports as they are also known. You can get EPL matched replayed (not live), npower championship live, Bundesliga live, La Liga Live, Dutch League live, Serie A live and also Swiss Super league live. As well as FA cup and league cup. 
I have looked on eBay uk and a viaccess card for channels 1 to 8 is £90 sterling, and with 1-10 and espn it's £160. 
My questions are: 
Has anyone got this? 
Are the matches also in English? 
Is it worth getting the extra channels 9 & 10?   
Thanks for any help.

			I also rent the digital set-top box for Fr 6 per month and am now thinking to change to the set-top box which also recordscosting Fr 20 per month. Disadvantages include a) rapidly accruing rental costs (Fr 240.-- per year!) even if the first six months is at half price; b) no possibility to transfer recorded movies or documentaries to PC for archiving, cutting, editing, etc.    
I wonder whether one could buy an HD PVR from Philips, Samsung, etc and be able to use it without the hardware from Cablecom. Would this be a possibility?

			I would love to have Tivo here. The state of DVR software is really sad. I had a ReplayTV in the US, which was a precursor to Tivo. It was developed in the late 90's and the software was amazing compared to the junk out there now.   
It could record any show that matched a keyword search, for any word in the description, actor, etc. Just the fact that people respond with ""wow"" to that nowadays shows how bad it is.   
I would be interested to hear if others have found a good solution, such as the open source linux box solutions (Myth TV), Dreambox, or otherwise. Do they work with the full channel set from Cablecom or Swisscom or are there issues with encrypted channels, etc?   
I just got my UPC Cablecom box and I was hoping things had gotten better. They haven't.

If you are wanting to just have the standard analogue tv through cable, then maybe. I know Sony have different models for the UK without integrated cable tv decoders, but others like Toshiba have a standard model across Europe.    
Having said that almost everyone I know has either a cablecom/swisscom set top box, or have installed sky. For all of these you will have a set top box which you connect to the TV, so lack of the integrated European cable decoder in the TV is not an issue.    
So you should be fine to bring it over.

			I agree with Nil on Vonage.  I have had a Vonage number since moving to Switzerland from the US, and I have been highly satisfied with it.   
In order to obtain the Vonage phone, I simply called Vonage (info at  ) when I would have normally called the local landline phone company to arrange for line disconnection when I moved out of my home in the US.  I was able to keep my old landline number.  I paid for the equipment from Vonage, received it via mail, and all was set. I would encourage you to make sure your bandwidth speed is high enough in order to assure quality performance.    
The only downside is the occasional call from a local or state politician during elections season, which usually comes in around midnight or 1 a.m. here in Switzerland.      
Incidentally, you can also have a pretty good time telling a US sales caller that you are interested in carpet cleaning or an alarm system, giving them a four-digit postal code and seeing what they say.

			The Switzernet prepaid accounts do actually have a monthly fee, and don't give free calls to any international land lines, so they can work out really expensive. Their 9chf monthly charge will buy you an hour of calls to Swiss mobiles on Voipcheap. Quite a head start! Plus you can spread that hour over 3 months, still getting free international calls all the while and no contract.   
The Gigaset 610ip I have is a newer version of the phone Switzernet are promoting (see Marie_89's post). It is a little more expensive around 95chf. I have been using voipcheap since 2005. Call quality has been excellent. I also have a SIP client on my iphone, and often dial out on that if I am within range of any good wlan connection, say at friends etc.    
The Gigaset 610ip lets you plug in a land line as well as the net cable, and the stylish handset will answer calls from either the land line or any of your internet phones. Outgoing calls can be programmed to use any internet account or land line based on dialed number. It also displays the callers name for incoming calls if they are listed in the Swiss telephone book!

			They post out the equipment to you which (in my case) arrived before my ""live"" date. If however work needs to be done to install a cable or even to activate a dormant cable you would need to harass them a bit or organise an engineer/electrician yourself (though when we did it we weren't charged for the engineer).

			There are 3 physical mobile networks in Switzerland, Swisscom, Sunrise and Orange.    
The ""Mobile Country Code"", or MCC for Switzerland is 228. All 3 Swiss operators have this. The ""Mobile Network Code"", or MNC, is a unique number inside of the country.   
Here's the 3 for Switerland:   Operator---MCC---MNC  Swisscom 228 01 Sunrise 228 02 Orange 228 03     If you can put your phone into some kind of ""field-test"" mode, you can usually see this info, otherwise you need an app installed. For Android phones, you can download ""Cellumap""  from the Android Market (free). There's probably something similar for iPhone as well.   
Here's a screenshot from Cellumap, you can see from the MCC-MNC of 228-01 that this phone is on the Swisscom network. You can also see the operator name. But if this phone was for example on M-Budget, it may show the name as ""M-Budget Mobile"", because that's what's read from the SIM card, but the MCC-MNC is taken from the radio, and that would still show 228-01 because M-Budget is a MVNO (""Virtual Operator"") using the Swisscom physical network.       
Respectively, Coop-Mobile should show MCC-MNC 228-03 because they are using the Orange network. Aldi Mobile and Lebara should show 228-02 because they are using the Sunrise network.   
*edit*   
oops, you are trying to find out what network   number is on. Oh, what i wrote is valid for your phone, mainly for people using MVNO's (like Coop Mobile).

Excellent news - and just in time for the next iPhone :-)    
I believe this clearly shows the anti-trust commission's decision to ban the merger between Orange and Sunrise was the right one. Both Sunrise and Orange have recently stepped up their game. With the introduction of another EDGE network (which won't be taking very long - Orange France and O2 UK built their EDGE capability in less than a year as this doesn't require new antennas), there will be three capable contenders in the Swiss market.    
With Swisscom's recent network-overload problems and Sunrise's massive gain in market share (they're up 3% in the last quarter), things are finally looking better for the customers.

			As I most likely will be in Obersaxen in the weekends during the upcoming football European championship I am looking for a bar/restaurant/café where they will show the matches on TV.   
Anyone with local knowledge?   
The internet in my apartment is unfortunately not fast enough to provide a decent quality of online TV :thumbdown:   
I have seen on the Interweb that the UBS Arena had public viewing before, but I cannot find any information about this year.   
Please let me know if you know anything about this too.

I noticed with Cablecom it is not consistent in asking you whether you want to series record when selecting record on something that is evidently a series.   
My friend said the same to me, that he cant do it anymore.   
But you can go into the TV guide menu and do it from there as opposed to accepting the prompt is sporadically gives, I am sure. I will report back tonight when I have checked.

			So today I went to ask the citycable. It turns out that one has to have a digital TV in order to receive Pro7, BBC etc. He gave me a list of channels which could be received analoguely and/or digitally. THe Pro7 is in the digital group only..   
So I was told that I have two options, either get a new digital TV (which is rather pricey for me at the moment) or get a ""digital adapter device"" for my analogue TV. Does anyone know anything about such digital adapter device? What is the technical name actually and where could I get it cheaply?    
Thanks.

			Last week I decided finally to take up an Orange offer where they take off CHF per month off my bill for re-signing for 12 months.  This was done online.   
Unfortunately since then (i.e. in last 7 days) my phone has started to 'die', and although not giving up on the damned thing I have doubts it'll make it to the end of next month let alone next year.   
For a phone contract that I extended online, do I have any EU-style retraction rights? (my bill date is 4th of the month BTW).  Acording to the client section on orange.ch, the sign-up was successful, but I can't find any sign of the contract.   
A quick search here did not reveal any questions similar to mine.

			And they are available from today (online). 
I had Sunrise sunflat 2 sim only and I was paying 45 chf. The new Sunrise flat 2 also costs 45 chf but it has unlimited sms/mms included now. Not bad! I went to mein konto and I made the change online. A confirmation sms came in 5 minutes and the change is valid from tomorrow. 
 The only difference is that if you have sunrise sunflat 2 for 65 chf (that is you purchased also a phone with you abo) the new sunrise flat 2 would be 70 chf. But to pay 5 chf extra for unlimited sms/mms...I would say it is a good deal if you text a lot.

			Hello  all, sorry first post might be another ""problem"" with the swiss way of doing things, but im fresh out of options.   
I moved to a new house in Lausanne last year in Aug after living in a small town outside Lausanne.  
i run a busy company both here in switzerland and Denmark and as an owner i run through all invoices and pay them.  After about 8 to 9 month i by accident actually looked at my invoice from the energy company and see that in between the lines they have added something called ""multimedia "". 
i does not say what it is or what its for , so since im a paying client with Swisscom and has been happily since i arrived i called up Romande who told me outright that since i paid the first invoice it was considered that i had agreed to this service. it seems that its a  broadban for internet and tv ( i use swisscom bluewintv and pay for this along side used to use cablecom for tv ) i told them that i had never been asked or even told that this existed ( not by a salesperson, letter, notifications or anything  by them, the company i rent the house from or the owner of the house, but they did not care.  I then got really upset since in my world this is borderline fraud. they promised they would get back to me. 
now almost 3 months later i still have not heard anything from them except for the regular invoices which i of course want to pay, but by doing so im actaully paying for the ""multimedia"" and thereby accepting the fraud. they are only writting me in French despite i have told them via phone and emails on 5 occations i only speak English and German.   
anyone else in this forum who has encountered this problem before and got it solved ?  Also  im suspecting they are just trying to get some free money from all foreigners whos companies pay their bills this way and therefor most often does not question this.  All my nabours who are swiss french and people i work with who are also swiss are totally agreeing with me here, but its like ramming your head against a concrete block to get theese people to admit fraud, cheating and other nasty tricks.   
i would be greatfull for any advise and input.   
AND yes i could have gone through the first invoice when i received it but paying around 50 to 60 invoices per week made me just naivly think that the power company would only charge me for electricty and nothing else. 
ask yourself how many of you who will go through your reciept from COOP each time you shop in the weekend, and if you did not and they charged you 40 CHF for sunshine in Switzerland and would do so in the future  just because you paid it the first time  and didnt complain

			You could also try   it requires Windows 7, but it will basically turn your PC into a hotspot allowing to connect your xbox or other device to the internet ... it's also free.   
Great also if you are in a hotel and have to pay for wifi, as you can share it with others whilst only paying once  .... a word of warning occasionally depending on the what firewall you are using to allow connectify to use a couple of ports.

			Well the recording box would be off limits (I had barely trained my parents to use the VHS when it died), and as how quickly one changes channels... well not much of a problem there. 
I see your points, but for my problem the card would still be the best option: the box would have an extra remote (right?) and that would probably prove a dealbreaker by my mom. What? Another thing on the coffee table? NO WAY.   "	null	null	null	Cablecom DigiCard with an old(-er) TV	guest	null

			On a trip to England last year I bought a pay and go mobile phone in Tesco which has since stopped working.   
Tesco provide a warranty for a year on such goods but I have no plans to return to the UK before this expires.   
The only option left for me would be to post the phone in its box back to England. However, I am sure this will be intercepted by customs and duty will have to be paid.   
Does anyone know how I can mail the phone with an exemption from customs duty?   
Many thanks!

This interesting   from Pearl.ch can do more than this, including beaming your desktop to TV wirelessly or so the google translation tells me. Might be the solution for caviarchips' problem.

A new bar/restaurant has opened near to the University on the corner of Via Ponte Madonetta and via Ciani.

			Don't pay to 'break' the contract. But inform yourself what the conditions (duration) are in order to resign from the contract. I have read a few months ago, that Swisscom changed their conditions: so now, it is possible to resign from Swisscom mobile phone abonnements within 2 months since you gave notice.

In fact, if you source a HD+ box separately you don't need a new card at all, you can just get them to register the existing one for the Sky+ services... which you already have, so possibly you wouldn't even need to do that.   
Oh, and you don't _need_ to pay an increased subscription - many channels (i.e. the normally free ones, BBC, CH4 etc.) are available on their HD broadcasts without a new subscription.   
TBH though, I'm not that fussed about HD. I found that the biggest improvement in quality that came with the HD box was found by sing the HDMI interface instead of Scart. Even on non-HD channels the difference in picture quality was astonishing.

			Handwriting was not bad (using the Notability app). But I expect the Adonit Jot Pro to be better (luckily some sense came to me so I did not go to buy that one yesterday).    
I loaded a couple of freebie sketching apps (the Autodesk one, the Bamboo one, Paper - funny enough, no Adobe Ideas in the CH store which I don't understand at all) but to be honest I have trouble drawing the proverbial straight line.   
The OH is an illustrator by trade, and has a Wacom slate that is used for some (smaller percentage) of work. I'll report back once I've got her to test a bit.   
BTW I think I'll try the Amazon link, 'too' cheap not to try (and compare).  Just have to organise that someone going ot the UK or get my mother to send out here...

			Hello,   
I have a question about activating a Cablecom homepage, it's not strictly related to FTP but hopefully this is an appropriate thread! Of course, I have tried to call Cablecom but my French is not quite up to explaining the problem & I'm still waiting for a call back from someone who speaks English.   
I want to use my Cablecom personal homepage, which I believe would be found at:    (using ""myname"" as an example)   
I have successfully registered   at registration.hispeed.ch.   
I created my page (index.html) & apparently successfully uploaded it, using FTP to  , loging in as  . This all worked smoothly & I can see it if I do a folder listing on the server.   
However, when I try to access  http://homepage.hispeed.ch/myname/index.html    
I just get 404 (page not found) error...    
Both   & homepage.hispeed.ch resolve to the same IP address (80.109.240.78)   
Does anyone know if there is an additional, undocumented step that is needed to get this to work?   
Thanks :-)

			Try the Orange (UK) european traveller which allows you to recive 1000 mins free calls, but you will need to subscribe it for £10 pcm. Not sure if this will also be applicable to a pay and go SIM tho. It is good deal if you really have many calls to your UK number.

Although this part would cost very little, you cannot buy it, and it is not in Sky's interests to make it available. 
Anyone who has bought a working, second-hand, Sky box has been fortunate.

I'm in the middle of a 1 year contract with Orange, and have a Droid that only works half the time.  I've had enough, and want to go back to having an iPhone.     
Is it better to go through Orange and purchase through them?  Or would it be any cheaper/easier to go through a store like Mobile Zone?  Or is that even possible?     
Helpful advice and your relevant experience is much appreciated!

			Upon having arrived in Bern 1 month ago I was sold two Prepaid SIM cards from a Sunrise store on the basis that for 1.00CHF/day I could surf the Internet unlimited. Turned out this was completely false - there is a limit and when you reach it you are charged 0.10CHF per 20KB!   
Anyhow .. all I can say is that the so-called ""English Department"" of their phone support is terrible! I spoke to just about every rep they have working there and not a single one is a native English speaker and most are very difficult to understand due to super thick accents - mostly French/African from what I could tell.   
Additionally the reps know close to nothing technical and I find myself having to tell them that ""roughly x-amount of kB is x-amount of MB ..."" etc...    
Numerous times the reps have tried to place the reponsibility on me, the customer, for their systems malfunction or account glitches which they themselves admitted to ... is it a ""Swiss thing"" to want all the power but constantly sidestep taking responsibility!? - I don't think so ...    
Not impressed!

			Thanks, Slaphead. That is a story of one of my friends'. She had a contract with Sunrise（Coincident to mention Sunrise again）in the meantime got her phone （not iphone）. Someday she found that her phone didn't work well. Sunrise took it to repair. Three or four weeks later, my friend was responded that the software in the phone had no problem. My friend got the phone back without any change. The phone is still not working well. If she read your comments, she would have got her phone fixed. But she already had her contract switched from Sunrise to Swisscom. She is using an iphone as well coming from the new contract.

			Hey Mikey, perhaps you can PM along those sites you were speaking of.   
As a Canadian with the Sens elminated I'm definitely cheering on the remainder of the contingent (Flames, Canucks and Habs). I like the Canucks making a deep run, especially if the Sharks go out early (Hillier had a nice game the other night - Swiss note of the day). However, I think the Red Wings ae still the team to beat in the West. The Flames series is going to be tight, but I like the experience if the Flames to bring it out in 7.   
In the East, Boston's depth is good, but I'm hoping for a long series between them and the Habs (especially after the post-game scuffle the other night). I mean MTL collapsed over the last half of the season, so they certainly aren't riding high coming in. I also like the Pens to beat the Flyers (Fleury was astounding last night, he saved the game with that toe save on Carter) and the Rangers to knock off the Caps (if that is truly an upset...).

			Technically one could likely do this ""installation"" oneself as it is just connecting to wires in the telco box. When I moved in here, even though it is a building of at least 30 orso years, the phone was disconnected thus they had to redo that connection, I think it cost 25 chf orso thus was not too bad and the advantage is that the modem already arrived and the guy directly did the line conditioning to the maximum so that was definitely a plus.   
But indeed the one who requests it has to pay...

			Thank you whynhow and FriendlyKiwi   
As you correctly identified I have extenders in the 5-2000 Mhz range, that travel to various sockets around the appartment. I would have to put the Satellite feed into these as well.   
If Cablecom signals are in the < 950 Mhz range than it seems they are in the same range as as broadcast/terrestrial TV signals (5 - 862 Mhz), then it appears that all I require is to check if my wall sockets have cable and satellite outputs and see if ""you can just plug you receiver box/TV to different sockets that will take care of proper signals"". If not then use ""good quality"" Input duplexers.   
The job may be more straightforward than I imagined.   
Many thanks for the guidance.

Combine that with the lousy job SwissIT Repairs tends to do when dealing with issues like that disqualify the tablet for me. After my experience with the first Transformer and after what I've read about the current one, Asus still isn't an option.  I'm just glad that their notebooks aren't that sucky.

Yesterday I connected my mobile phone to internet and thought I still have the option. Today I found that my phone was charged for the internet connection. I called Sunrise and I was told that the surf option will stop immediaterly after the cancellation. This is completely different as Sunrise said few months ago: ""If you cancel the surf option one day after the activation, the option will still run for one month."" So be careful with Sunrise surf option.

			All my Video and music content is stored on a big NAS.  This can be accessed from anywhere in the house via PC, Laptop, WDTV Live, Popcorn, PS3 and any other media device.  I used to use the TV but it does not support full HD, plus seemed to have an issue with too many files.   
Don't use DNLA but all the devices support this if I wanted to use this.   
There are many more hardware solutions available as well with new one's coming out all the time.   
Not sure if the Apple TV will allow you to stream from your network or only supports it's own content (most likely).

			Newbee, I just took a look at your profile. I kinda feel like an ass dumbing the whole ""taking apart a laptop"" thing, seeings how you are in the IT field. My bad.   
Just keep in mind if that thing becomes self aware and starts saying things like ""I"".... pull the cord    
Hope it works out.

I know Verizon has some ""World Phones"" that do have a GSM SIM card slot to allow for roaming while traveling abroad, but if you want to use it with a Swiss SIM card, you have to ask Verizon to unlock it for you.   
If you have AT&T or T-Mobile it will be much easier, as they are GSM. But you still need to ask AT&T or T-Mob to unlock your phone so you can use it with Swiss SIM cards.

			Here's an interesting explanation about SIM-locks.      
Short answer: the phone can either be locked to the general network ""Network Lock"" (eg. Swisscom, Sunrise, Orange), in which case all SIM cards using that network (including resellers) can be used with the phone......    
...or, the phone can be locked more narrowly to a ""Service Provider"" (or ""Subnetwork Lock""), in which case you can only use the phone with the service provider who sold the phone (eg. a Lebara phone will only work with a LeBara SIM card and not a Sunrise SIM)   
So, generally speaking, it depends on how the phone was locked, it's maybe a 50/50 chance it will work with a reseller SIM card. I think older phones maybe were locked with the general ""network lock"", but maybe newer phones are using the narrower ""service provider"" lock (just guessing). Unfortunately there is no way to know how the phone was locked without actually trying another SIM card and finding out.   
PS- MCC for Switzerland is 228. The MNC for Swisscom is 01, Sunrise 02 and Orange 03. That's the 3 physical networks, so a ""Network Lock"" will only look for that. As for ""Subsets"", it's something related to your subscription/SIM card.

			In Europe the 3G networks are very fast and reliable, so the network operators are not in much of a rush to roll out 4G. In the US, Verizon and Sprint's ""3G"" is actually a souped-up 2G (EVDO) that can never go over 3Mbps. So they are in more of a rush to get 4G out.    
AT&T's 3G (HSPA) network has good speeds, and they could probably milk that a while longer before deploying 4G, but if they want to ""keep up with the Jones'"" they'll have to get out 4G sooner than they expected.   
Oh, but for 4G in Switzerland, yea, like the article above says, they are trialing it right now, and will probably start rolling it out next year sometime. Don't hold your breath waiting for it tho...

			Over the years, I have used several hosts for my blogs. First, it was blogger, which is not exactly the most user-friendly platform. Also, it feels a bit outdated. The good thing about blogger is that it makes your blog easily found. Eventually, I ended up moving my sites for wordpress. It is much more sophisticated and gives you a lot of room to play. However, if you want to do something simple and straightforward, this might not be the right choice. There is definitely a learning curve here and you will have to have patience to learn how to work with it. Finally, specially because I wanted to do something quick and easy, ended up trying  . Indeed it is the easiest to use, very intuitive and straightforward. It has also a feel of belonging to a community. If you are not very used to blogging and want something light, this could be an option for you to consider.    
Best of luck with your blog!

Yet as soon as I phoned, the mic went dead. I tried all the different solutions given online by other users, but nothing worked.   
My feeling is it is something that Apple couldn't really resolve during testing so they decided it is easier to change phones and use the problematic phones as their guinea-pigs.

			Curious, are you restricting access of your server pretty tightly, say your equipment only or maybe only a few people?  If that's the case perhaps MAC filtering on the router could be used.     
Blacklisting IPs is going to not be a good solution since they can change all the time.  You could allow IP ranges perhaps if you know the only people accessing originate from a certain ISP but that of course doesn't block hackers in from that or those ISPs.

			Hi,    
If you have swiss SIM card (i.e. Sunrise, Orange, Lycamobile), and you are in Switzerland, then the recipient of the call won't pay anything regardless of the fact where the orginator of the call is.    
If you   a call, while in Switzerland, then you do NOT pay.      
However: note that you need to explain to your relatives that: 
- if they recieve calls to their US number, then they will pay so-called ""roaming charge""    for receiving calls 
- if your relatives   the call from their US number to their CH number, then they will pay   to their US number subscription.   The originator of the call (if in US) will pay only US->US call, though.    
Cheers!

I find that really weird, yet this isn't the first time I've heard this. Wow.   
Maybe I'm just too friendly and pay the bills   at least I don't live in fear of Billag Man... I actually enjoy watching the TV, and although I admit it IS expensive, other taxes seem quite reasonable compared to neighbouring countries. Swings...roundabouts...   
(Although I have nothing but contempt for Billags customer service and the obstacles they place to prevent you from righting their wrongs. It's often easier to pay the bloody bills than contest unfair billings. Swine!)

			btw This was all succesfully done.  The Swisscom ADSL was moved to a new number and my VDSL box autmatically reconnected.   
We now have only VOIP and mobile numbers.   
I like the VOIP system from netvoip where you can have upto 3 numbers per account (including a ported number) and upto 5 devices per number.  This means I can make and receive calls at home or on my Mobile, PC etc... from the numbers I have with them.   
I also have Swizernet to make calls :-)

			If calls to landlines in switzerland are free/cheap for you, betamax voip calls could be an option.   
Here are the price list for various contries     
The company comes up with a new application/name every few months. You need to buy some credit by choosing one of their products like easyvoip.com   
On this website you get a local call number (example 0315260060). You can save numbers in your phonebook like this 0315260060,00417xxxxxx 
When you dial the number, the comma acts like a pause and the rest of the number is punched through. I have been using one or the other service provided by betamax over the last 4 years and never had a problem.    
In some rare cases, people have found that the service is not good enough.    
You can also use their application to make the calls. Maybe now they even have apps for phones. I have not used them though.

			I'm in the same boat having taken an Orange iPhone account in Feb of last year after the sales droid assured me up and down that, should I leave the country, that there wouldn't be a termination fee. Posts here also suggested that this was correct.   
I went to cancel my contract 2 weeks ago and...bam, 800 CHF said the dude at the Orange office. Mobile operators are mobsters on any continent and, forever more, I will buy an untethered phone and a pay as you go SIM.   
However, we both may be in luck as though I don't want to leave with a debt hanging over me, I also absolutely refuse to pay an 800CHF extortion fee.   
See   and click on ""useful tips"" where you will find the following text;   
""i am leaving Switzerland and need to cancel my subscription, how do I do it? 
You're currently an Orange customer but getting ready for adventures outside Switzerland? No problem. You'll simply need to inform us (by calling Customer Care free on 0800 700 700) that you want to cancel your subscription and provide us with a document from your community confirming that you are leaving the country.    
If you have been with us for less than 6 months or have benefited from a handset offer recently, you may have to pay a penalty fee.""   
We have legal insurance and, so, if they try to stick it to us tomorrow, I will just pursue it legally as a) I was lied to at the point of sale and b) their FAQ is ambiguous but also leads me to believe that I can cancel the contract after 6 months without penalty.   
In contrast, Swisscom was a breeze and immediately changed to a pay as you go scheme for my husband's phone. Of course, their service sucked balls outside of Switzerland but...I guess you can't have it all.   
I really hope there's a circle in Dante's hell for Mobile Operators. AT&T first into the fire. Never again will I trust these folks.    
Best advice to those new to CH without an absolute certainty that they'll be around for more than a year - pay up front for the phone and get a pay as you go plan. Much less hassle.

Fortunately too, because Swisscom had no records for the first four previous tenants, but the fifth one rang their bell.

			We have Cablecom, but when I checked on their website and entered our address they said that they had no service at our address.  Now, we are a new build, so that was probably the reason, but relying on the online service determining the service provider is not always 100% accurate.

If you only count pixels HD Suisse (720x1280=921600) shows more of them per frame than BBC HD (1080/2*1440=777600).   
They would argue 720p will give you better image quality. I disagree as they use cameras with 1080 lines sensors and the displays at home have 1080 lines of resolution, the hardware was not built for 720p.   
It was all meant very well but is very much nonsense in reality but I think they will be too proud to admit to that.

			Shouldn't be a problem, I recently changed from Swisscom to another provider and kept the same number.  Your new provider will give you the option of keeping or changing the number, and make all the changes for you.  You do have to give a certain amount of notice to change providers though, I think for us it was 3 months.

3G wasn't working because...roll the drums...we'd turned it off ourselves at sunrise.ch account level last year after we got data charges on the old Nokia handy.   
Now:   
We've installed a Sunrise App which tells us the current account details, so we can now keep an eye on the data usage levels.     
That doesn't explain how we could have used ca.250MB of data between 6th Feb and today - when the phone was off for 2 weeks of that time as we were out of the country.

I have Sunrise mobile and Swisscom mobile, and sometimes Sunrise's works better than Swisscom! Also the prices are quite great and I cannot complain for their service so far.   
Just because if I'd get an internet abonnement with Sunrise I would have to be bounded to them for a year, I decided to try it with WWZ whose contract limit is of 3 months. I will try it and then I might change to Sunrise, but at least I have the option to get away from it shortly.   
Thank you very much for your help and advise!!!

			I have a 3g connection on my phone and also on my ipad and have to say its great, on the pad i have a 5 chf per month contract then i think i pay about 2.50 or 3chf for each day i use it, so if i dont use it on the pad at all in the month its only going to cost me 5 chf.   
Speed is perfect for skype or apple face time and ive uesed both apps fom the pad many times, perfect video from face time ok from skype but then skype is a little poo anyway for video.   
I would spend a little time to really work out how much you need too use the net if paying swisscom is getting too much.  For me i would cut down on a few cigars a month   and keep the home dsl connection.   
Bugger now youve got me thinking aboutnhow much im spending

			I see 20 CHFs for 4 weeks, so I guess those who paid 20CHFs, paid 15 CHFs (first option) and an extra 5 CHF supplement for something.   
This looks like it also updates your address with the person sending the mail unless you pay an additional 15CHF supplement.    
The only other thing that confuses me if this is the per year cost is the asterisk with the comment: ""* Bei der Berechnung der Dauer wird jeder Tag mitgezählt (z.B. 15.09. bis 29.09. entsprechen 15 Tagen).""

			Your right about the delay (now i know whatyou mean) it is a little slow on that point but i dont think there is anything that can be done to improve it.   
Clicking...   
When its off and its clicking is there any flicker of any sign of anŷthing on the screen?  I did notice one thing on ours along these lines but this was before i had the house re wired (old farm house and wireing a million years old). Anyway one of the three phases kept blowing a fuse and for some reason it had an effect on the line voltage to the living room, when the tv was off (on stadby) it would keep clicking but at the same time the screen for a fraction of a second flash.  Not good thats why i had the place re wired.

			I use zattoo quite a bit and also have a registered account.  I have a very fast internet account (for switzerland) and can say if you sign up and pay the video is not much better than the free version, this is unless you have a slow connection.  I also ""hotspot"" my phone to give me an internet connection via my ipad (not 3g) and the video is still very good.   
With a pay account its very quick to switch channels, this is good because they dont always show what is on each channel in the menu.

			From Orange.ch:   
Only the legal owner of an account can cancel a subscription:            If you cancel your contract before its expiry date, you will incur an          early termination fee.  
       If you wish to cancel before the expiry date, a fee will be charged according          to the length of the extension (CHF 300. for 12 months and CHF 500.          for 24 months / iPhone customers: CHF 600.- for 12 months and CHF 800.- for 24 months). 
       Deadline: your cancellation request must reach us at least 30 days before          the date your contract is due to end.

You will not see any benefit in streaming videos, as 1) the streaming will be limited by the network speed, and 2) streaming it faster will not help unless you want to watch it faster!   From what you've described, the only difference you'll only notice is that your computer starts up faster.

Maybe I'm just too friendly and pay the bills   at least I don't live in fear of Billag Man... I actually enjoy watching the TV, and although I admit it IS expensive, other taxes seem quite reasonable compared to neighbouring countries. Swings...roundabouts...   
(Although I have nothing but contempt for Billags customer service and the obstacles they place to prevent you from righting their wrongs. It's often easier to pay the bloody bills than contest unfair billings. Swine!)

Exactly.... if you are going to give advice then do some basic fact checking first   
Written on the first page of Cablecom !!!!         Requires a cable connection with feedback channel from upc cablecom or one of our partner networks. The costs for this connection (usually CHF 25.05/month plus an obligatory copyright fee of CHF 2.35/month) are normally covered by the ancillary costs in rented apartments. Minimum contract period 12 months. A one-off fee of CHF 49. is charged for activating the service. Paper-based bills: CHF 1.50 per bill.
* Source: www.swisscom.ch; situation: 16.01.2012. Swisscom offers also other Internet subscriptions.

			For us, CC has been the best customer care experience we've had so far here. They're dedicated to get things done and usually quickly and painlessly. That said, CC's products seem to have more outages than Swisscom's - but you get a lot more for the same money from CC

It's a better phone all round. If you have an iPhone 3 or even 3GS it's a giant leap forward. If you have a 4, then not so much.   
However, the iPhone 5 is rumored to be coming summer-autumn of this year so, best to wait for that to upgrade.

Terrestrial (DVB-T), over the air, free 
Cable (DVB-C), basic fee for analog, DVB-C is pay 
VDSL, Swisscom TV, pay 
VDSL, Sunrise TV, pay     
upc cablecom (cable) 
Swisscom (VDSL)

Various (satellite) (not all are valid for CH)   
Quantity of channels received vary hugely by Reception Technology and Pay Providers.

Welcome to the WLAN at the ZB   
    The ZB offers free internet access on its premises.     
                    Students   
            As a student of a Swiss university, you have access to free WLAN, provided your institution participates in   and the VPN-client of your university is installed on your computer.   
This enables you to access the licensed e-resources of your institution.         
        Non-students   
            As a member of the general public, you can register for free  using your mobile telephone number. In return, you receive a free SMS  with a password. This access, consisting of mobile number and password,  is valid for 6 months.   
Please note: this does not enable you to access the licensed e-resources of the ZB.         
Please start your university's VPN-client now!          "	an excellent reputation	Join Date: Nov 2008	Groaned at 11 Times in 4 Posts	Internet in Zurich central libray	Breezy	Posts: 546

			Just to follow up: the ESPN HD channel is looking better now. I guess it just happened that Cablecoms re-transmission of this channel (or the original satellite transmission) had problems around that time, since it looks to have cleared up and is now working fine   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2008	Groaned at 38 Times in 36 Posts	Cablecom ESPN America HD Pixelation	esto	Posts: 1,272

			I know there is no bandwidth limitation imposed by Cablecom, I am more interested in knowing just out of my own curiosity. I'm a ""techie-type"" with a large home network, that has just about everything integrated (VOIP phones, NAS, TV, media-streamer, etc), and I'm interested to see any sudden increase in internet bandwidth, so it could give me a heads up if one of the devices is not acting correctly, or if something else is wrong. For example, if for several months I am using 2GB per month, then suddenly one month it's 20GB, then I will see something looks wrong and investigate why the sudden increase.   
I do have a DD-WRT router in my home network, and there is a way with rflow to monitor data-traffic of each networked device, however it does it in kind of a messy way (needs an external PC running mSQL to stay on), and counts internal traffic also (ie: no way to differentiate traffic staying inside my network, or traffic going external).    
So, in short, I just want to see what my monthly internet data usage is. Pretty simple request, that seems doesn't have a simple answer   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2008	Groaned at 38 Times in 36 Posts	Monitor Bandwidth Usage on Cablecom?	esto	Posts: 1,272

			We got a 0.3db for our new one and we're only around 8 to 10 kms from Fribourg as well.   
Are you getting any sort of signal at all?  Silly question, but have you put the SKY card in the box?   
It's very easy to miss what you're aiming at for satellites sometimes.  Our old dish used to shift now and again and it only needed the slightest movement the wrong way to lose everything.  You need to be able to see your box's signal test screen so you can see what signal strength you're getting and when the lock says OK.

			Thanks m5...., but what you say is that they sell you different products, say BBC1 SD and BBC1 HD. It's clearly stated on their contract. 
What I was saying is that it seemed to me that the same channel BBC1 SD looked better on the ""premium"" offer. Which is not the case, I hope. 
Technically speaking it's possible though. They have the bandwidth. 
The reason that makes it less possible is that they should make a neat trick, since the Channel did not change its position on the TV listing.

Maybe a better LNB would help to. i.e. an Invacom 0.3db or a Titanium 0.2db (although I read getting below 0.3db is almost impossible at normla temperatures).  If you think you mihgt upgrade to a PVR in future then switching to a Twin would be a good reason to change the LNB.

			In addition to checking your network settings, you can check for the malware with most updated malware scanners or by downloading and running the DNSChanger Trojan removal tool from SecureMac.com. Because the malware has been around for a long time and has not changed much for OS X systems, most reputable malware scanners should easily detect it.

			Hi Surfpowder,      
In response to your comments:   
I noticed a problem with my photo gallery the day before when it kept closing when I was trying to look at the album. Unfortunately I did not take the time to check it out and fix it.   
I changed the password immediately and (hopefully) took all the steps necesary. I am now resetting the phone to factory setting. I have only used the Android market - for freebees I thought were ok choosing those with the most stars.    
I disconnected the yahoo app immediately as well. When I re-install I will use the ""SSL"" option - good idea.    
As for passwords: I have always used different ones as you suggested - and clean out the cache after Ebanking.    
We use a firewall on our closed system here at home for the 6 computers we use.    
Not only are security measures the best prevention, but to also try to think one step ahead. We have to renew our software in a week. The security gap was on my phone was discussed 1 day before the attack. sigh....    
I really thought the iphones had better protection for use between the apple products. Now I don't feel so bad for not having one.

			I would also go for one of the mobile solutions, but the old Sunrise dial-up still appears to be there: 
Dial-up 
Numéro de téléphone: 0840 555 555 
Numéro de téléphone de létrange: +41 44 555 00 65 
Nom dutilisateur: Sunrise 
Mot de passe: freesurf 
Nom de serveur / DNS 
Les serveurs DNS sont normalement attribués automatiquement. Si cela ne devait pas être le cas chez vous, vous pouvez configurer manuellement les serveurs DNS avec ladresse IP suivante: 
194.230.1.39 
194.230.1.71 
194.230.1.103   
But this will be much slower than the mobile solutions. By the way, depending on your fixed line subscription, calling the ""international number"" (after having removed the international prefixes) may come up much cheaper, as it should count as a national call and be included in your subscription, rather than the 0840 number which is always charged.

			Anyone from the US have any recent experience with Netfilx and Wii?   
I have a European Wii and a US Netflix account. I brought the Wii disc back with me from California, and it cannot be read by my Wii. Wondering if it is a problem with the format of the Wii/NetFlix disc, or an issue with the fact that my ISP is from Europe.    
There must be a workaround to make this work in CH...

			Hello,    
I recently bought a kindle and I've been buying books from amazon.com account. I tried buying german books from amazon.de the other day and it told me to transfer my account from .com. I wanted to know the consequences before I transfer so I didn't do it. From googling, some says you can transfer back and forth as many times as you want and the other says it's not possible. I also wasn't sure if my books from the .com account goes automatically to .de when I transfer.  Does anyone have any experience with this?

In CD/DVD/BD players There are lots of moving parts, lenses etc.. that get the data off the disc itself, then there is the components used to handle this data, plus Error corrections etc...  Quality will depend on number 'bits' etc.. For CD's the digital information is converted to analogue etc..  On top of this is the quality of the power supply and if different component groups share the same power supply or have separate ones (to avoid interferance etc...)..   
I suggest some google searches on these topics.

Only the modem gets an external (public) IP as UTH said.  
Every other device gets a private IP which is only reachable within the Home Network. This is managed by the router.

			Christmas is a great time for families and great fun, but it is also a time for parents to rest.   
My girls aged 11 + 13 are absolutely bonkers about this website they found,   (it is NOT one of mine and I do not have any benefit from promoting it) which is not only keeping them incredibly engaged but also has them collecting and using our waste to make things.. (like Blue Peter did for my generation).   
It is BRILLIANT ! They are HOOKED ! now we can't throw anything away until it has been throughly examined for potential use.   
We have installed in our girls the importance of being green and that they are personally responsible for the preservation of the planet and it's resources, after using the above site they are now teaching us, it is so refreshing to see companies developing children's websites that actively promote the greener way...   
With all of the waste that is generated over the Christmas period, wrapping, boxes, plastic etc etc we are confident that it can now be put to use, in fact we feel that this waste that their presents arrive in will instead of becoming rubbish will be part of their presents.   
It will also give us a reprieve as parents to enjoy Christmas a little more !!!!   
PS I have restricted access until Christmas to maintain the novelty   "	annoyed a few people around here	Join Date: Sep 2010	Groaned at 41 Times in 16 Posts	Kids, the holidays & waste	onei	Posts: 414

			Had cablecom(now UPC) in two different buildings since late 2009. Took a long time to get connected (they had to organise an electrician to do some re-wiring which they paid for). Always had great speeds, even now living in a large (modern) apartment complex on Perolles. Speeds are always great though some drop outs from time to time...think that's my wireless router though so can't blame UPC for that.   
Digital TV wise when I had it it was quite good, never any complaints. They get the thumbs up from me.

Consequently you can experience a wide variety of speeds; even during the same session.

I'm not saying your complaint about pricing is wrong, but there are a lot more factors to take into account. There's some relevant market data   - they've had to build some assumptions into it, but it's interesting reading nevertheless.

you just need a universal LNB, there isnt a specific ""sky"" LNB.   
90cm is more than enough, i have frinds with the original sky mini dish 45cm and its ok except in bad weather. With a properly aligned 80 cm dish in all but the most extreme weather, its perfect.   
I would suggest buying a simple needle/scale type strength meter as the built in guage on the sky box has a major time delay and is heavily damped so it will take you ages.   
Also remember to rotate the LNB to the correct angle as that will make a massive difference in signal strength.   
Out landlord complained about the balcony dish also - no one else with a dish recieved a complaint (those nasty auslanders again!)  so i put a section of Balkonschutz/Balkonverkleidung  on the railing of the balcony so the dish can not be seen from the road. The material is grey so blends in perfectly with the building.  Everyone is happy now.

However if HTC had the marketing smarts of Apple, they could have hijacked the iPhone 4 launch before people started getting locked into 12-24 month contracts.

			...and until then downloading is free and not criminalised. The authorities - not Cablecom for sure - won't bother to look in unless you're a massive user and clearly up to no good. Taking a few albums off the net before deciding to go to a record store - remember those? - and actually buying the album and supporting the artist who created it - you wouldn't think of not buying the album, right? - is so far not naughty in Switzerland.   
Do purchase the albums you like so Robbie Williams isn't all we have left though. Or better still, support the artists in live performances.

The thread you are looking for is entitled: Dummies Guide: Satellite install for free to air channels. No monthly fees - cheap -      
I'ts well worth doing your homework especially if you want:   
a) watch French, German or Swiss channels 
b) to record programs 
c) have a second receiver (I have a Panasonic telly that's also a sat receiver)   
If you want, you can borrow my cheap sat finder meter. Send me a PM.

			I received a pleasant surprise when I called up   ( 044 277 91 11 worked for me as the 0800 66 88 66 number was busy ) to terminate the basic Digital TV Package giving them 2 months´ notice in advance.    
The service representative counter offered and I accepted a free 12 month subscription, which can be terminated 2 months prior. Sweet - had I not called, I would still be paying - so you might want to call up enquire if you qualify for the sweetener.

			For those of you who travel a lot to the EU it seems that a Bern based company has introduced a new SIM card for roaming with supposedly   than the three major carriers.   
Yes, there are special packages that each of the carriers offers but you might want to compare this to what you are currently paying to see if it might make sense for you. I don't know much about the service other that the article in 24Heures.

			I use a local provider called EvardNet - 55chf/month for 20mbit cable connection. I have no problems squeezing out the full 20mbits at any time.   
My tv subscription is included with the rent, and I use Voip phones (one with sipcall.ch and the other one with a foreign provider) and only pay for the calls made.   
Overall I think I'm getting a pretty good deal.

			We use AppleTV (1stGen) to stream movies, TV shows and limited internet. But YouTube is actually cool on the big screen. I might do a bit more internet surfing if there was a better input device. Also, my 2 year old Samsung TV has a very limited set of widgets. In the US, I could do much more.   
What I would like to do is stream NFL or TV shows from my Mac Book Pro to the TV. Not sure if a miniDVI to HDMI cable will do the trick. I might be able to get my brother to rig a SlingBox, but anyone got any other ideas?   
Maybe it is better on another thread...

			With regard the ADSL Innternet without the phone line fee (CHF 25.35) - not possible with Swisscom or Orange. Sunrise does advertise it's included in their package price (that's actually why I'm going with them) but their prices might look dearer.   
If you can get a cable connection, you don't need a phone line rental. But I heard rumours that you do need to pay monthly rental for the cable line which is almost the same as the landline fee. I mean, that fee is separate to the advertised prices.   
With regard to Billag, I have an impression you don't need to pay if you don't have TV or radio devices. Computers are excluded so far.

			This is from ricksteves.com a travel writer which is pretty much what I thought.  Get a prepaid SIM card for each country you are in to make calls in that country.     
Rates: If you're calling from the SIM card's home country, you'll generally pay around 10 to 20 cents per minute for domestic calls to fixed lines, and nothing to receive calls. (Calls to mobile phones tend to be more expensive.) Calling the US can cost $1 per minute or more — but using an international phone card with your mobile phone can bring that cost down to pennies.   
A SIM card works most affordably in the country where you buy it. If you roam with the SIM card in another country, call prices go up, and you pay to receive incoming calls. If your SIM card is from a European Union (EU) country, fees are regulated when roaming within the EU: You'll pay no more than about 55 cents per minute to make calls or 21 cents per minute to receive calls. If your SIM card is from a non-EU country — or if you're traveling in one — roaming fees can be much higher. If you'll be making a lot of calls, it can be cheaper to buy a new SIM card for that country.   
Remember to store your phone numbers in the phone itself, rather than on the SIM card — or you'll lose access to them when you switch SIMs. When storing phone numbers, include the plus (+) sign and the country code so your calls will go through, regardless of where you're calling from.

			Not putting up shelves....   
My previous projector could be mounted on a tripod, giving me full control over movement (i'm not using it for a home cinema).  My new projector doesn't have the right fitting, and I can't find anything for sale that will adapt it.  So I'm think I may have to make my own platform or adapt a universal mount to do the job.   
Long story short, I need to make a thing that a tripod can screw into, and I can screw other things into that thing.  Apparently the screw for a tripod is 1/4""-20. I need to get something to mate with this, am I going to have to get some special drill?  Or is it possible to make the right thing out of stock parts?   
I have a Jumbo and a Conrad nearby from which I should be able to get most stuff from.  If I knew what I was actually looking for it would be a big help.  Unfortunately I have no idea about the DIY speak for the appropriate bits and bobs in English, let alone German.

But my uk phone only works with cablecom digital phone, not with swisscom as the signal is transmitted differently so you will not get a tone.

By then, my contract will be up for renewal. Still hoping that cablecom will buy them, so that I can profit from a good bundle deal :-)

			just a word of warning, be careful to have a contract with naxoo, the address check on their site is deceptive e.g. it puts the responsibility of having a valid cable connection on you.   
I bought naxoo box from FUST just to discover that my building does not have cable connection that they need (on their site address check okey the connection)   
so I will need to subscribe to cablecom in order to watch naxoo and pay additional charges.   
I wrote to naxoo, and they told me that not having a valid cable is not sufficient to cancel the contract, in other words whether i get naxoo service or not, those GENTS expect me to pay for it.   
And TCS Assista will not help since they dont help in resolving abonement issue (although they do support  achat/vente and location ??  )   
Luckily I will be leaving geneva in abt 2 months so could cancel on that pretext, I would have loved to drag them to court had my TCS cover worked.

The Recall service effectively records entire channels of the users choosing, and archives them for later viewing - that is my understanding, anyway. Also my interpretation of Recall   service is slightly different to the above. My reading was that it only holds them in the archive for 30 days, but you can always use this option for recording.   
However, monthly, quarterly or yearly subscription is offered - the latter is about CHF45 p.a. - and offers higher picture quality and indefinite archiving of ""recorded"" programmes.

The quality is ok.  However,  you can pay for a subscription which gives you a better quality!  Maybe HD?  I am certain it is much cheaper than say Cablecom!  I am not sure of the price per month, because I use the free version on my iPhone & computer.

It won't be easy to get an iPhone without a credit history here. I'd personally buy the phone unlocked directly from Apple (or, if it doesn't have to be an iPhone, go for the new HTC Desire HD that's going to be released in October - definitely the much better phone). 
Waiting time for the iPhone is about 3-9 weeks in Switzerland at the moment.    
As for the provider: in my opinion, Orange is the worst of the three Swiss providers. They have (by far) the worst coverage, they don't have EDGE (which sucks big time if you have a smartphone - once you leave their measly 3G coverage area, you'll be looking at 9.6-56k download speeds. An average website takes about 2-4 minutes to load at that speed) and their customer service is sub-par. There's only one factor that makes a lot of people here choose Orange: they offer calls abroad at local rates. So if you will be calling overseas all the time from your cell-phone, you could consider them.    
Otherwise, go for Sunrise - they're way cheaper and have a vastly better network - much better 3G network and EDGE where there's no 3G. Unlimited calling to Swiss networks and unlimited data (speed reduced after reaching 2gb / month) costs 105 Fr.  Unlimited texts cost an additional 19 Fr.  - but who needs texts if you have push e-mail on your phone.    
The most expensive of the providers is Swisscom. They used to have the best network. Nowadays, they are suffering from network-congestion a lot  because they have the most customers. Their network is generally slower than Sunrise's. They have the best customer service, though.

The Samsung dedicated remote includes a small screen so you can watch what's on in a different room, which is dangerously addictive but stupidly expensive.   
Make sure you do your homework on which set you want. There are a lot of stores selling these fancy looking sets from previous seasons without informing you you're buying older technology. I baulked at the prices and specs Interdiscount / MediaMarkt were asking and went straight to  , who were great and a lot cheaper than the big boys.

All of them I like and all of them have just started a news season around now and I've got back to studying again. I better resist the edge to download them all otherwise I might as well quit the course. Especially boardwalk empire is so bloody addictive

I considered that plan as well, but I blew through the 2GB/month limit on Swisscom in two days (hence my trying out the cheaper, somewhat slower, but not-limited Sunrise). Lesson learned: if a computer has been offline for months due to being moved, doing Windows Updates on mobile broadband can be bad.    
In general, my use for mobile broadband is intermittent (though bandwidth-heavy): a backup connection in case my wired connection is down, and also for connecting when away from the apartment or university, so the prepaid plans that charge only on the days one uses the service made a lot of sense for me. Naturally, your mileage may vary.

2887	01.11.2011, 03:28	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: New Zealand (soon Appenzell)	"    Frankly, the media companies here are dominated by people who don't only speak German, they mostly also hold an M.A. in German, sociology, media studies - all of which are massively language-oriented. I minored in media studies myself and have yet to find a Swiss media company where English (or anything except for German, French and / or Italian) is spoken. Most companies look for people who speak at least two of the official languages.    
Also, the Swiss media landscape is extremely limited - outside of public TV and radio plus about 2-3 bigger newspapers, there's absolutely nothing. Most areas in Switzerland don't have any media companies at all but are instead served by larger corporations in the bigger cities. There are close to ZERO media jobs available in Switzerland and the number has been on the decline for 15 years or so.   
Apart from that, you'll find it very difficult to obtain a work permit here if you don't have a Swiss or EU passport.    
Sorry to say this so bluntly: you'll either have to get C2 (fluency)-level German or you'll be struggling massively to find anything.

They are definitely stored on the phone and available when not connected to the internet.   
2nd the sentiment about battery and running out.  Have (so far!) always made sure my phone is fully charged the day before I travel, but from what I have seen, most SBB trains appear to have power sockets available so if you keep a phone charger with you, even that shouldn't be an issue.

			Hi there   
I work in Basel three days a week and live in St Louis (FR), just over the border. I have been researching mobile phone options as I'm keen to get an iPhone (am currently on prepaid M Budget). It's really hard to work out what's best as I can't seem to find a provider that offers a package with good rates in both countries. M Budget contracts offer good prices in Switzerland (on the Swisscom network- which I can also get at home), but once you enter the French network, you pay roaming charges which are extortionate.   
I came across a company called Transnatel, which offers calls and texts specifically for cross-border workers, whereby you get both a French and Swiss number and can call at local rates, but they don't seem to offer data packages.   
Has anyone cracked this one? I've asked around at work as there are lots of people in a similar situation, but there doesn't seem to be one offer that suits everyone, so a lot of people opt to have two phones, which I would rather avoid if possible.   
Any help would be much appreciated!

If you use Swisscom, then you can have the Natel liberty start and pay 19 CHF / month + 0.70/hr for the fixed landline calls. So 1 hour talk with India will cost you 1.9 CHF (excluding the fix fee of 19 CHF).

Backup services will have a universal client that actually backs up data , and stores it in generational format so that file versioning is achieved.   
Be clear about your requirements, do you need an off site copy of local storage , or the ability to restore to a point in time, any specific file, or do you need synchronisation of remote storage between clients , or do you need to move off local storage onto cloud storage ? Many options are available.   
For Security and Professionalism, I would recommend that you consider a Virtual Private Server, under your full control, preferably with mirrored contingency/backup data centers. This would allow you to use rsynch and rcopy commands to copy local files to your remote server, if you get a VPN sorted, you can have the server present it's remote storage as a local drive on the PC and the PC users can use native backup tools that the clients are familiar with.   
Going with a VPS gives you full control, n-way mirroring , n-way synching, verifiable encryption (encrypt before you send and store on an alien server) etc.  
The server can also be used for mail/web/ftp/torrent purposes.    
The down side ? 50CHF a month instead of 5CHF a month.   
How much is your data worth ? Google VPS and Europe and take your pick.

			I would recommend going with UPC Cablecom. Their support used to be terrible, but it's OK  
now. Probably best to ask the agent what connections you have.    
Most apartments have cable TV, but sometimes with a small local supplier and no Internet.    
You probably already have a Swisscom telephone line to the house with a box in the stair  
well. You have to rent the line for the ADSL connection.   
Both these connections might require a local electrician, and that adds to the cost!

			Duh... you are so right.  I completely forgot about the card, I was just fixated on the box.

			Thank you all for helping me sort this out.   
I got to the bottom of it all eventually, and am liable for the connection fee on top of the subscription fee.    
If anyone reading this is thinking of subscribing to cablecom, its definitely worth checking with cablecom and your landlord who is liable for this.  My contract says my Nebenkosten covers the connection, but apparently, after the contracts were drawn up, the property owners agreed with cablecom that the tenants would pay..... I know that this is a bit fishy in itself, so I will be requesting a full breakdown of the Nebenkosten ""costs"" and any refund due.   
Oh, and the small costs totalling about 5chf on my subscription bill....well, these are fees for the connection for the first day of connection.  Apparently cablecom have to wait 24 hours before enabling the subscription proper, so charge on a daily basis for this.  This has been refunded.

Sussed!   
I deleted all email accounts of the phone, then manually entered the settings using the mac NOT iPhone setting from my gmail account, with the exception of the outgoing server where I just left off the email addy'     
Bizzare but there you have it and the phone is now leaving sent mail on gmail and both mac are picking them up.... happy days.

			Hello- New to Switzerland, but we just signed for an apartment in Adliswil (Zurich), and I have been looking at the breitband.ch website (found through comparis.ch- amazing tool), and I was wondering how do you find out about availability in a location, or is it available nationwide?  Is there an online tool, or is email (don't have a phone yet) my only option?  Also, I didn't see anyone who has posted any experiences with this service yet (maybe the OP has some experience at this point?)- and I was looking for a reference.  Breitband seems much less expensive than cablecom or swisscom, so I am all about the savings, but I want to find out if I can get it and if it's any good.   
Thanks!

			Overall I find it very good - record two channels simultaneously (inlcuding HD), 8 day EPG etc. It meets my needs exactly and does what it says on the tin, but of course everybody will have different requirements. Make sure you're happy with the   - Freesat doesn't carry everything.   
On the downside the GUI could be a little better thought out and there are one or two annoying glitches which I hope will be sorted out through an OTA update (e.g. you can't delete a programme while another is being recorded).   
However we have to remember that this is a very new product which will continue to evolve, and I'm happy to accept these kind of issues if I'm going to ""early adopt"" a product.

You can also use Skype on your smartphone, although the iPhone works best with Skype (as opposed to Android which has varying degrees of success). You'll need a good data package though. Orange.ch offers 1gb as standard but for an extra 45chf per month you can get that upped to unlimited data (throttled at 5gb).

			I just received a letter form my local cable company that they made a deal with upc cablecom. This deal involves that I get to pay 20 francs per month more for an offer that is worse than what I have now. Awesome. Calls abroad were 2 or 3 cents per minute and now go up to 11 or 22. My internet speed is supposedly going up, but I don't care because the current 10mb/s is more than fast enough for me.

			I have cablecom and i am vety happy with it. You can change ur settings so that TV shows are played in their original language. However sometimes you have to do it manually or sometimes they just dont do it!   
Some films are played in English and sometimes not. Depends on the channel. But on some nights you get a good choice of films/programmes to watch due to all the channels available.

			These things happen from time to time.   
A couple of months ago on Swisscom TV, for about 5 days, the whole BBC2 programme was one hour out of synch compared to the on-screen TV guide. It made it a nightmare to try to work out what was really on when, and of course worse still to try to record anything as the recording was synched with the TV guide, not the actual broadcast.    
All the other channels were OK, and after a few days it sorted itself out...

			Hi Kirschner,   
Depends on the scale of the business you're planning. If you want features like a secure checkout/ paymant cart etc you definitely need professional advise from a web agency, On the other hand if it is just going to be more like an online catalog with inventory details you could choose to do it yourself. You can use services like   or   and buy a domain from them (eg : free version of blogger is   but for USD 10 you can buy a domain from blogger   (subject to availability).I bought my own domain from blogger for a blog I own and find it really economical/ useful.   
You can also consider setting up a shop on ebay to use it as a platform for selling things .   
Hope this helps.

If you consider the internet connection as something like:   
internet -> ISP (the company, e.g. CableCom that provides your internet service) -> modem in your house -> your MacBook -> data processed and on your screen   
Then by far the slowest part of that chain will be the ISP -> modem link.  All the other components will be able to run far faster.  As technology improves, each of these steps gets faster, but the relative difference remains because they are all getting faster.  Even a 5+ year old computer and home network should be fast enough to deal with data from today's fastest home internet connections, so it is likely that your MacBook will be fast enough for you for the foreseeable future.  I have a 2008 MacBook base model, and it has no trouble keeping up with the speed that CableCom can get data to my flat, so a 2011 model should be more than good enough.

			Success!   
The website software is slightly diif' than the disc, but it's improved and has more auto links than the previous version, so that""s fine. However, you cannot use the normal uninstaller with HP as it only removes current software, not old or corrupt stuff (my problem) and these left behind files messes with the new install and prevents it from working. You must enter the uninstaller as normal, but hold  down (on a mac) control, option and command   press uninstall. This wipes ALL HP files, and allows for a clean install from the link above. Everything now works perfectly again.

			Yes Orange has very bad coverage. But try Migros budget mobile - they are supposed to use the Swisscom network and have very attractive prices, although probably not the the highest level for demanding users. We are using Orange prepay and it's just fine. We don't call very often and plus with the ADSL package and Fixtalk they offer some discount.

			ESPN America is almost certainly as good as you're going to get on a Swiss cable provider.   
Cablecom carry it, in both regular and HD versions.  See their website, and make sure you click on Switzerland as your location, as programmes vary from the UK version for example.  They show some college football games - but I haven't checked their schedule in detail for this year.   
To get Big Ten network, you might be best to try a proxy server so that you appear to be in the US, then watch it online if you can - there plenty of threads discussing how and where to do that on here.

I   if you want to keep prepay SIMs working you can just dial any number and get a ringtone and hang up without connecting, then your six months extention restarts again. Same if you answer a call on your prepay number.

			Hi, 
Out of curiosity I was looking for the ""dead drops"" locations and there's a few in Switzerland: 
Source:     
it's basically some USB storage ""inserted into walls, etc..."". Where everyone can go and exchange files.   
Of course if there's autoruns it's a good way to grab viruses...   
And of course, ""what for""? what exchanging? ...   
I just found the concept amusing, so I share it.     
PS: If you intend to create a ""dead drop"" I suggest you immunize it  it's about putting a read only ""autorun.inf"", only someone who wants to delete it can do it (it's about hidden system file and deleting a special folder).

			The only problem with stepdown transformers is they seem to use a lot of power when plugged in, even if the appliances are not running. I brought my wifi router US phone and Vonage modem from the US, and plugged them into 3 separate step down transformers.    
After speaking with my neighbors, we determined that my power bills were a LOT higher than theirs, with somewhat similar usage patterns. The power company actually came out to take some measurements and determined that my stepdown transformers were probably costing me about 40% extra per year.  I was surprised and skeptical, but it seems that they were right. I could have bought a wifi router and phone here and gone with just one transformer and would have saved plenty of money. Maybe i had bad transformers, but they seem to always be a fairly warm, so I figure that means they are consuming power.

			When I first got Swisscom, I had the same exact problem (but I was a new customer, and thus it had never worked before anyway).     
All the lights were working and the computer was showing a connection... but there was no connection.     
It turned out the problem was where the telephone wires come into the house, so the Swisscom guy had to fix that.

I've got both, well not   rather  , a cable tv provider from Zug.         is recording menu and options. For example you can log onto Swisscom's website and set your box to record any program you wish from anywhere in the world. Not something someone would need every day but there has been a few times I was at work and remembered I forgot to set it to record a show I wanted to watch so I just logged on from work and did it remotely. In addition to being able to edit the recording times you can also program the channels via the Internet as well (add, remove or rearrange channels). I set up the whole list of channels and all my preferences via my computer instead of the box.   
Very stable system (see disadvantages cable tv)      Reception, from day 1 my Swisscom TV reception has never equalled my cable tv provider's quality. The first day Swisscom announced they were making TV available I ordered it, those early days (first year) were horrible. Often the sound didn't match up with the picture. They worked it out finally but it required me to abandon ISDN and go back to analog phone service. Analog allowed me to use a faster DSL which gave me better tv quality. As an incentive to switch to analog Swisscom was nice enough to pay me CHF 250.- for new phones and did the conversion (technician came to my place for the install) free of charge.   
Channels that are broadcasting in two languages always revert back to the first sound track when changing channels. If you like to channel surf that means constantly having to hit the language selection button to see if the channel in question is broadcasting in English (very annoying).           External hard drives..!! I've got a 1 TB drive hooked up to my recorder and can record hundreds of hours of programing, many times more than the Swisscom TV achieve. Plus if you absolutely don't want to erase the drive you can always go out and buy a new one.    
More HD channels.      having to hit the language button to see if a program is broadcasting in English. Once you've set the system preferences to English you will have   every time you switch to a channel that is broadcasting a program in English..!! (My most loved advantage of cable tv over Swisscom).      System crashing/rebooting. Sometimes clicking something in the menu or changing channels would cause the system to crash and reboot, very annoying in the beginning but they seem to have most of the bugs worked out. It still crashes from time to time but at least now it's only once every month or two.       : To put it in a nutshell, phone and cable providers do best what they were designed to do (Swisscom=phones, cable TV=television). Sure they've tweaked their technologies to included each other's services but when you get right down to it, a phone company still serves the best phone service and a cable tv company, the best tv reception.

			As with many things on the digital highway, technical innovation out paces country boundaries, local laws and the existing market players.   
tvcatchup has shown the future of this new content delivery method called the web based Personal Video Recorder (PVR).   
The site highlighted a better way to do things. They found a gap in the market.   
I fully expect other web based PVR sites and services to fill the void.   
It's an technical innovation inevitability!   
Also I would expect tvcatchup.com to reappear in due course, though without the video sharing/lending amongst members. It may be hosted outside the UK.

So far, their prices keep decreasing! For calls to CH, they are now at 0.29CHF for fixed and mobile.

3062	08.08.2011, 15:15	Member	Thanked 92 Times in 24 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Agreed. My husband used to have Orange, and he didn't have reception half of the time. Sometime later, he talked to his company, who agreed to pay his mobile bill (on-call work). He just had to cancel Orange and get the number transferred to the provider they used. Not so simple!   
First of all, Orange said it was ok to transfer, but the new provider kept sending us letters that the transfer had been refused. This went on for months. All of a sudden, the people at Orange were claiming he had to pay the next bill. Well, after a few months of back and forth, we find out they thought he owed a bill from 2 years before. He talked to them, and they said, ""oops, no, you don't have to pay. We'll cancel your contract."" He asked if he had   fee to pay and the answer was a no. Number was transferred, and we thought we had heard the end of it.   
Oh, no. A month or so later, we get a bill from a collection agency (on behalf of Orange) for something like 300 CHF, threatening us to pay within x days or else! Now, we had never received any bill of the sort from Orange (so how had it been escalated to a collection agency for failure to pay?), and they had assured us there was absolutely nothing to pay in bills, cancelation, etc. Nice.   
So, never again will we consider Orange. It was such a nightmare. Though I have no idea if the others are better.   
Anyway, good luck. I hope your experience is better than ours was.

The point was that the OP lives in Indonesia. So it would be significantly more difficult to send a phone to Winterthur from there. However, I'd personally not worry too much about it, the manufacturer warranties should be international even if the phone is imported here by digitec.   
That said was the last phone I bought from Motorola one where the sales guy managed to convince me that it is a great advantage to be able to use AAA batteries in it... think it was 1997.

			I know you mean by online conection with a computer, but if it helps at all I use Whatsapp on my phone, my family in mexico with any phone with internet option also have it and we send sms unlimited, just look that it requires data transfer, so you need to make sure you have a plan that includes data OR if your phone can search for wireless internet then it works too. I send them everyday pics or short videos of the  boys and its a wonderful tool to stay in contact with them. no cost of downloading.    
If you download the aplication make sure you have saved the number of your friend/family with the country and area code. once you have started the aplication in the favorites tab bar you will see who else from your contact list has the aplication. Ah before I forget the other person must have the aplication, internet etc.

			Yeah, I bought my lenovo via the US website, but didn't try shipping it over. My brother brought it with him when he came on vacation... Didn't want to risk Swiss customs as I've had my hands burned in the past before (paid in customs nearly what the item value was!).   
One thing you should check is the international warranty service extends to Switzerland on the lenovo website. My screen packed in but the service centre replaced without hassle (only I had to post across Switzerland as lenovo wouldn't let me upgrade a US warranty and get onsite service in Europe)

			Last year we were initially using a Swisscom dongle at around 7.50  a day.  then changed to Orange as only 5 a day.  the day starts from after mid-night and finished at mid-night on the day.  If you dont use one day, you dont pay.  Usually pick up a prepaid slip from supermarket for 30chf, but believe you can get lower/higher amounts. Depending where you are, you might need to check the reception will be good for whatever network you choose.

			Follow the above link, and then visit the Television Reception part of the Swisswiki.     
From what I've seen though, the choices for TV reception are pretty much the Bluewin and Cablecom services over the wire, or SKY or the Free-to-air satellite services.  The Swiss satellite stuff is more-or-less incompatible with the SKY stuff (You'll need a bigger dish for sky, and a different tuner box).  Pretty much, if it's not covered in that sticky link, there isn't any info on it around.   
Good Luck.

			In Zurich upc cablecom have the fastest network, the lowest prices, and pretty good service. Plus loads of forum members here online that can help, should you need it.   
You'll be up and running within 48hrs after ordering online.   
Tips: 
Always use GigE networks inside your house if going for more than 50Mbit/s internet speed.   
Use cabled networks whereever you can (although the new upc cablecom modems have wifi built in), simply because cable is reliable, always on, and much faster than wifi.   
I have both, but WiFi is a backup if the cabled connection fails

3075	03.08.2011, 01:21	Forum Veteran	Thanked 3,205 Times in 1,227 Posts	Location: City by the Bay	"    Firstly: use a wire connection with cat5e or cat6 cables on GigE ports and monitor that connection. If the wired connection is fine, it means the WLAN is dodgy. If WLAN dodgy, follow usual WLAN diagnosis (switch of other devices, move cordless phones away, etc)   
Note that you cannot get 100Mbit/s throughput on a 100Mbit/s port. To measure 100Mbit/s throughput, everything must use GigE ports and cat5e or cat6 cabling. 
On a 100Mbit/s port, you'd be lucky to get more than 75 Mbit/s throughput. 
The Thomspon modem has GigE ports. Your new Ethernet card hopefully should as well. Make sure the connecting cable is cat5e or cat6 (written on the cable).   
Secondly: 100M fiberpower uses multiple bundled DOCSIS upstream and downstream channels. This greater demand on available channels means you are more likely to suffer problems if the cabling from the local node to your apartment wall socket is not perfect. The types of problems and types of interference that can exist are extensive and numerous. Right down to: an innocent neighbour may have a cable problem, which injects interference into the cable network, which interferes with exactly your wanted DOCSIS signal. I went to a course once where all this was explained and demonstrated - it is amazing the types of problems that can occur.   
So history shows that 90% of all problems exist in the subscriber's own   building.   
So my guess is (in order of likeliness) 
a) old, incapable wiring in the building/apartment 
b) old wall sockets 
c) damaged cable modem cable to wall socket 
d) defective cable modem 
e) wrong ethernet cable 
f) wifi interference (if using wifi)   
A process of elimination will quickly have you sorted.   
Don't play with modem firmware, the cable modem will have specific firmware loaded by the network operator, which will be a known good version   
Good luck!

In fact the ""raccordement"" thing they try to sell you is when they can't connect your line to the one going to your flat.   
Ex: Bob previous tenant had phone 022123456. The line was ""connected"" so even when he left they simply switched off the service. But the lines are still connected.   
In your case they don't know what line will go to your flat, and try to make you pay.   
But to connect the line they will give you a ""technical reference"" (such as 55 or whatever specific). You simply need to go into the building room with all the cables for everyone.   
They will be displayed the 55 there. Now the trick is to find out which one is going to your flat.   
Guess what probably all your neighboors have a phone/internet already connected so your's is the unconnected one.   
To actually test its deadly simple: take a phone and connect it on your landline plug, in your flat.   
Take that cable from 55 and simply make it touch the empty socket you suspect's the one going to your flat. 
Keep the contact or screw it (it's all simple to do there's everything). Ring your landline number. ask a mate to stay home and listen. 
 If it rings on your landline, bingo you found the empty cable you need to connect. If not ring, try to make it touch to another empty socket, ring again.   
Bingo you saved 180chf. for a few minutes guess work.

Over 160 channels to chose from including many English-language channels.  At the moment, Swisscom is offering two months free subscription to new subscribers.  Check out their website.

			Can't talk about Sunrise, but my Cablecom internet seems to die whenever I am on Skype. The rest of the time it is awful, but the problem seems to become worse when I am using Skype. I'm not sure if it's the wifi router or the actual cablecom internet. Sorry I'm not much help, but you have my sympathy. I'm pulling my hair out because my parents are clueless about internet and don't understand why ""I go away"" when we talk on Skype.

			The key point to be aware of is that you'll struggle to find a ""rolling contract"" of the type I suspect you're thinking of in Switzerland, as in a ""monthly rolling contract"". They are typically 12- or 24-month contracts, and if not cancelled in time roll into another 12 or more month contract.    
For a six-month stay, you should really opt for prepaid, i.e. pay-as-you-go. As others have said, details and prices are being discussed elsewhere on the forum.

			Hi, I am watching tv online via Cucirca   . It has a 72 minute limit on it and then you have to wait 30 minutes.    
It says by pressing play, then pause, waiting for the buffering to stop, go offline and then watch the episode you can avoid the 72 minute limit but somehow I can't get it to work, I do the above but then it still says I have reached the 72 minute limit. I am watching on a MacBook Pro.   
Any ideas?

Indeed Swisscom TV is an option, but is also dependent on local infrastructure, which is not ""certain"".

			Swisscom have just refunded me 319.85 due to a change of policy without informing me. 
I am over the border in DE / FR on a regular basis and receive mails etc. Last year I signed up for 2chf per MB however in December & without giving details with the invoice made a 24 hour deal of 7chf for 10 MB however by 1.1 MB your charged 7chf. 
I only realised as whilst in Basel near St Louis, my emails cost me 7 chf's, there is a problem with a mast so very little Swisscom signal.   
They have put me back on the 2chf per MB deal, however I won't be bothering as I can get internet in any country for 0.59 euro per MB with abroadband.

			It might be hard to believe, but telemarketers are people as well  
People with an unfotunate and yes quite annoying profession. 
Politely decline whatever they are offering, say a quick goodbye and hang up before they can get a word in. 
No need to be rude, these people know the score, from 100 calls they are likely to get one positive lead. 
Its a hard way to make money and I wouldnt do it for quids. 
In my opinion being rude, juvenile or a smart ass says a lot more about yourself than the telemarketer......

- all local calls are charged additional 19c? is it for first min for each call? 
- Same applicable for international call? 
- Lebara to Lebara is mentioned 0 with asterix, the asterix says 0.39 cents. its one time charge for first minute for each call?

			If you're moving into an apartment block (like most of us) it depends on what the block is wired up to receive. Swisscom or Cablecom usually.   
It's pretty quick to get service laid on so I wouldn't panic about it. You probably have more pressing things to worry about if you're emigrating.

			Hello, 
I am using Tango - free app from store, which can use both cameras on my SGS 2. Tried just on wifi with friend with another SGS 2 (yes, it's such a good phone  ), and works like a charm.  
And as for speed - video requires tremendous amount of bandwidth, compared to voice (compare mp3s with movies, just for an example). And of course low-latency connection. I wouldn't expect much without wifi out of it, or on a place with excellent 3G connection.

			Another relatively dissatisfied Orange customer here. While their international calling charges  great - their data network is appalling and I'm noticing more and more holes in the voice network every day. They say they're investing millions in the network at the moment - but I'd have a hard time recommending them to anyone right now.   
Swisscom will bill you by the hour for a call to a fixed line in CH. Then services like 10787.ch can hook you up to Italy or the UK (landlines) for a couple of rappen. This should make things a little cheaper. When I could choose three numbers with orange, I used 10787 as one and and this worked fine for me until I changed to a 90 minute orange Me price plan.

			The links you sent are about constructing the infrastructure, not the end user offers. Checked Sunrise: they offer only ADSL and ISDN (and mobile of course).   
I have found offers in Bern, Schaffhausen and Zug, and prices are little higher than Cablecom, but most likely the quality is better.

I think texts were free too. Meteor mobile was the funniest operator I have seen, they would occasionally loose the whole network covering Dublin.   
In Switzerland I've been amazed that despite spending a great deal of money with them Orange are just not interested in giving me free stuff. With Orange UK I could phone up and ask for any new handset, even half way through the year and they used to send it to me FOC. I have actually had to PAY for a handset in Switzerland, it's insane.

I also need a new mobile - In switz do they have pay as go or are contracts better if I want to buy an iphone? Do they have an apple shop anywhere near Montreux?   
Also I have never worked in Switzerland before, this will be my first job there - will it be difficult for me to get an iphone on contract because I have no credit in Switzerland?   
Any help would be very much appreciated.. I'm not very tech savvy!

			Hi 
I will shortly arrive in CH and need to get my BB asap on a network as it will be a while before I will get home DSL and need my email working 24/7,  
I have seen the good prices from Sunrise but do they have good reception, I will be working in Zurich centre but will probably want to take time to travel around the country too, I have already discounted Orange based on the feedback I found on this forum. 
So my question is should I save money or just pay more with Swisscom and be happier with the reception for GPRS (I have a BB Curve 8520 no 3G) 
thanks

(It's a limitation of the chip design in the phone It only has one receiver  and that will never change.). This is the same as CDMA in the USA. If the phone starts a calls when there is an active data connection then the phone can decide to bump the data connection and let the voice call through. But if the call is incoming then the network must decide to bump the data connection. With both Orange and Sunrise in CH this is not happening. And given the rubbish state of both carriers 3G networks, this amounts to huge amount of missed calls when you phone drops to the 2G network....

			A long shot but my Gigaset phone has stopped charging and I can't tell if the problem is the phone or the charger, does anyone in zurich have one and could lend me their charge station for 5 minutes to see?   
or alternatively anyone not in Zurich with a voltmeter could let me know what the charger is putting out, mine only puts out 2v though the transformer lists 5v.

As I said on posting #3 you have to get the local TV company to wire you up to the street box. Swisscom do not do cabling! And I am not sure that Cablecom do either.    
Have I explained it well enough?

The recorder can be either built into the TV (check if your TV has a built-in recorder, some do) or a separate external device.   
The external recorder can be a recorder of your own choice, chosen to integrate into your TV setup according to your needs and desires and price bracket.   
How you connect your recorder depends on the connection capabilities of your TV system.

			I noticed a huge difference between a pay and non-paid skype connection, make of that what you will.   
Paid - Never an Issue 
Unpaid - Constant drop outs   
Hmm, I would say some traffic prioritisations going on.    
Internet speed is rarely anything to do with how new/fast/shiny the computer is. Common misconception. Yes if you clog it up with junk it will have an affect, but in 20 years of working/dealing with IT I've seen maybe x3 occasions of where the PC is at fault. Usually virus related.   
Saying this I have seen poor DNS setups on the ISP end this can cause internet dropouts.

			Hiya,   
can anybody help me? swisscom is very expensive, and cablecom has a lot of issues. I've heard it from many people...   
A swiss friend recommended me sunrise, but I am not sure, if that a good option is... I've read many complaints in internet.......   
I only need a 1 or 2 MB internet connection. Nothing more....     
merci vielmals

I find that really weird, yet this isn't the first time I've heard this. Wow.   
Maybe I'm just too friendly and pay the bills   at least I don't live in fear of Billag Man... I actually enjoy watching the TV, and although I admit it IS expensive, other taxes seem quite reasonable compared to neighbouring countries. Swings...roundabouts...   
(Although I have nothing but contempt for Billags customer service and the obstacles they place to prevent you from righting their wrongs. It's often easier to pay the bloody bills than contest unfair billings. Swine!)

			Our Cablecom Digital TV picture quality has degraded quite badly over the last few days in 8008. Has anyone else started getting poor picture quality ?   
Have done the basic checks. Reset the boxes, checked cable connections , reseated everything etc. DVD playback is fine and TV is quite new so I do not suspect the TV to be at fault.

			i signed up for swisscom-TV last January, one month later I went to the swisscom shop to terminate the contract (within the trial period), and return the equipment at the same time.   
Last February I still received a TV bill. I inquired the shop and got informed that I still need to pay it for the whole year, as that is the minimum duration of the contract. Afterwards I can get my money back. OK, I continued my payment without arguing.    
Now it has been one year and is the time to collect the money. I inquired again and was told that I will be refunded monthly by subtracting the overcharge from my bill, since I have other service from swisscom. In fact I am thinking of changing a provider now, but apparently I still have to be bonded with swisscom for a while, if I want my money back.   
I am not sure if this is a typical case or just a mishandling on me. Just want to recommend a second thought to those who are considering to give swisscom-TV a try.

			So in case anyone ever finds themselves in the same situation - it's possible to buy additional Swisscom credit online using your credit card.       
It's pretty easy - took about half an hour from the time I bought credit to the time I got a text back from Swisscom saying they'd unblocked my account.   
Mods, you can lock this one up.

You still need to adhere to your old provider's contract termination clause and have all your bills paid before the new provider can port your number over.

			I currently have Swisscom TV for 30 CHF per month, and get something like 140 channels. But I have an old satellite TV decoder and dish sitting around that I bought around 2004. I tried then to get some Scandanavian channels on Thor 2/3 but gave up because to buy a subscription was expensive and complicated. I had it pointed at another sat for a little while that had some free-to-air channels, but it wasn't worth it and I took it all down and stuck it in the basement.   
I was thinking to set it up and give it a try again, but I'm not sure whats a good sat to point it at?          
Any recommendations? I know Astra/Hotbird is the most popular, but since I'm already getting Swisscom TV, I guess it's all the same channels basically?    
I'd be interested still in Scandinavian or Russian channels, or anything else anyone recommends for english/russian speakers? That's either FTA or a subscription can be easily gotten?    
(I mention Scandinavian becasue they usually just do subtitles for movies, and there's some good sports (hockey) on there as well  )

			Reason is that it is supposed to act like your office line or something. So your company can have it configured so you dial short numbers like office extension numbers from your mobile. With mine I can also dial a zero first as if it was 0 for an outside line. For example if I wanna dial a Zurich nmber I'd dial 0044 xxx xx xx. For international calls like calling France it'd be 00033 xx xx xx xx etc.   
Putting the international code using the + format just ensures that you are actually dialling that telephone number instead of a local CMN number.   
Maybe there's some more information on Swisscom's website.

The problem I have experienced on my (4 yr. old) Dell Inspiron laptop (running XP), is that within a few minutes of starting a program, my CPU max.'s out at 100%, and the video stream just slows down, jumps and eventually locks.   
This is using the free non-sub. option on both the stand alone downloaded version and through a browser.   
This could well be a problem at my end, though, as I have experienced similar with other streamed video feeds.

			When the power supply for my Acer Aspire 1640 notebook began to give trouble, I bought a 90 watt 'Notebook Power Adapter' for 59 CHF 
from PC-Hai in Zürich. It can be used for a variety of different makes of notebook by means of 10 different connectors, 4 of which are specifically for Dell. It works fine with my Acer. Fortunately it appears that all notebooks require the same 19 volt power. There is also another model which can supply 120 watts, but costs over 100 CHF.

			Yes it is via the coxial/high def cable. No need for your telephone jack with Cablecom. 
You have a jack on your wall with 2 regular outputs and one narrow. The narrow one is for cable internet. The digital phone connection is then connected to your router. The two other outputs on the wall are then for TV and radio.

			Well, I hope you will get it sorted out...   
Make sure you find someone reasonable who will pick up the phone in Justitia and they will ask you to write your side of the story. Then try to get evidence from Orange in form of history of your account.   
I dealt with Justitia lately over unpaid UPS bill which they mistakenly billed me twice and even despite my intervention with the UPS themselves, agent still insisted I must pay it. After exchange of few emails, there was silence and I thought the whole matter was settled. Not until debt collecting agency sent me the letter.   
I stayed calm, picked up a phone and called Justitia and explained to them the whole thing about mistake being made in English. The lady on the other side was very helpful and asked me to write my ""opinion"" i.e. side of the story.   
All I can say try to track it down to detail, explain what happened and only can hope that eventually you will get it right.

@peterg are you using swisscom or someone else?[/QUOTE]   
I'm not using any Swiss company. I'm not really using a mobile phone at all here, apart from occasional text messages on my UK T-Mobile phone. I have a work mobile for personal emergency I suppose, but so far I've not found much need for a mobile here.

But: Kindle. You really do not need to buy the Amazon-locks-you-in device, there are ""open"" ones from Sony and others. My boss has a Sony one and it looks very nice - since it supports multiple formats, you can buy your books at various websites - and there are apparently even libraries ""lending"" e-books by now.

			I am one of the first FON subscribers in Spain (where the idea was generated). There, although the idea is/was very cool, not many people use it. I've had a hotspot for about 6-7 years now and I think noone has connected to it yet... And I live quite near a hotel, in a town center of a turistic area. Not many neighbours, though.   
However, I used FON connections in different countries such as the UK, Japan and Korea, but you can't really go somewhere and think you'll have internet in these places.   
You can only use remote FONs without paying if you're sharing your current connection for free (same for others).   
Anyway, the router is a good deal for the price and it seem to be growing in many places (in some countries they have agreements with big public Wireless providers, which can be an advantage).   
Google about it and take your pick.

I find that really weird, yet this isn't the first time I've heard this. Wow.   
Maybe I'm just too friendly and pay the bills   at least I don't live in fear of Billag Man... I actually enjoy watching the TV, and although I admit it IS expensive, other taxes seem quite reasonable compared to neighbouring countries. Swings...roundabouts...   
(Although I have nothing but contempt for Billags customer service and the obstacles they place to prevent you from righting their wrongs. It's often easier to pay the bloody bills than contest unfair billings. Swine!)

Some carriers will let you unlock your phone after you've had it for a certain amount of time. They may also have a special dispensation since you left the UK. They may also charge a fee for it.

			Apparently it depends on which type and make of box you have. In my case (a grey mediabox recorder), I had to flip open the flap on the front left of the box and hold down two buttons at the same time. I think it was a green (or a red?) button plus the left arrow.     : I would not recommend doing this on your own. Give Cablecom a call so they can talk you through it.

They shut down my service at least one month after the card change and did not resume service until I gave them the new card number.

			Do not put up with this.  I had the exact same problem (zurich) - did not fix itself within about 3 weeks.  I called them up and arranged to replace the box - upgraded to the HD box, which even on the normal channels seems to give a clearer picture and more reliable operation, although certainly not fault-free.

			You should first check on the cablecom website if you have a cablecom connection in the building or not.   
I think for cablecom you only need a cable socket in the wall. Usually this is in the hall. Cablecom provides you a modem where there is a internet phone port. There you connect the phone to work. There are no cablecon phone socket on the wall as such.

			This will depend upon what you mean by will it work.    
Sony are a little bit funny with their TVs and if you get the long model number you will see that it is something like KDL-40W4000U. The last letter relates to the region the TV is designed for, where U is the UK and and E would be Europe. The only difference between the two is that a European TV has a cable decoder in there, the UK one does not.   
Therefore, if you want to plug TV directly into your cable socket in the wall of your apartment it is not going to work.    
As mentioned by the other posters, there are ways to make the TV work. Basically if you have any set top box, be that sky, freeview, cablecom, or who ever else is providing the service in your area, these will connect to the TV through a scart or HDMI cable, all of which will work.    
The basic analogue cable connections are providing fewer and fewer channels as they push digital tv, which requires a set top box, and as mentioned cablecom's 6,- a month offering is pretty good.    
So there should be no problem bringing over the TV, just don't plug it directly into the cable outlet in the wall.

			My friend who lives in St.Gallen also told me he was having the same problem as I kept asking me if the quality was improving and he said the quality was so so.  
Hardware I do not think there should be not a  problem because it is the same computer I was using in 2009. I honestly do not know why some people get better quality then others. As to not getting high speed connection during peek times could be a reason as I can only watch the NFL matches late in the evening or on weekends.   
Yes the American Ads are quite cool and sometimes very funny but I like the archived games as the games last around 120 Mins (When there is OT) 
but is extremely difficult to avoid finding out the scores when you watch archived matches, as I had to have complete sports blackout from this Monday until Tuesday evening so not to find out the score for the NFC and AFC championship games. 
But Superbowl I will watch live on Bluewin TV as last year I was watching the Superbowl on BBC (via Satellite) and I lost the signal (do not know the reason the satellite signal become unstable around winter time). So fingers crossed, by the way which is your favorite team and which team will you be supporting in the Superbowl ?

			I was going to cancel my Swisscom Mobile Unlimited package and go for a Sunrise or Orange data stick. After reviewing this extensively, I ended up sticking with Swisscom. Why?   
- The Sunrise network SUCKS. The 3G coverage is about 1/5 of that of Swisscom - just check out the network coverage maps 
- Orange doesn't have EDGE. Outside their (minimalistic) 3G network, the data stick becomes unusable. 
- With Swisscom, you can use WiFi networks all over the place - it's included in your data flat package. The other providers don't offer WiFi.    
Waiting for the merger to happen doesn't make too much sense. 1st of all it'll take until May until the anti-trust agency will decide whether they can merge at all. And if they can, it'll be another year or so until the networks are interconnected. By then, my contract will have run out and I can re-evaluated.   
And last but not least: the price difference between Swisscom's top-notch network and the ridiculously bad coverage of Sunrise and Orange is a mere 10 Fr. per month. Not worth the trouble, if you ask me. I'm paying 59 Fr. now for the data flat + free WiFi all over the country, including on trains etc.

 - was previously always unreliable, recently replaced with HD box - seems more stable but still has glitches 
 - with old box almost never got local zurich channel, although it was listed - now it always seems to be available 
 - new box almost never gets UK channel 5 - it seems to be available for a few minutes on the occasional evening 
 - certainly used to get disruption during bad weather - i think that still happens, but not really noticed recently

I may try and slipstream some of these changes into my installation but this will take time to sort out.

			I have the Nokia 6220 with browser function (works fine, I use it for map.search.ch, sbb.ch, zvv.ch and mailing) and Navigation software (built in, also works abroad) 
I got it with a 12 month contract for 100.- or so a year ago, and I am quite happy with the GPS function. It works with about 5-10 Meter accuracy, often even better. 
If you want to use the built-in voice navigation etc you'll have to pay for that after 3 months or so. I use a Sunrise Zero 25 subscription with 7.-/M Internet usage of 700mb. Don't underestimate the data transfer when using GPS for map details, so only get a subscription where you have enough bandwith, otherwise it gets very costly...

			A cool bit of bodging from this bored genius    
He's created a wireless visual interface for Sony's PS3 console. The purpose? To transmit signals to and from the PS3 by way of this handy handheld. A 1.2GHz wireless transmitter is used to get the controller commands to the PS3, and the same is used in reverse to get the video signals from the console to the homegrown device.

Billag has to be paid just for owning a TV, or now it seems even a PC that can access on-line music or video content. Also a licence is required for having a radio, including the car radio.   
Through the cable already in your apartment you will get some channels which you can plug straight into the TV.  The channels will vary depending on location etc...   
Options to obtain more channels are:   
Cable Com - If available in you building, otherwise your local cabel provider.  Goto the cablecome website and punch in your address and you'll see if they service your area. 
Bluewin TV - With this you need to have ADSL from Swisscom i.e. over the phone line, therefore available everywhere. 
Satellite - If you can put a dish up, or have a south facing balcony, if yes do this, then buy a 'FreeSat HD PVR' box in the UK.   Many companies will ship here.

			This thread has been handy for me as well, to get some good ideas - coming from a place where the tel-cos are desperate for your business, they have super package deals so they get all of your business (and that of your friends & family...). When I walked into Swisscom and asked if they had a package for home phone, internet and two mobile phones, the guy looked as if I'd grown three extra heads.   
The Migros option looks good to me as well, since my wife & I have been running pre-paid mobiles for years in Australia now, with international roaming (used to visit Rome and Singapore in the past, now used as a stop-gap for Switzerland)... so pre-paid looks the way to go and, as others have said, the handsets themselves are cheap. Being able to check and top-up your balance online is a bonus, in my view...

			I'm told that Fuji and Pioneer make the highest quality plasmas, but you do have to pay for it ... I bought a 50"" Pioneer and it has been outstanding.  Comparing it side-by-side with LG/Samsung/Panasonic etc in the shop, you can really see the difference.   
That said, I don't have two side-by-side TVs in my living room and I suspect I'd be just as happy with another brand, but with a few kilofrancs still in my pocket.   
In any case, it's probably sensible to think of your purchase on a 3-4 year timescale (max!), because by then you're going to want   -- they should be large enough and have come down in price to an affordable level.

			I'm afraid you are stuck with Cablecom for the moment. That's 'monopoly' for you.   
The 3 month clause is in the small print.   
If and when you leave the country, they let you off the contract.

Artronic is a small shop that does a good job...but I wouldn't expect them to speak English...   
Although they do speak German...and of course French...   
They did ours.  They were very helpful and friendly.   
You can find them on the main road that runs through the middle of Saint-Louis.  Just follow that road towards LeClerc (old Rond Point).

			Not a phone card, but did you ever try out Skype or Jajah? Both require internet (so nothing for ""on the road""), but in short:   
Skype (  Rate to India 20Rp/Min.; You need a headset and the skype software on your computer; highspeed internet of at least 1000/100 recommended to get good phone quality.   
Jajah (  Rate to India 7,8Rp/Min.; You don't need any software, just type in your number and the others party number and you get the callback immediately. No need of highspeed internet, because your phone gets called.   
Hope this information helps anyway.

			There is a very small (and I mean small) chance, that you can dispute it.   
For the AGB's to be valid in German law, there are a few conditions that must be met.   
1: ""Widerrufsbelehrung"" must be visible in the AGB's, so that you can not miss it when you scroll over the text. It is in fact not in the AGB itself but a seperate point right next to the AGB's, and the ""Widerrufsbelehrung itself is framed and extra big headline, so I doubt, that it will be valid, but it may be worth a try.       
Das OLG Frankfurt a.M. hat darauf hingewiesen, dass eine   in Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen nur dann eingebettet werden kann, wenn dies in der gesetzlich geforderten hervorgehobenen und deutlich gestalteten Form erfolgt. Die von der Antragsgegnerin verwendete Widerrufsbelehrung sei, neben einer unzureichenden Link-Kennzeichnung, zu beanstanden, weil sie zu unauffällig in die Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen eingebettet sei.   
A rough Translation:     
2: For the AGB's to be valid, there must be an option to download and save them, and that is missing. That is probably your better chance to dispute it.   
I have looked it up before and succesfully disputed an online subscription 1 year ago, but can not find the link anymore. I am pretty sure, it was somewhere on this webpage though:        
Doc.   
Edit: added a rough translation of the german part. German legal language is difficult to translate, but hope it is reasonably understandable.

			I live in a four storey house and due to all the reinforced concrete, I've difficulty getting a signal one story up or down from the wireless router!  ( Wireless technology seems to have been designed for the US market rather than the Swiss - US houses have less RF absorbing materials   ).     
The solution I've gone for is networking over the power lines.  The router is connected via standard network cabling to a power network adaptor.  On the other floors, we connect the computers to additional power network adaptors.  It works fine, and it was cheaper and more reliable than using a repeater/booster.   
In your case, set up a receiver at the sweet point, and then convert to a network over power from there.  Network adaptors can usually be set to use decent encryption, so your network traffic is secure.

I used to store everything on these video's, but have moved to the ext HD, with a USB into a PS3 - makes for easier viewing now.    
$50 or $60 for a 500Gb Ext HD....is this from the US and A?

Otherwise they are slower and wait for the item, then send it to you 2 days after.

			h thanks for all the replies, humax appears popular, i have had a look at a few.     
ABfab, i thought it was terrestrial, as she told me he undid her satillite, but the tv is very new, so from your comments about inbuilt receivers, and knowing she had a box, i called her, and she has no idea whats she's conneceted to only she has 4 irish chanels on her normal tv control and has to switch to AV and her box for the others, and her box is called sat4 free so I was heading the wrong way guess she is satilite, so thanks for putting doubt in my mind on that one. 
she can record any 1 programme, but cannot watch another at the same time, but if i buy one of these new boxes, will she still have the same problem, if some chanels are on sat and some on tv ??

They do docking stations withe alarm clocks, with CD players and just speakers. 
There may also be a general 10% off this Thursday at Interdiscount - I got a tip-off today that this is the case at the Interdiscount in Affoltern.

			If it helps... a bit of history...   
BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel 4, Channel 5 are the original terrestrial channels in the UK (i.e. available via normal antenna). The rest like BBC3-4, ITV2-4, More 4, etc. have always been digital channels (i.e. available only via cable/satellite/digital terrestrial).   
The original terrestrial channels are the ""prime"" channels of the respective companies and normally are the channels that broadcast the news for/up to date shows, etc. The digital destined channels generally show repeats of shows, specific series, genres, etc.

I still love my Hero and I'm about to sell my iPhone 3G S. The HTC is massively more customizable, runs apps in the background and in my opinion has the better browser (centering in on text works perfectly)

It's easy enough to spot when it's happening, as websites which normally appear almost instantaneously suddenly download into your browser in three or four chunks and the iTunes store takes forever to load. It's as though you've suddenly switched to a dial-up connection.   
Just in case I've had a look on Google anyway and couldn't find anything, plus there's nothing on cablemodem.ch about that either, and those guys are usually pretty quick to spot that kind of thing.

			To add to this, the fact it support PAL means virtually nothing. If you are connecting a HD source then the concept of PAL/NTSC has (barring a very detailed technical explanation) gone.   
From what you describe, the only issue you will have is the power and even then you can get a transformer to convert the power down to 110V.

I didn't want to spend too much money on it because I always thought that the next car we buy was going to have its own SatNav system.    
So got a new car end of last year but the SatNav, which costs almost Fr.3000 is absolutely rubbish. Much prefer my old Tom Tom. On top of that the updates costs Fr.300 a pop, which is about 10x more than the Tom Tom updates!

Also the decoding will be the same. The only thing you would need to switch of in case of a satellite receiver is the power supply for the LNA... ut again, I am not sure thats why I posted the question    
I am wondering whether the only difference between the two is the label on the box....

As far as contrast ratios of over 3000 they aren't real.  The 100,000:1 numbers you get are derived by comparing the maximum brightness output to the minimum brightness output.  Basically full on versus full off.  This isn't how monitors work so it isn't relevant and if you watch modern display devices at full contrast with auto iris/dynamic contrast it looks like ****!

So far I have been quite happy with the service. Received a defective DVD once and they replaced it without additional charge. Blu Ray selection is not bad either.   
I decided Frisbi is better. Can't remember why though... something to do with the charges if you return the DVDs early or something like that.

If you want Cablecom Digital then you'll pay 6 francs or more per month extra, depending on the set-top-box you want/need.

			Hi all, 
    I was thinking to ask some support from people living in Switzerland, with one nice idea that is spreading a lot, in the world of iPhone...   
Some months ago a company started producing iPhone apps, with the rule of 10% donation: that is, from all that is coming from AppStore, 10% is donated to projects of several non-profit small associations.   
The idea is great, I feel, and the first app is already one of the top-seller for outdoor sports:  , the best GPS tracker, really!   
This require alternative channels to spread the concept, not millionaire adv campaings! For this reason, if you have an idea to help the project, please write me here! 
thank you!!!

i saw a deal while browsing on live - something like $3.25 a month and got in to sign up and it would only allow a US address, therefore only a US cc. then i chickened out using my US cc for fear of being IP blocked.    
christian, for the ebay or amazon are you suggesting the US or Euro sites?     
EDIT: i found the subscriptions cards on toppreise, it states FR/DE, but does this have anything to do with the actual xbox live? i mean, i don't want to sign up and be locked into FR or DE xbox live menus.

Swisscom does offer the blackberry service and I think it costs about 10.- a month which includes a fair amount of traffic for your emails etc. But you do have to sign a contract...

			From what I can remember, you can't play games from Asia on Euro PAL machines.    
I was looking at some PS3 games and PSP games in Australia, and teh region coding meant that they would not run on my machines,    
HOWEVER, PS2 games are different, as they are able to run.   
With the Wii, I wuld think that the same applies. It is best to play safe, and get the Euro games for a Euro machine.   
The alternative is to actually buy a Asian Wii, and then you should not have any issues, but obviously there is a cost involved.   
Hope that this helps.

as you can see, in theory based on Spreading Factors, you can have one guy using the whole bandwidth (SF1), or 16 people taking smaller pieces of it (SF16). The network should automatically scale you to the best connection available.

Maybe the press have stopped shilling for Apple by stating that jailbroken iPhones are all vulnerable.  They finally admitted or pointed out that the user has to actually install SSH themselves before this vulnerability exists.   
Still, SSH is pretty cool as it allows you to directly add and remove things from your iPhone.  Of course, as with all computer things, you had better know what you are doing.  Or you will be SOL.   
Good Luck,

			Hi All,    
Just moved in  and trying to get TV working (was told by agent that i have Cablecom cable connection). Tuning didn't help ( i've read  in dif topic that this because TV i bought in UK has different frequency)    
I ordered UPC MediaBox (Thomson i think)      
but nothing happened, it just dos not start, not react to remote etc ( it says update can take up to 30 minutes, but 6 hours later same story)    
Also, there is Media adapter, that goes with Mediabox     
but it does not fit my socket, which is completely different     
so i connected Mediabox just using areal cable   
I would appreciate any advise

I am also with Cablecom, and just tried to do an ipconfig, and also get an IP Address, 77.56.x.x but with Subnet Mask 255.255.252.0, and yesterday, I did not have Internet Access briefly, but looked like i was connected.

Gues they have just no clue what they do in there...    
Maybe the following will work for you:   
1: Connect your old Siemens router to the cable modem 
2: Connect the new Zyxel router to the old Siemens router, and make sure the Zyxel is not multihomed 
3: Put the Zyxel WAN IP in the DMZ of the Siemens, and you may be able to get your IP Phone working that way   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Feb 2006	Groaned at 35 Times in 28 Posts	Completely foxed by Cablecom networking ...	dino	Posts: 1,663

They indicate that your computer should have come with a DVI adapter.   
That is the best and almost only way to interface your computer with your TV.   
If you have the DVI adapter from when you bought your laptop then you just take the adapter into MediaMart and ask for however much extra length you need.  You can run S-video up to 15 meters with no problem and 20 meters shouldn't be a big issue.  Any more than that starts to cause problems with the video signal.   
If you don't have the adapter you could try Fust at Globus stores, as they carry Apple adapters.  (At least in Lausanne, they do.)   
Good Luck,

			I have various video capture devices for my computers, and some of them even do what they are meant to do, but most of the video tapes I want to digitize are in S-VHS format, also known as Super VHS. My very expensive S-VHS recorder kicked the bucket and is way beyond repair.    
Even used S-VHS recoders are very difficult to find, and new ones aren't manufactured any more. Considering the quality od my tapes, I don't want to sacrifice them to a questionable machine bought on eBay. Professional conversion is expensive, and the result isn't exactly overwhelming. I spent a lot of money testing several companies, with pretty disappointing results. They may be fine for ordinary VHS, but not for S-VHS. I truly don't know what to do.

			I have an Acer DX900 Dual SIM phone. The dual SIM function works well and beats carrying around two phones. It has GPS, WLAN and 3G. I use it a lot for internet access although the text size is way too small for me on most websites even with the largest size selected. Battery life is poor, but it can be topped up from a USB port or a 12v Car Charger for a Blackberry.     
This is probably my last Windows Mobile device. For me, Windows Mobile falls short of my high expectation of reliability for a phone OS. I needed dual(tri) SIM and WLAN so my options were limited. Despite this I am going to invest in some mapping software to make the GPS a little more useful when I am out out of cell service range.   
Luton Airport has a vending machine that sells PAYG SIM cards from various telcos around the world at reasonable prices. Other airports may have the same.

			I haven't tried popcorn hour, but I've heard it's a great system.   
I have been backing up my collection of DVD's in Ubuntu using a program called K9copy      
I copy them directly as a DVD iso and then play that iso file using an excellent program called VLC,   available for both windows and Ubuntu. One advantage of copying my DVDs this way is I can get rid of all the ads etc at the beginning and make a file where the movie plays immediately. Plus, I can keep extra audio tracks like commentary. Of course, since I am just copying the DVD file, the files are huge.   
For storage I can highly recommend a NAS, the DNS-323. It has a wide support community and works well. You buy the NAS, and the two hard drives it can hold and put it on the network. The nice thing about a NAS is they are like external hard drives but once on your home network, every computer in the house can copy and backup to the NAS. Plus the DNS-323 supports UPnP which means you can use something like popcorn hour to stream programs from the NAS directly to the TV. However, you'd probably have to encode the DVD copy into an avi or something.   
Of course, this is a rather technical solution... but efforts to make easy legal DVD digital backup solutions have been roadblocked (check out this legal effort  , or this link in wikipedia:  )

			As the others said, the CD is not useful unless you want to connect your modem on the USB port. Use the Ethernet cable and you're all set.   
As additional software there is some kind of diagnostic software (not very useful though) that you can download anyway from their website.

			Hi,   
I wonder how a company is allowed to fleece its customers this way in the so-called developed world. Anyway, I had the same problem with the modem and the fix is the following:   
(a) Does your computer have inbuilt wireless? If so, then forget that USB modem. It is only for older computers with no inbuilt WLAN.    
(b) While setting up the Gigaset, you need to provide information about your service provider. There is usually the choice between ""Cablecom"" and ""Other"". You would have logically chosen ""Cablecom"". Unfortunately, that's the wrong choice if you want to make the modem work. Trust Cablecom to provide such a product.   
Finally, I assume that you made the following connection (wired) while setting things up. Cablecom modem -> Gigaset -> your computer LAN socket.   
Once you have gone through the painful process of configuring your Gigaset, including going to the advanced settings options and turning wireless ON explicitly, you will be able to work with the WLAN. But Siemens products are equally horrible, and so you will need to make a coffee break between every 2 steps of the configuration process.   
And beware! Try not to interrupt the configuration process by going back or closing the browser. If you do that, the wonderful Gigaset configuration will likely never appear again, showing you just a blank screen. I normally turn OFF my WLAN because I use the wired mode in most cases, and since the last time I turned the WLAN ON, it is in ON mode, as I cannot find a way to make the Gigaset configuration appear anymore........

			Although I hope you've found a solution to your problem here are my two cents:   
1. Any quad-band (read almost 95% of phones bought in Europe) will work on AT&T or T-Mobile in the US.    
2. Have your iPhone unlocked and use it in the US.     
If your iPhone is not upgraded to the newest firmware which is OS 3.1 and above unlocking your phone will be a piece of cake. PM me and I'll let you in on the details. You don't even have to be a tech junkie to figure it out.    
3. Get a pay monthly account which is NOT a contract.    
Only recently, T-Mobile has started offering service which are prepaid to some extent. As you may already know receiving as well as making calls within the US eats your minutes. If you go with pre pay it will kill your minutes and additional minutes are expensive to come by (I think $0.45 per min). Now depending on how long and how frequently you plan on staying in the US I suggest you sign up for a T-Mobile flex pay account. It will give you a number and all the services of a normal contract while not being one. No Social Security Number needed and you can give any address in the US. You pay in advance for the month of service (yes it is on a month to month cycle) and you will have service for one calender month. If you do not pay for the next month your line will be suspended. A line can be suspended up to 30 days. You can downgrade or upgrade to any plan during any month at no additional fee. For a fee of about $40 you will get around 1000 minutes (for receiving and calling) with unlimited weekends (free domestic calls between Friday 9pm to Monday 6am). Last I checked it was $6.99 for unlimited nights during the weekdays (from 9pm to 6am), 19.99 combined for unlimited data and domestic text messaging (and YES it works with the iPhone although you have to convince T-Mobile you are not using an iPhone - not really a big issue). The best part of course was unlike Europe the data is uncapped so you can make free Skype calls and unlimited browsing over the T-Mobile network without having to worry about overages. Oh and there is a $20 SIM fee if you get pre pay and if you get flex pay they might give it to you for free. I myself have been a T-Mobile customer for 5 years and online research will prove that they are the highest ranked provider for customer satisfaction in the US for cell phone service. For around $82 for the month I had 1000 minutes for nights and weekends and unlimited data and text. You pretty much don't need to pay anything additional. Again if you don't think you'll be spending that many minutes you can opt for a smaller plan. Although be careful if you're going to be in the Manhattan and frequently in the high rise buildings your coverage may be spotty. Anything above the 35th floor is a 50/50. Again this in my opinion is a better option than a pre paid service.    
I hope that helps. If you need any further clarification/help please do let me know.

			For all of you out there using a PDA: I recently placed an online order for a battery and a battery charger for my PDA from  . Delivery was quick, but the charger didn't match with the battery. I complained instantly per e-mail and asked for replacement. No answer. A week later, I wrote again. It's now over two weeks and I still don't have an answer. Also, there is no phone number to be found. Strange! I think there is a system hehind such behavior. My statement about such a bad customer service is confirmed by various other forum entries. See  and  .

			One good reason for not downloading FREE AV programs! 
Stick to the real names or atleast type the web site in yourself, but be warned, I have found a Free AVG site (not the original) but the program actually installs spyware during the install, says the program did not install correctly, please reboot, reinstall software, installation failed and when you try to uninstall it, it will not.

			an easy and practical way to watch any tv show ( i.e. jay leno, 24, lost, house, etc) is to sign up on  . it's legal (not a p2p environment) and much cheaper than the slingbox and don't forget the time difference) you can get graboid downloads (top movies too) for $5 a month or also 50Gbs of stuff for  sfr. 18.00 per month. a full movie is downloaded in 15mins.

			Hi Greystoke, if you haven't already taken your TV to Fust,you could try the TV Clinic which is at the bottom of Dolderstrasse, just before you  get to Hottingerplatz. He will come and look at your TV and give you a diagnosis (he did that for me and for my son). Save yourself some lugging and perhaps some expense! The name is Bertschi's Teleklinik.

			1) I am not sure any of the Swiss carriers offer a SIM-only plan. Pop into an Orange/Sunrise shop and ask.   
2) I also doubt that the SIM slot in your laptop would necessarily work for this purpose. There is a multitude of tech-standards (GPRS, EDGE, UMTS WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA, CDMA2000, EV-DO etc etc) out there, and every operator deploys its own unique mix.   
It MAY be technically possible, but probably not worth the time and effort for the occasional use you are describing.

			Most of the swiss providers require a 12 month contract on their plans, but if you go with orange, and bring your own phone, they'll only require a 3 month contract and give you 10 CHF discount on the price.

			Hi NoVaExpat, Thanks for your update.    
Quick q - I have Gamepass too and whilst the quality (the last 2 weeks) is decent, it's not amazing. Live games stream at about 800kbps on average, which given I have a 20MB/s connections seems a little slow. What bitrate do you get?   
Also, did you find a way to watch several games at once? They advertise the ability to watch up to 4 games at once. I assumed that to mean picture-in-picture or split screeen. Due to the fact I can't find such a function I am now beginning to think it means you can switch between any 4 games that are showing.    
Which isn't really watching them all ""at once"".   
BUt if you found out, please let me know!   
Thanks!

I have no hum with that.  It is kind of large but I have it hidden away behind the shelf.   
 I also bought a transformer for my powered subwoofer, but it was not as high quality as the other one, and that one causes my subwoofer to hum when it's on. Its not really noticeable when listening to music, but in quiet parts of movies I can hear it.   
I just havent felt like buying a new transformer or subwoofer so I have been living with the hum.

However, if the cable has an RJ11 style plug at the phone end, it's easy to unplug the cable and buy a new cable at MediaMarkt or similar.

			Hi,   
Just my small advice to also consider taking their glattvision package where you need to purchase a media box device and card for a one time fee which will allow you to view most English channels available with no monthly fees at all. Saves you the hassle of buying and setting up a satelite system to watch english TV channels.

			So, a report back to those condering a NFL Gamepass and that may not yet have purchased it...   
UNfortnuntely I ahve to report that Gamepass for both the first 2 weeks of the NFL season did not work properly. I think their servers are underpowered, as both weeks you could not watch the first game of the day. Picture qualtiy started of terrible before ceasing altogether. Everyone had the same problem (see other forums) but Neulion (the company responsible for NFL Gamepass) did refund subscribers the first 2 weeks, and promised to sort the probs.   
Just something to be aware of.   
It remains to be seen what happens tonight when Week 3 starts...

			I used the freezer trick to bring life back to my iPod.  After just over a year (naturally), it wouldn't boot up.  By freezing it, I got another six months out of it.  It works because the different metals contract at different speeds.   
Annoyingly, Apple were using Toshiba hard drives at the time, and they weren't available retail, so I couldn't repair the ipod myself.  That is why I don't buy Apple - too much proprietry hardware and software.

			There is another channel which may interest English speakers, namely the Arte channel. There are both German and French versions of this channel, but only the latter is of interest, as it sometimes shows films in the original language.  
Both channels have two audio tracks, so that one can select either French or German. However the Arte channel from France often puts the original language on the German audio track. As an example of what can be seen, a few days ago there was a film with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Baccall.    
Here are the tuning details:   
Arte (French):   
Astra (19 deg.), 11566 MHz/s, vertical polarization, 5/6, 22000 KS/s, provider=CANALSATELLITE   
Arte (German):   
Astra (19 deg.), 10743 MHz/s, horizontal polarization, 5/6, 22000 KS/s, provider=ARD   
The EPG on the French Arte channel is poor, showing only the current and the following program, whereas a full EPG is available on the German Arte channel. The two channels show the same program, but the times may differ slightly (French is sometimes 15 minutes earlier than German).

By being kept switched off the rest of the time you are reducing the risk of some incidental virus infection or damage through malfunction. Preferably you are physically keeping the disk in a separate place when not in use which further reduces the risk of it being lost in a fire or stolen etc.   
If for some reason that is not possibly or practicable, you would need a backup disk that conforms to much higher standards.

			Deploying a BES server for anything below 500 users and/or below top secret information is pointless. The charges and administration fees are high.    
What you could do is a ""hybrid"" solution on a budget. I am using Orange's BIS Blackberry service and use a private and a business email on it.    
The private mail is a gmail, nothing much to talk about.   
If you know your business pop3/imap/smtp information, this is a no brainer. If your company however is tough on allowing access from outside through the aforementioned, here is how I went around it.    
My business email is setup to forward copy of each received email to a second gmail. Now, inside gmail you have an option to ""send email as"" - dig through the settings. Basically, you enter the email that you wish to appear as sender, then gmail generates a confirmation email to this same account. Once you reply to this confirmation, in gmail you will be able to pick from which identity to reply.    
In short, on a single blackberry phone, with BIS you can have up to 10 email accounts set. I use only two - one personal and one business, without need for BES and with the ability to respond as   from the device.    
I hope this info is useful for you - do not hesitate to ask if my tips miss a piece you need.       "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Sep 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	blackberry Help	knthmm	Posts: 1

			Hi hawkiwa,   
I ordered espn360.com last night too and it works fine for me.    
Can you be more specific regarding the problems you're having? Where do the probs occur and what are the symptoms?   
I very much doubt that Cablecom is blocking the service.   
I did notice last night that espn360 dropped the signal a couple of times, but I kept trying and after a few mins everything was OK again. Picture quality on the BC/Kent State game was OK, comparable to VHS. The picture qualtiy on the ND/Michigan game was superb. It wasn't HD quality (you can't expect that ove the internet) but was equivalent to standard TV broadcasts (i.e. non-HD).

			If I may suggest Migros as another alternative to Swisscom.       
I use this kind of pre-paid phone and I love it.  You pay just for the phone and can then buy 15 to 30 CHF worth of talk time at a time.  It is cheap inside of Switzerland but expensive once you leave the boarders.  I usually go about 3 months on 30 CHF, and I call/SMS regularly.

			Just take the old card out of the unit and you will have all the free to air stuff, ie BBC1, BBC2 ITV1 etc.  
A friend / relative in the UK can call Sky and tell them that they have a box and want a card. You will be asked for serial number of the box, firmware number which you can access from pressing services and then system set up and system details, yes be prepared to have all these details handy.  
Another way is to take out a  new subscription with either a company  who will offer you such  a card,   or find someone in the UK who will help you. What set up do you have and what channels do you watch the most. Freesat   may be another solution if you don't want the sport and film options.

			if you support only 1 team, then you won't be watching the rest of them. So maybe only 4 EPL games per month. Champions League is on ITV HD, if not HD Suisse, and FA Cup is also sometimes on ITV HD.   
I watch golf too, and SKY.de has decent coverage. The only thing that is missing from the golf schedule is the Ladies PGA.

			Well folks... 
I have the dish correctly aligned! There was a local electronics store in my village of Sierentz who sent a guy around with the ladder and sat finder gear - and he took less than a hour (hindered by the few hundred wasps we have this time of year) to correctly align for FreeSat UK channels. 
My mythTV PC now happily records and shows the Free UK channels with no problems, and with much better quality than the digital tiv freeview I had back in the UK (no more signal breakups).   
So - we're all sorted now, chez nous, french tv via adsl2+ and UK (in time for ITV's champions league covereage) TV via sat !    
Anyway - big thanks to all you guys who offered advice etc! 
DANKE!

Ie I could 1) get a digital set-top-box to watch the free-to-air (digital) channels for 170CHF or 2) go for the Teleclub box for 40CHF a month plus package extras (sports etc) starting at 10CHF/month. I would definitely go for option 2. I see they charge a one-off connection charge of 95CHF though, but still its worth it.   
BTW - Teleclub via cable are offering a fantastic deal that ends tomorrow (31-Aug-09) free sports or the superpackage for 10CHF extra a month for 6 months! Pretty sweet me thinks.

I have a dreambox from Middle East where I was. Could this give me access to a lot more channels through my cable socket? Thanks for any advice...

Designed to work with the SKY Box only.  Uses teh Aerial Coaxial to transmit the IR signal to the SKY box.  The Eye box plugs into the TV inbetween the Coaxial and the SKY box.  This box removed the added voltage necessary for the Magic Eye.  Without this you would fry your TV aerial input (if you enable the Maigc Eye on the SKY box).   
Also the quality is not great, and not sure if this would work with a Swiss TV (encodes the signal for UK TV's) plus probably does not support HD Pictures.   
Need I say more?

			Just received our Sunrise bills for our various phones and my 14 year old daughter has 13 SMS at 5 Francs each.   
She's hazy on the details (!) but she says she wanted to do a quiz on facebook, and it asked her for her mobile number - which she foolishly did  . Then she started receiving SMS's offering money off various things.   
I just called Sunrise and they've blocked all premium SMS's for all our phones.    
The company is      
(That address appears to be shared ).   
I'll write to them and point out that as my daughter is not an adult, she can't legally sign a contract, therefore their charges are not legal, and include a payment slip for 65 Francs. No, I don't expect any response.   
I'll also write a complaint to Sunrise, asking why they partner with companies whose activities are barely legal.   
If there's anything else I should do (excluding dealing with my dear daughter), please let me know. ( I'm tempted with option 3 of my sig, so if you live nearby, you've been warned   ).

My Netopia router is on the second floor and barely down to the ground floor.  I installed the extender on the first floor and now have maximum signal throughout four floors of my house.   
It was a little tricky to set up, but now my wifi signal is now extended from the second floor all the way down to my basement where I get a full five bar maximum signal.

			If you already have the cell phone, then you can get a SIM card from any provider.    
Some service providers, e.g. Migros, sell a cheap bundle of phone and locked SIM card. The provider anticipates recovering the phone costs from the future call charges.

			or..   
get yourself a cantenna (a poor-man's-wifi-extender) and see if there are any unsecured networks in the area... or better yet a McDonalds or Starbucks.   
Cheapest solution is:    (FYI works better if you strip off the plastic from the USB WLAN adaptor)   
more complex:       
BUT, that is not entirely a legal...   
The best solution is buying a FON, though check if someone in your area has FON first.

I've used all 3 networks throughout the country. Generally speaking, they all work pretty good. And all will revert to EDGE if 3G is not present. Keep in mind Orange is mostly 1800Mhz GSM network, so their coverage in rural areas may not be as good as Swisscom or Sunrise who have alot more 900Mhz frequencies. Generally speaking, Swisscom has a much bigger network than Sunrise or Orange, so usually it works better/faster, but is a little more expensive as well.

			Just found out that Helvatel is charging 10Rp per connection for calls to UK on top of normal tariff. There is no connection charges in Teleswiss and Raptel.    
Raptel 3Rp/min with 0 connection charges 
Teleswiss as above 
Helvatel 2Rp/min with 10Rp connection charges.   
It means that calls less than 10 minutes duration are better off with Raptel or Teleswiss. But calls longer than 10 minutes are good with Helvatel.

			Sky germany provides all the channels you want for Fr.47.90 + Fr.9.90 per month (movie + star packet), and you don't have to spend money on an agent.   
Problem is, I do not know if they are all in English. A few weeks ago, they opened up all the channels just for a weekend and I watched Nat geographic in English, but Discovery was only in German. All the movie channels are also shown in original language, though. The Swiss company that handles Sky Germany is actually Teleclub.        
Probably worthwhile to call them and ask.

			You can use a slingbox, however as far as I remember the Bluewun remote control wasn't included in the Slingbox software. 
They have just released a new version of Slingbox software and too be honest I havent checked whether the new version includes Bluewin. 
 The other way is to stream the UK channels live via catchuptv.com, BBC ipl*yer, Sky pla*er or the UK version of Zattoo. PM me for details, if you feel this is an option.

			Hello All,   
I just got an Iphone from Orange. Pay 99 CHF 1 giga and unlimited calls to landline phones and other cell phones. I think the swisscom offer is that you have unlimited calls but only for other swisscome mobiles and landline numbers. Might be worth checking it out. Also I got a better price because of this plan (~149CHF for the phone for a one year plan ).   
Good luck!

			Sunrise Natel Data Easy might be an option?  99 francs for the dongle + SIM with 40 francs credit on it.  There's some maximum charge.   
Oh and the dongle appears not to be simlocked and appears to have the firmware allowing 7.2Mbs.   
I'm sure Orange and Sunrise do similar options - and they have daily maximums you will pay (certainly Swisscom does).

			Hello,  I am not great at French so this may be docced already but I just can't tell.  Question is whether it is possible to use BlueWin TV as a feed into a MediaCenter PC ? (Windows 7 currently but it doesn't matter which one).  Obviously its just an Ethernet connection but I was wondering firstly whether it would be understood as surely the decoding is done on the appliance you are given by swisscom and secondly if you can get it to decode will the Ethernet cable function as a standard IP Port as well or would you need dual cards in your piece of kit ?  I think its a lovely service as it is but would be the finishing touch if I could run it via the frontroom PC.   
thanks   
Mike

Most TV companies don't want to broadcast DVB-T because the real numbers of actual viewers is soooo small - something like less than 10% of Swiss viewers watch TV over DVB-T   
So most TV companies prefer to use one or more of the 300-ish cable TV operators in this country to reach their market.   
SRG has a federal obligation to provide TV coverage to xx% of Swiss viewers, hence they are on DVB-T. 
They probably would rather not be as cost per viewer is horrendously high.

			Speaking of language, I'm mildly annoyed by the fact that if you call from a landline you'll get directly to German (or whichever is the language of the area where you call from), and if you want another language you have to ask to the operator.   
If you want to be able to choose the language you have to call from a mobile phone    
Regarding the double bill of last month, I called them (with the mobile phone to have Italian  ) as soon as I saw this strange bill, and they had no clue. Only now they figured out the mistake and explained it on their website.

FWIW I have 100/90 on both tuners on my Sky+.  But that's the default transponder; the key is the signal for the 2D channels like BBC1; I also get 80% quality on those too, on a 1m dish with .3 Quad LNB   "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: May 2006	Groaned at 3 Times in 3 Posts	Watching BBC [with Cablecom Digital Price drop news]	muze7	Posts: 1,205

There is normally no human involvement at all.   
You can always ask for clariifcation - and they will look into their computer systems and see that the computer logged the call was being made.   
Voice records are normally not kept!   
You best thing to do is go and see the help desk people in person at the nearest service center or help point or whatever they call it. Take the invoice. Tell them what happened. Talk to them in a friendly manner.   
The majority of the time there is a logical reason for what happened, scams are few and far between.

			I bought a wall plate with SAT, Radio and TV outputs from satshop but the problem is I don't know how to connect to it. I have a sat cable feed that comes from a multi-switch but looking at the wall plate it requires two ""wires"" as input. A bit similar as to a speaker but slightly thicker.   
I've tried searching for something that can convert/split the sat cable to two wires but you can only imagine what I find with any those two words combined with sat.   
Does anyone know?

1: HD is not available in all areas 
2: Double recording 2 channels is not available in all areas 
3: One you have the equipment, no more cost other than a subscription. 
4: Can run up to 8 receivers from one dish. 
5: Multisatellite can give you most of the Bluewin channels. 
6: Choice of receiver - Bluewin is what it is, no deviation 
7: Films in English   
I should add I watch English, French and German TV and have both SKY and Bluewin TV,  from the beginning mainly for French TV, I live in the German region. I can now do more with my satellite equipment that my Bluewin box and I am cancelling my Bluewin subscription.    
On the plus side for Blue Win, it is great for people who want the main English channels and cannot point a dish southwards. I know that you can have a second Blue Win Box, but this is extra cost,  but when the children want to watch a channel and the adults another then it is difficult.   
I also encourage everyone to watch the local channels also to 'learn the language' if necessary and to take the best TV from everything available either from satellite or Bluewin TV.

First step is jailbreak and unlock (via ultrasn0w) for 3.0 software on iPhone 3G. Next the same thing for 3GS. Jailbreak and unlock for 2.0 software (iPhone 3G) has been around for a while

You also get 60 free minutes per month as a Swisscom DSL subscriber.   
Nevertheless - I can really see Swisscom introducing at-home hotspots in the near future. I sure hope participation will be volunatry. They'll probably give customers a rebate on their DSL bill if they participate.

			Actually, if you don't want to force your phone in manual mode, I just saw you can also request Sunrise to block roaming on your account via the on-line account manager:       
...but I guess it takes 24 hours or so for it to take effect. I would prefer the manual option, if supported by the phone, that way if you find yourself in Germany/France etc. you can switch it immediately to make a call.

			From my understanding, the issue is related to powering the LNB.   
If you go to the link I provided it gives details.  Something along the lines of 'Often output 1 of the LNB is used as the only source of power, therefore if the second output is the only active one, then the LNB might not have power to operate'.

			Hi   
Is there anyone in Aargau who uses Sunrise for their fixed line phone/ADSL? I've searched posts all over the Forum about Sunrise but they all seem to concern mobile services.    
The thing is their offers seem really good in terms of combined cost, internet speed, unlimited calls, cheap calls to Europe etc especially if your line is in an area that is ""dégroupé"" (not sure what that is in English or German - sorry - but esentially it means you don't need a Swisscom line so you don't pay them for line rental in addition to your Sunrise contract).    
Anyway, I wondered if anyone knows about the actual service they provide. Evidently, it doesn't matter how attractive the offers are if you can never get a connection or if the help desk/after-sales service is useless.   
Does anyone have any experience of Sunrise in this respect please?   
Thanks for any feedback

If you look at Zattoo's channel list then ITV1 is the only possible candidate - but I cant confirm it.

			If it's any help, I have Cablecom Broadband at home and Orange 3G Broadband for my netbook. The Cablecom works great, and really does deliver the bandwidth they promised (I've got the 25Mbit/s service, and I've had downloads running at 2.5-3MBytes/s, where the server at the other end can go that fast!). I've had it since December, and no probs so far!   
As for Orange, I've had that since September and its so-so. There's no major problems, but the network's not that fast (comapred to the Vodafone 3G service I had in the UK), and it does occasionally fail to connect...

			Just out of curiosity, has anyone else noticed that the speech isn't correctly synchronized with the lips on the BBC and ITV channels on Bluwin? I can't work out if it is just an occasional problem or if it is all the time and I notice it only part of the time (at some times it seems worse than at others). I haven't noticed it on the German channels (but I may be focusing too much on the language to notice any other oddities).   
Also, is the screen size format different in CH than in the UK? I can't seem to get the picture to fill the whole screen and I have tried all the options under the bit in the menu where you can choose your screen size. At one point, I got it to work so that I controlled the bluwin TV through my old TV remote control rather than via bluwin and changed the settings on the TV itself (if that makes sense), which made the picture bigger, but still about 5 cm short all round. The picture is slightly smaller when I watch BBC/ITV and slightly larger when I watch the German stations (when it fills the whole screen vertically, but not horizontally). It isn't a big problem, I am just wondering if anyone else had noticed this.    
kfc.   
Have you contacted Bluewin support about this?   
No, I wanted to know first if this was normal. WHen the bluwin TV guy set up my TV, he phoned up about the screen size, but then just left it as it was, so I get the feeling there will be nothing they can do about that. The discussion he had over the phone was in Swiss German, so I didn't understand it, and he had spent 3 hours setting it up, and I was needing to get back to work, so didn't grill him on it at the time.   
Also, I suspect I use my router differently from most people in that I turn it off whenever I am not using it. It is a bit warm to touch and I don't like it being on when I am not in the room. I would probably try keeping it on all the time before phoning bluwin, if I found that my problem with the syncrhonization was unusual. It is possible that after it warms up, the synchronization is OK, since I get too involved in the programme after a while to notice. Just wondered if anyone else had this. Same with the screen size, really, no point in phoning up if it is relatively well-known that screen sizes are different across UK and Switzerland/Germany.   
kfc.   
Synchronisation is perfect for me, also when using the computer. Are you in an area with the latest equipment at the exchange (i.e. can you record 2 shows at the same time?)   
I have a 16:9 screen and 16:9 shows fill it correctly. Programs transmitted in 4:3 are correctly sized i.e. they don't fill the whole screen.   
I have Bluewin. I also noticed the lip-sync but it does disappear sometimes. I also have the little screen with big black spaces but luckily my TV has a screen format button & I push it a couple of times till the picture fits. magic. no problem it works. My TV is a 7 yr old Philips, no HD and not even a flat screen but it works.      I've had a plethora of problems with Bluewin TV and recently switched to Satellite reception (via a Technisat Multytenne, giving me access to all the British FTA channels as well). But I never had sync problems. Did you try to turn off the box and reboot it?  That usually got rid of my choppy picture, choppy sound, no sound, ""HD recorder not available"", being unable to delete prerecorded programs, deleting corrupted programs, fixing HD-video output issues etc.   
dawiz   
I've found it works better since I started keeping the router switched on - the synchronization appears to be fine now.   
I probably still need to faff about with my TV for the screen size. The vertical black bits on the left and right are far blacker than when the black horizontal edging shows (and is sometimes filled, so I think that bit is probably variable according to the transmission, so it is just the very black bits on the left and right that I need to sort out). Haven't had time yet to do it, though! I have a Lexsor LCD 27"" TV in case anyone has a quick tip (not really expecting it, but just thought I would throw it out there).   
kfc.   
I have a new HD Ready TV, but my telephone signal is not strong enough to receive HD programmes on my Bluewin TV. I have spoken to Swisscom, and it seems that supplying a stronger telephone signal is not foreseen for the area(s) in which I live. Does anyone else find themselves in this situation?      Yes.... checked it online before ordering... so I did not order.   
I was one of the first to get Bluewin TV (over 2 years ago) despite the fact that my phone line only supported ADSL as VDSL was still in the works (or so they said). Well it's been over 2 years and I'm still waiting for VDSL so I've waited long enough, I'm canceling my Bluewin TV finally. I started with digital TV over my TV cable line (Wasserwerke Zug WWZ) and it blows away anything Bluewin has to offer even if I had VDSL. Best part is that not only can I watch a program while recording another at the same time (which my ADSL line can't support) my digital TV line can record   different channels while I'm viewing a 3rd channel at the same time..!! Lots of HD channels as well..!       Many thanks for your interesting reply vwild!  I must admit my multi-cultural family and I really do enjoy what Bluewin TV offers, so I would be reluctant to change because of the lack of HD - at least for the moment.  I shall just continue to complain to Swisscom! However, I do think Swisscom should be more open to potential Bluewin clients, (a point I have made very clear to them), in informing the latter that the acquisition of Bluewin TV does not automatically give access to HD transmissions!      If you can receive VDSL (and it's easy to find out via the Bluewin Website in English) then the Bluewin TV Plus service can do everything described above (HD channels plus the multiple simultaneous recordings) and for me it gives me more British channels than the local Cablecom can offer at a competitive price.  I installed the system myself and found the English-language instructions spot-on.       
Am I to understand from your post that you are able to receive HD transmissions on your Bluewin TV swiss bill?  Swisscom has told me that my telephone line transmits 12,000 bits? (whatever that may mean!), but 20,000 is needed to receive the HD transmissions. I also opted for the Plus service, and am really happy with Bluewin TV apart from the HD problem.   
Ive had the same problem with HD transmissions, and our phone line transmits at 20,000. I think there is a conflict , when non hd programes transmit. sometimes ours works, sometimes not.  But i find there is virtually no difference between HD and non hd programmes. 
Other than that ive had no problems with Bluewin           
Many thanks Karl - interesting to note that even with the required 20,000 bits, you still experience problems sometimes!      Yes, I can confirm that I can receive HD (BBC HD, Swiss HD and possibly ARTE via BTV, but I haven't got round to checking HD channels other than the first two).  I don't know about the number of bits you need, but as far as I remember I checked first on availability by using their website, and entering postal code/ village and that came back with what I could receive at my home.   
I am having problems with my Bluewin TV reception.  The picture ""freezes"" and blocks, but the sound continues.  This happens on all channels.  Is anyone else experiencing this problem?   
If you have Bluewin TV boax have tried to switch off the Box totally from the mains power for around 5 mins and restarted it again?   
I was asked to do this by Swisscom Bluewin helpdesk person and it worked for me.

			Hello all,   
Just to update you all in case someone have similar problem in the future.   
Thanks for all the helpful tips. Today at I called and to my surprise, the operator is quite helpful. The first one said he will try to speak English and then half way through he redirect me to a technician. The technician cannot speak English but she said she will find an English speaker to talk to me. It just takes less than 2 mins that another English speaking technician answered my call and then we went through all the checking process and finally they decided that it is the box that had the problem. They will send me a new one and I need to post the old one the them. They said it will takes normally 1 week for up to 2 weeks. All in all I am quite lucky as I finished my whole inquiry thing within 20 mins with the help of 3 helpful operator.    
I hope they do delivery what they had promised. I hope other people are as ""lucky"" as me ... oh.. I should say I hope no one have to use the customer service to begin with indeed!

			Yes, basically if you input a Video and audio signal to the TV, it will work.   
i.e. Via:   
HDMI (Digital Video and Audio) - Best quality 
Component Video + Audio 
SCART (European standard connector, basically a Analogue HDMI) 
S-Video + Audio 
Composite Video + Audio - Worst quality           
European TV's tend to support all SD (Standard Definition) Video formats, including NTSC.   
HD Ready - 720p 
Full HD - 1080p   
702/1080 number of lines. 
P- Progressive scan , updates EVERY line each scan 
I - interlaced, updates every otehr line each scan (i.e. scan 1odd number lines, scan 2 even, scan 3 odd.....)   
Many devices can convert 1080i to 1080p   
HDMI latest standard - 1.3x   
Did I miss something?  Audio formats I guess, but that's another story in itself. Google is your friend         "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: May 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Does a Swiss LCD (HDMI) TV work in the UK?	hannah smith	Posts: 11

			paddyG,   
Asus does make one for intel 775, the P5N7A-VM. 
Also, I recommend having a look here at Anandtech.com       
They have their recommendations on what parts to use for HTPCs based on AMD and Intel systems. Thats what helped push me to select the board I used. Anandtech recommends a Gigabyte board for their Intel system. The article is a month or two old, but I think its still pretty useful.     
For oognip, Blu ray is Sony's new standard for High defintion video. 
While a regular dvd plays video at 720 x 480 pixels, the Blu ray has 1920 x 1080 pixels. Also the Blu ray has a maximum capacity of 50GB compared to 8.5 for a standard DVD.   
As several people mentioned above, the Sony playstation 3 uses a blu ray drive.

			Well there is no such thing as an Astra LNB (that I know of).   
Most LNB's you buy today are: Universal Digital LNB's   
But as mentioned there are specialised one's as well.   
The SKY Oval Dishes need a 'special LNB' where the focal horn is designed for an oval dish.  SO the LNB from a SKY oval dish will not work so well on a normal round dish.

			If all else fails, I recently got one of   and am very pleased with it.  
Plugged it in (it does English no probs), let it do it's thing and I now have all BBC broadcastings (including CBeebies, Wooh!!) and ""Five"".    
I don't know, but maybe if nothing else turns up, could be worth a look. It's only small, not so expensive and I have found, offers rather good quality reception ( get the occasional picture break up, that lasts for a split second or two).   
In fact, it has a double bonus for me, our original t.v remote control went to t.v remote control heaven some time ago and the (cheapo) universal remote control I got, works, as such, but all the fine tuning options were lost.    
Now after getting this little dandy all set up, I have a new remote control that syncs with the universal remote I have and has somehow, automatically adjusted the picture quality and format (very much improved!) on our t.v.   
Anyway, just a thought, sorry I can't help you with your original problem.

			The LNB is the same, the difference is direction you point the satelite. Freeview comes from Astra2, the Swiss channels use Hotbird. If you have a disk big enough you could pick both up with the same dish, just two LNBs pointing in different directions. 
Personally we had two dishes, one picked up BBC, ITV etc, the other the Swiss channels. You need a card for the Swiss Channels too, although it costs next to nothing I recall, say 100CHF a year if that, I think it lasts for several years.   
Used a French decoder by a company called aston   which worked a treat for the Swiss Channels, used the same to pickup free-to-air BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, ITV2 etc. Dont know if a freeview card would work with this box...

Any such thing is possible. I wanted to have all Hindi channels and Sky sports. Is it possible here in  , and if yes what's the approximate total cost involved.

			=Samsung i7500 Android phone coming to Switzerland, Denmark= 			 				 					 						 				    Following Germany were hearing two more European markets will be getting Samsungs first Android-powered handset. Its Switzerland and Denmark, which will get the i7500 in July and September, respectively. 
 Apparently, Swiss will be able to grab the device somewhere in July for 699 Swiss francs which is about $615. Thats the unsubsidized price without and contracts and rebates. 
 As for Denmark, it looks the Samsung i7500 is heading to Copenhagen and other places in the country in September, with the price of $440. That doesnt sound much and I wonder why is price so different between the two countries. Guess well have more details in the coming weeks. Stay tuned in the meantime

4638	21.09.2007, 16:20	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: Winterthur	"    My understanding of this was a little different. BBC were all paying Sky to be on their satellite  bandwidth and program guide. As part of this agreement their channels were encrypted and you needed a sky viewing card to decrypt them. But at time went on, the BBC didn't see the value in paying sky for this service, so switched to another satellite in the Astra cluster. Sky realised they still needed the BBC, as they produce the majority of the UKs high quality television, so didn't remove them from the EPG. But as the signals was no longer encrypted there was no way to ensure that only the license payers in the UK got the BBC. Sky can broadcast over a large area with strong signals as they ""know"" all their views are in the UK. Sky installed the box, it's plugged into a UK phone line you have a valid viewing card registered at/send to a UK address. With their open signals the BBC can't ensure this, so have tried to focus the signal purely on the UK which is why you have a weaker signal for the free to air (FTA) channels as opposed to the others, including the free to view (FTV), which can be watched without subscription, but require a viewing card.    
Or at least that is what I think happened...

			In my post of April 05 I assumed that the Swisscom max 8.07 Rp would be on top of what the provider charges. It seems that the total maximum charge on 0840 numbers is 8.07 Rp. Having used Tieftarife for a while and checking my online Swisscom bills I see that when Tieftarife charges 1 Rp a call indeed costs around that. ""Around"" because the billing seems to be in 10 Rp bits, so it's never precise. 
However with UK at 2 Rp and USA at 1 Rp they are much cheaper than 10787 and also easier to use as you just pay through your Swisscom bill. 
Quality of the line has been excellent each time so far.

			hi,   
I agree pretty much with your sentiments, though really Apple is a hardware and marketing than a technology company which is what you expect when it is led by a salesman. You could have added the iTunes lock in, installation of software such as MobileMe clients and Safari on PCs without the agreement of the PC users when all they were doing was trying to keep up with the patches for iTunes and Quicktime. Also using bundling ( iLife) which reduces competition and using a monopoly position in one market --- mp3 players to gain unfair advantage in another market ( smartphones). Tieing the browser to the operating systems and not allowing competitors the ability to offer alternatives....on the iPhone.   
Apple are just as bad if not worse than most of their competitors. Despite what some people may think Apple is never been the ""cuddly"" consumer focused company that people sometimes paint it as.   
As someone said to me as soon as companies have shareholders who want a return on their investment...they all become ""evil"".   
Have fun   
Martin

			Took about 5 days for the modem to arrive ( I ordered online in English ).   was a snap, and later, I ordered a 3rd party service for a virtual landline ( CHF9/- a month ) and eventually upgraded that basic analogue package you mentioned, to Digital for CHF6/- monthly.   
You'll find answers to most questions somewhere in this forum - these search   might help you.   
Good luck.

Any capacity involved is from the donor base station where the repeater is getting the signal from. If anything, repeaters actually help improve capacity in UMTS networks by reducing interference.   
The problem with trains is the speed they move at make handovers between cells a problem. Plus the increased fading margins that also come at high speeds.

now calls to Switz landlines and UK landlines is free, so you can call to UK landlines(and a lott of other places like US landline+mobile, Germany ll, Australia ll etc. ) for free if you give source number as Switzerland landline. But you need to pay a Euro 10 credit which lasts 3 months , and free calls are limited to 300 minutes per week (per IP address)    
Voice quality is tops.    
p.s : if you sign up with a Non-EU mobile number , you dont have to pay the VAT rates.

			Clever!   
But what the video doesn't say is that you need to rotate the can/phone until the open (front of phone) is pointing at the nearest cellphone base station. If you don't know where that is, try rotating SLOWLY whilst watching the signal level icon on the phone. Make sure as few objects, (metal, walls, people) are in the line of the phone to that distant cellphone base station as these soak up the signal.   
SMS's will often get through when signal levels are much too low for a conversation.   
You can attach a headset once you've got the orientation right. If your headset has a call answer button you won't need to pick it up. Better still if it has voice-activated dialling.   
But a proper directional external antenna will give even better results.

			NHL in Europe is streamed LIVE (and archived for later viewing) through ESPN America (ESPN 360 in Europe).       
The fees:    
NHL Playoff pass - 54 CHF (this includes rest of season, ALL playoff games, and the cup final).   
NHL Early bird pass - 144 CHF (INCLUDES the playoffs, needs to be purchased before season starts).    
NHL Monthly Recurring pass - 24 CHF   
NHL Day pass - 14 CHF   
They have low quality streams and high quality streams you can choose (depending on your connection). All games are EST.    
Works on MAC and PC. Games are FULLSCREEN. Quality is great.

Web-Browsing will still eat up your included volume very quickly and roaming will be very expensive. The 3mb that's included in the roaming option is enough for about 1500 e-mails (without attachments - which aren't automatically downloaded with the blackberry service) according to Swisscom.   
They have the ""Euro passport"" option that can be added (for free) to all subscriptions. That lowers the tariffs for calls within most European countries to 1.10 CHF for the first minute and 60 Rp for all subsequent minutes. Incoming calls are 40 Rp per minute.  
That's still insanely expensive but it's about the same as with any other European carrier.       
If you plan on calling European or US landlines from your mobile (from within Switzerland) a lot, Orange will be cheaper for you - they charge calls to EU countries as domestic calls. You can even use up your included minutes for calls to these countries.    
Anyway, despite these options voice and data abroad is still so expensive that I hardly ever use my phone when I'm outside of Switzerland.

			Well I found (typically daft) workaround to get the HTC HD to play live streaming BBC World Service radio.   
This workaround uses the Windows Internet Explorer(IE) + Media Player rather than Opera + Streaming Player combo I was expecting.    
Oh well here goes....   
Bookmark :     
In Windows Internet Explorer (or Opera) click on the GotRadio link and this will open up a stream of American RnB / droning teen rock BUT it does work and open up a functioning 'live' stream In Windows Media Player. 
This takes about 30 seconds to get audio.   
Next open up your bookmarked link to BBC World Service in IE :       
this will show an error page saying you don't have the correct plug ins. So click on the Launch in Stand Alone Player and it will launch in Windows Media Player.   
Make sure you connect using WIFI or you'll get a massive data bill. Also when you play without earphones the speaker is on the back of the unit so place the phone face down for extra volume.   
If you have problems with the BBC site you may need to go to the BBC site go to preferences and make Desktop Connection and Windows Media Player as your IE browser's default settings.   
I'm sure there's an easier method (go and replace your HTC phone with a Nokia that does radio streaming of BBC radio effortlessly) but I just figured this out and thought I'd pass it on.     
Just found a website with  rtsp:// live (partial delay) radio station links that seem to work with Real One Player (not the basic Streaming Player):   
Radio4: 
rtsp://rmlive.bbc.co.uk/bbc-rbs/rmlive/ev7/live24/radio4/live/r4_dsat_g2.ra 
Others:     
I'd be interested to hear if anyone else has found ways to play genuine live radio stations on the HD including how it was acheived using which apps and browser.   
Anyone know where I can get a better list of radio stations using a rtsp:// format URL ? This is the only format accepted by Real One Player (and the not so reliable Streaming Media for Pocket PC).

			Thanks for the info  - that's just what I needed to know.  It's an interesting setup though - if all the apartments are wired together like that and you order/pay for cable separately...how do they control what type of cable package you get?     
In the US each apartment would be individually wired to essentially a control box and they put on the filters from there depending on your cable package.     
But here, if all the apartments here are daisy chained together, wouldn't that suggest that even if I pay for basic cable that if someone else in my building pays for more channels...then everyone would get those same channels as well?

4698	04.02.2009, 00:55	Senior Member	Thanked 98 Times in 77 Posts	Location: Nyon	"    This is not good news for me as renting the HD box was my plan forward. At least though if it starts playing up Cablecom will be responsible for it and not me as I will only be renting. Currently I am stuck with a box I own, out of warranty and no-one to fix it.   
I did actually find a local electrical store who said that if it is a hardware problem they could probably fix it, but not if the problem was with the software. I am tending to think it is a software issue as I am getting things like the ""parental control"" screen coming on out of nowhere and of course the ubiquitous ""software upgrade in progress"" screen.   
I do find that the problem is worse when we first turn the box on and gets a little better the longer it is going. And that it seems worse at night than during the day. Anyone else notice the same?

			some how the tele marketing added some SMS options, and I did not notice it for last 8 months.   
Just noticed it today and called up the customer service; they apologized and told me that either I could contest the billing for last 8 months ; or they will credit me SFR 40 in next month's bill.   
I liked that ""customer oriented"" approach   
p.s. I asked them to credit 40 SFR

			So, I called orange last night and after being on hold for 30 min, I was informed that their system experiences some issues since Feb 18. The card itself is sort of activated, but the accounts system does not function and doesn't activate the account; even if you want to refill you are not able to.    
It ****ed me off because no-one in their kiosk told me about it (neither the person from whom I bought the card nor the second person I spoke in another orange store yesterday) and the lade on the phone explained me that probably they don't know! Well, how should I know - I wouldn't bought it if I knew or at least if they have told me! I will probably return it now although she mentioned that the others also have problems. Those are like 10 days - is it that difficult to solve the issue or inform their staff? I don't want to behave like complaining North American, but those are some basic customer relationships! (plus, they were speaking in English because I asked them nicely in German if they can speak either in English or in French - so I don't think they had language issues) whatever - my first encounter with problems here and customer service

4711	15.02.2009, 17:49	Senior Member	Thanked 81 Times in 43 Posts	Location: UK (ex CH)	"    Yes but:   I've just looked up the prices for iWork and iLife in the UK (£69 for the single user version, £85 for the Family License Pack vs CHF 109/139 here). At the current mid-rate of 1 GBP = 1.69287 CHF (from  ) it is cheaper to buy here at the moment (69.00 GBP = 116.808 CHF).   
Those are VAT inclusive prices of course, and the UK VAT element for the £69 single user version comes to £9.00 (versus Swiss VAT of CHF 7.70 on the price of CHF 109 here). If you are going to claim UK VAT back and then pay the Swiss VAT here, it's cheaper to buy in the UK.   
It doesn't make much difference at this price level, but if you are thinking about buying the high end products and are planning a visit to another country anyway, there are potential savings to be made.

			Hi,   
I hope this isn't a duplicate thread, sorry if it is.   
We've got BBC One and can't wait for the new Formula One season to start.  They are showing the practice sessions on the red interactive channels, which we don't receive.     
From digging around it seems that the DSF channel showed the practice sessions last season - does anyone know if they will be doing the same this year?  Or any other channels?   
Thanks 
Matthew

			I do not think this is a local rip off thing but a general notice to make sure you don't get ripped off by unscrupulous tradesmen.   
I recently had a satellite dish tuned in by an english ""specialist"" in the unterageri area. He displayed the usual competence of an english tradesman, drank coffee, boasted about making pots of cash from foreigners, charged a lot in cash and left - the dish stopped working due to incompetent work and he refused to come back.  Swiss guy was cheaper, friendlier, quicker and competent. It still works despite snow, thaw etc...   
So caveat emptor, my friends.

			I recorded it and finally watched this excellent film based on a true story.   
However it was totally ruined for me by two really stupid 'continuity' problems. As the real patient went to Zurich in January, the film story line showed the family going out to Zurich then too, soon after Christmas. But what did they find here? Switzerland in mid-summer! Trees with leaves and despite the family wearing thick coats the background public could clearly be seen in shirt sleeves through the taxi window.   
And that taxi. How come they had the same taxi to and from the airport and every time they took a trip?    
I have actually written in the past to the BBC about their series 'Casualty' when inside the hospital they had Christmas decorations up, but outside it was summer and a new doctor drove to work through leafy streets in a convertible with the roof down. I asked what was the point of taking such pride in getting the medical aspects correct, if they made such fundamental bloomers. 'A Short Trip to Switzerland' suffered the same indignity...

			It would presumably have been simple if they could only send out the right modem with the right username/password.    
I had a total of 3 modems sent out to me. Every time I tried to hook it up, it wouldn't work. I called support and they say for each time ""sorry, we've sent you the wrong modem and the username/password won't work with it. Can you please send that modem back to us?""    
Apparently, whoever took my details had entered in some wrong bit of info. However, they could seem to correct it as each time I call, the wrong info remained even after the previous call where they assured me the details had been corrected and they would then be able to send me a modem that works.    
Well, after the third time, I got sick of it and went to Swisscom. Hooked up with in a couple days and their tech support were superb and spoke excellent English to boot.    
Later, I got a bill from Cablecom charging me for mailing the modem which never worked. I paid it because I just couldn't bear to deal with Cablecom anymore.    
The long and short is the Cablecom may seem cheap but you pay for it when it comes to customer care and technical support.      "	slipped a little	Join Date: Aug 2008	Groaned at 7 Times in 1 Post	Cablecom on Bluewin -- general differences!	Neddles	Posts: 49

			Hi All,   
I just picked up my new Touch HD a few weeks ago, and I have to say it's the best phone I've ever had, by far (my previous two phones were an HTC TyTN II and a Samsung Blackjack, so I'm used to WM).  I acknowledge the frustration that the original poster has, but I think a lot of the negatives are a result of the reviewer moving to a new OS, and admittedly, WM6 is not the greatest mobile OS.  That being said, I think HTC has done a great job with this phone;s interface.  And on this beautiful (and HUGE!) screen, it looks fantastic.  I've played around with a few friends' iPhones, and I find that my Touch HD is just a better phone (and is much more flexible).  Here's what the HD (or most WM phones) can do that the iPhone can't:   
1. Multitask (you can run several programs at the same time) - iPhone is a single task OS, I Believe 
2. Add additional storage (the phone ships with an 8G microSD card, which you can upgrade to 32GB 
3. Turn by Turn navigation (I have TomTom installed, and it works really really well 
4. Removable battery (great if you are a heavy user and like to carry around a spare battery) 
5. FM Radio tuner built in   
And in terms of hardware specs, the Touch HD is better in just about every department (higher resolution screen, bigger screen, better camera, etc)   
Also, regarding some of the original complaints, there is a great site that has all sorts of software (including entirely custom ROM's) for the Touch HD:       
I installed one of the custom ROMs that lets me play youtube videos within my Opera Browser.   
Just wanted to chime in, as I felt the original review was extremely negative (and as someone else pointed out, this phone has mostly rave reviews from the tech press).   
Oh, btw... I bought my phone from Expansys.uk (shipped by Expansys.ch) for about 700CHF, unlocked.  Expensive, I know, but much better than the 800+ CHF I see on Digitec, and other sites.   
Cheers, 
Tony

			My experience is pretty good!   
There's a lot in the internet about the android phone, so I can't really add much. And I haven't found any Switzerland-specific issues.   
Of course you should get a generous data connection contract with your provider in order to fully leverage the phone capabilities, but any of the main providers (Swisscom, Sunrise, Orange) are good for that.

I almost never use a mobile privately, and I'll soon be getting a dedicated work mobile. So I have absolutely nothing to gain (an a fair amount of cash to lose) by shelling out for a phone contract of any kind where a cheap prepaid does the job nicely.    
But there are some features of a phoneless iPhone that would be handy. But still, there are some features that appear to be possible in an iPod Touch only when cracked (VoIP and naviation, for example). Maybe I should just get nothing for now and wait a bit longer.

			For Stands Media Markt used to have a tripod style one (welded joints).   
I don't like the square base ones with the pole in the corner as these are a bit flimsy.   
One excellent solution I came up with is an acroprop.  These are the builders poles used to prop up buildings during renovation/construction.  If you have a concrete balcony with the same above works a treat and with minimal footprint.  You can get these from Baubedarf or any big Builders merchants.   
You can get brown dishes but not sure if you want this on the Balcony.

			Its not the cable, I ran a brand new 20 mtr length down from the attic to my sky box.  My worry was over the total lack of signal, I assumed the disk was at least pointing at a satellite...   
However, I think I now need to call in a man with a meter and a ladder - the dish is up on the roof, I'd be fairly certain that the likely outcome of me going on the roof to adjust it would be   
a) No satellite signal 
b) A broken leg    
I think I'll also invest in a couple of new LNB's - not too expensive and I think from everything I've read that they are actually goosed, or I'd be seeing some sort of signal.   
Thanks to all for the help.....I need to get myself organised in advance of Saturday's Heineken Cup matches !!

4760	null	null	null	null	"    I read about shots from digital cameras being used at A3 size but then I am puzzled about the resolution when printed. The maximum picture size is 4000x3000 pixels which equates to 10x13.3 inches at 300dpi print resolution if the camera could really resolve at that level but system resolution with lens resolution and sensor resolution combined would limit it to about 8x10 inches at 300 dpi print resolution. If your 8 inches becomes nearly the 12 inches for A3 size then your print resolution is down to 200 dpi. Is this enough for catalogue work?

Does anyone know if and when Channel Five (UK) might be coming to Cablecom?  I know it went on Freesat at the end of last year so I was hoping Cableom would follow, but I've searched and can find no clues.   
I know it's got a bad reputation as a channel but I have my reasons.

			For TV coverage, Setanta UK, but you will need a Sky box first. Three games a week of AFL live plus all the finals. They also do NRL   
Eurosport 2 covers a game of AFL every week. If you get it through Sky you get English commentary but if you get it through Cablecom you get German commentary.

			Thanks for your reply even if i didnt exactly understood what you mean. Basically the plug is like you described. So i should connect the antenna cable from the plug to the tv and if it doesnt fit i should get a female-to-male converter if this is how they are called right?   
i am sure i have cable because i checked with naxoo and the regie and both said that as soon as the Tv is connected it should work

Now just need to work out how to get the other channels, I will leave it a little while to see if it realises we have a subscription. Sky are still taking payments and have not sent any correspondence to us to say it's been cancelled.

4768	07.01.2009, 20:22	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 4 Times in 1 Post	Location: Zurich	"    This is nothing new - about 2 years ago I wanted to downgrade (I wanted the CHF45 package instead of CHF60 ) and of course there was a fee. So I actually did sign up with Swisscom (they were promoting Bluwin TV then) and as soon as Cablecom received my cancellation letter (which was sent by Swisscom), I got a phone call from Cablecom offering me a couple of goodies.    
At first we thought it was too late as I was already bound to the Swisscom contract, but then Swisscom figured out that my building could not be connected. So I managed to get out of the Swisscom contract and stay with Cablecom, with free downgrade and a few months rental at half price as well (as if I was a new client). They did make me stay for a minimum 12 months again though, which was fine as I could not get Swisscom anyway (of course, cablecom does not know this).

They also offer a 75mb data package for 10 Fr. or a 1gb package for 19 fr / month which is pretty cheap. If you 're ever planning on using data I'd steer away from prepaid offerings.

			Today all camcorders take stills.  A few of the new high-end dSLRs can take  
full HD movies.  Pros and cons to both.     
Con to your Sanyo is the resolution of the stills: 4 mega pixel according to one  
site I looked at.  4 MP is enough picture dots to create a nice A4 sized print.   
Con because the most compact cameras today (which also do film clips with  
sound are capable of 8 to 12 MP off the shelf.   
Otherwise, if you are doing mostly video... then it looks like a nice camcorder.

			I have a Pioneer box with 250Gb hard drive which can do this.  I've mainly used this to transfer from a camcorder 'digitally' to the Harddrive, then onto a DVD.   
I have also used this to make a copy from a Sky Box. i.e. playback the recorded programme which I record to the hard drive, check, then copy to DVD.   
Adverts are NOT removed.  There are some units in Japan I think which can do this, but I think it needs to see a 'trigger' signal before and after the ads which we don't get here.   
I don't know of any box (yet) that can do this for HD (excluding teh HD recorders none of which have a DVD writer installed).  I think the dreambox (still vapourware) could have a DVD writer added to the unit.

			I've been browsing a bit lately with this thread question in the back of mind -- and noticed in particular the threads which mention most swiss apartments have a standard Cable TV connection that you would have to switch off if you didn't want it.   
In particular I was interested to note that these standard connections (according to most posts) include TV and Internet.    
Which begs the question - if I want cable internet, will I automatically get cable TV too? If yes, I guess part of my original question becomes null and void.   
I could use Zattoo to access the channels I need which aren't provided in the basic package...but still have TV with standard channels for no significant extra cost.   
Am I reading the situation correctly? Also, how do I decipher the packages on the Cablecom website? Here in Australia packages are generally based on limited v unlimited access...here it appears it's based on speed..does that mean all have unlimited download?   
Thanks!

			The two non-fta HD channels (National Geographic and Eurosport) will no longer be part of the ""Cablecom Collection"" package.    
Beginning in January 2009 Cablecom will offer an aditional package called ""Cablcom Collcetion & HD"". This package will be 5.- more expensive (SFR 20.-/m instead of 15.-) than the new ""Cablecom Collection"" without the HD channels.   
Also these two channels can be ordered in an ""HD-only"" package (without the rest of the Cablecom Collection SD programmes for SFR 7.50)

			DVICO used to be the reference for media players and still benefit from a more developed user experience however in the latest generation of hardware, the price is unjustified. As an alternative, I've been using the Istar HD mini for some months now. Its a similar hardware platform to the popcorn. I'm quite impressed as it plays preety much anything you throw at it and with the latest firmware even high bitrate mkv's play nicely. Highly recommended if your sources are digital files. There's tons of information about these NMTs (Networked Media Tank) on their official support forum   "	earned the respect of many	Join Date: Feb 2008	Groaned at 2 Times in 2 Posts	Popcorn Hour	szhjcn	Posts: 1,563

			I had this problems a few times with the SD Recorder (ADB). I also had trouble updating the EPG a few times. I usually solved the problem by unplugging the device for a few minutes. After that everything went back to normal.   
Since I switched to the HD recorder both problems have disappeared (replaced by new ones  ).

			My experience was a little different.   
I got a sealed Orange prepaid kit with CHF 20/- in credit through Ebay in mid November.   
I reached customer customer service by email and phone but they told me the serial number was not found in the system and hence could not assist me.    
On my own initiative after about 7 days, I went to an Orange outlet ( near Zurich HB ), presented my ID to a sales rep, and selected a number out of 4 that was presented on the screen. My SIM got activated within 6 hours - received two SMSs which allowed out to use online resources.

			Update: I just got the   phone last week, and it is EXCELLENT!!   The Skype is still giving me problems to cretain countries, but the Siemens VOIP/SIP phone is flawless everytime. And it's one of the few (or only) SIP phones with the G.722 ""High Defenition"" codec. I thought it was just a marketing gimmick at first, but when I made my first call it was a very noticeable improvement in clarity/quality. The only catch is the other end also has to have a SIP phone that supports the codec, but that's ok for me, since the other end I call also has got the same phone   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2008	Groaned at 38 Times in 36 Posts	Call Quality: VOIP/SIP versus Skype	esto	Posts: 1,272

			Short of cutting every cable to the exact length you need or buying new cable the length you need (if they exist in that length).  Then later you make a change and the cable is too short.   
You could add a couple of cable trunking sections that you can put the excess cable into.  Try and keep coils of power cables separate from A/V cable though.   
Locate all your A/V devices separate to you or TV, then use HDMI over Cat 5 to transport the signals to the TV and A/V amp.

			Talking about region encoding, I see the Playstation store additions for Little Big Planet are also region locked. I have a US LBP and a Swiss store account, i can happily browse, download free / paid for LBP content and it simply never shows up in game.   
Happily you can get around this by registering a new PSN ID with a bogus US address for the free content and once the PSN prepaid cards become generally available you should be able to get hold of USD cards and buy the content for the US games.

			Hi janetm   
Does your camera have a night time setting?    
If not, then make sure your camera is stable (on a tripod or very well supported with no wobble)   
Use the exposure compensation setting and put it to-1 or -2. this will ensure that the pics don't come out too bright which can happen with a camera on the automatic setting.   
I couldn't find a pic of your camera but I think the attached picture might be it.       
 The symbol with the plus and minus sign is what you should use.   
Hope this helps and happy shooting.

===By Jeremy Kirk, IDG News Service=== 
  December 04, 2008     
     Researchers at BitDefender have discovered a new type of malicious software that collects passwords for banking sites but targets only Firefox users.   
The malware uses JavaScript to identify more than 100 financial and money transfer Web sites, including   along with two dozen or so  . When it recognizes a Web site, it will collect logins and passwords, forwarding that information to a server in Russia.   
Firefox has been continually gaining market share against main competitor Internet Explorer since its debut four years ago, which may be one reason why malware authors are looking for new avenues to infect computers, Canja said.   
Users could be infected with the Trojan either from a drive-by download, which can infect a PC by exploiting a vulnerability in a browser, or by being duped into downloading it, Canja said.   
When it runs on a PC, it registers itself in Firefox's system files as ""Greasemonkey,"" a well-known collection of scripts that add extra functionality to Web pages rendered by Firefox.   
BitDefender has updated its products to detect it, and other vendors will likely follow suit quickly, Canja said. Users could avoid it by only downloading signed, verified software, but that's a measure that restricts the usability of a PC, he said.   
The malware is not present in Mozilla's repository of add-ons, Canja said. Mozilla had taken steps to ensure that its official site hosting add-ons -- also called extensions -- are free from malware.   
In May, Mozilla acknowledged that the Vietnamese language pack for  
Firefox contained a bit of unwanted code. Although widely reported as a virus, the language actually contained a line of HTML code that would cause users to view unwanted advertisements.   
Mozilla now scans new add-ons for malware. However, those scans will only detect known threats, and there was no signature in the security software Mozilla was using at the time that could detect the code.   
Mozilla said the code probably ended up in the language pack after the PC of its developer became infected. More than 16,000 people downloaded the language pack, but only about 1,000 people regularly use it.   
After the incident, Mozilla said it would scan add-ons in its repository when antivirus signatures were updated.

			I'm often accused of being cynical and unkind to the locals. This is, of course, incorrect. I am very cynical and extremely unkind to the locals (I have my reasons).   
Having said that I must praise Cablecom for my recent encounter.    
I started to have problems with my internet and telephone connection. The sound quality on the telephone calls was getting worse and the intenet connection seemed to be lacking bandwidth.   
I filled in the on-line questionnaire (in English) on Wednesday morning. I got a telephone call in the afternoon and arranged a visit for this morning. When the guy didn't show at the right time I thought I was going to be in for some standard Swiss service. Five minutes later however I got an apologetic phone call telling me he was running twenty minutes late.   
Sure enough, he showed up twenty minutes later. He then proceeded to fiddle around in the way that telephone engineers do for around twenty minutes. He replaced a couple of small pieces and hey-presto I now have much better reception and my bandwidth is, dare I say, impressive once more.   
So, thank you Cablecom. I know you take a lot of flack sometimes but I, for one, have never had any problems with your service.

			Yeah, I have the address registered to my parents. Well anyway, your best bet is to get someone to buy a Vodafone topup voucher and then have them send you the number. You can then dial 2345 or whatever it is (which is free when roaming on Swisscom at least) and enter the number.

US DVDs are region 1, Europe is region 2 so US dvds will not play in European purchased dvd players and vice versa.  However, it is much easier here to buy a ""code-free"" dvd player than in the US - most shops just charge you an additional fee (e.g., CHF 50) to make it code free - you can also do it yourself by finding the code on the internet.

			My latest Cablecom bill has just arrived. I was expecting it to be for 1 month's hispeed internet plus a quarter's rental for my digital TV mediabox recorder (@20 per month).   
Instead, it's now just 1 month's worth of digital TV mediabox recorder rental plus 1 month's hispeed internet charge.   
This is good news, since earlier this year I somehow got hit the same month with both the mediabox rental @ CHF 60 and the Billag bill of CHF 115.50.

I can feel your pain, but try putting yourself in their shoes for a moment.   
Maintaining your account has a real cost, albeit small. Whether for Skype, or for the bank. Which is why every bank will charge you for the privilege of maintaining an account, if for example you just want to keep $100 in it. They all insist on a minimum balance.    
What Skype and other VOIP providers have done is to insist that you demonstrate continued interest in using their service by making at least one phone call in 6 months - which sounds not unreasonable to me...

			Stick the card in the Sky+ box and phone sky to activate the ""+"" bits of the box (recording, live pause, etc.)  This might cost you £10 a month depending on your current subscription.   
You can use the other box to view free-to-air programs without a card (see the link in cecileg's post).   
You will need two LNB outputs for the Sky+ box, so a quad LNB is your simplest solution if you want to have a third output for your old box.

			Thanks both - it was Mr mtc who posted, and after spending a merry half hour on the phone to Swisscom it's all sorted. I don't understand the ins and outs, but am happy as I have my laptop back again   I think it involved changing the settings in both the modem and the router - he was impressed that swisscom stayed on the phone while he messed around with it, in a way that Virgin in the UK wouldn't have done.   
No idea whether it was free or not to call - he went via the 0800 number.

			Apart from the numerous live streaming websites, the best way is really to check on the liveonsat website. If you do not have a satellite dish, then choice is limited to what is shown on the swiss cable. You may be able to watch some Liverpool champions league games on the public channels (or ITV via digital cable), but to see all the CL games and most of the Premiership games live you will need to get Pay TV. On the Swiss digital cable you also have BBC channels showing the premiership highlights on Saturday and Sunday evening.

			Hi,   
I am moving to Basel and last week I visited to sort things out. I thought it would have been a good idea to get a mobile phone number. I just got into MediaWorld at the Bahnhof SBB and asked for a prepaid card and it was really straightforward. I got one from Sunrise for 20 CHF with 20CHF credit and it worked. I do not have a permit nor an address in Switzerland so far. I do not know about the fares to make calls. But they told me that if I recharge 20CHF I can get SMS for free until the end of the year.

			Most routers have a section in their set up called 'port forwarding'.    
All you need to do is find your way to there and in the provided spaces fill in the port number you wish to have 'forwarded' and the name or number of the PC you wish to forward the port to.    
This is how you tell routers to open up ports.    
Good luck

			Why didnt you just change your address back via the cablecom website? that way you know it would have been logged in their system, and you would have received a letter to confirm.    
I didnt think your letter was particularly well worded, and sounding more like a rant than anything else. I doubt you will get very far with that, other than a standard letter stating they received your complaint. And I agree with the above that it most certainly wont be read by the CEO - and you really should have found out his name first!

			Not sure what you mean.   
If this is a Monoblock set at 6.2 degrees (for 13.0 & 19.2) and you now use this this for Astra 2 (28.x) then the second LNB will be 6.2 +/- 28.x (depending which is aimed at 28.x).   
I assume this monoblock just has a single output?  If yes, this will contain a switch to allow a box to select LNB 1 or 2.  This means the decoder needs to be setup to do this via DiSeQ codes.   
If there is more than one output, often Input 1 has to be active (receive power) to drive the switch and second LNB.   
NOt sure if this answers your Q.   
If you are getting Some Astra 2 channels but not BBC, ITV etc.. you eitehr need to fine tune the dish or have a bigger setup as these channels are on a more focussed footprint which we are on the edge of.   
See previous posting with footprints of Astra 2D

			the sky boxes toggle from PAL to RGB only.....Sky+ has a s-video connector but.......PAL or RGB are your options...!   
what you could do is, for example, connect Scart on Sky to Scart-in on a DVD Recorder and piggy-back - but again this might not work.   
Sky HD....you could try   but I think the direct sale of HD boxes from Sky are in short supply.   
Sky Italia just started HD too, and also look at Premiere from Germany for HD.  Or go for UK FTA programming and get the Humax HD box?   
Eschenmoser or Manor or Fust or InterDiscount might help - or surf through   for online shopping....

Anixe channel: 
Astra 1 H,  19.2deg   
11914H  27500   
Hope it works

According to cablecom.ch the apartment I will move to in just over a month's time does not have hi-speed net or digital phone services, but DOES have digital TV.  I'm not quite sure how that works, since I was led to believe that, in order to get cable net access, one only needed to have the cable already installed.  And how else is the digital TV accessible than through the cable...?  Or perhaps, since digital TV implies the cable is already installed, the lack of hi-speed net access means that getting cablecom to put this in place will require less time/work than otherwise (i.e. a hardware install outside of the apartment block only)..?  Any thoughts on that idea?

The unused connectors should be sealed, as should the connected cable (as has been previously mentioned).

			Hello all,   
having just purchased a Sony KDL-40V4000, I am wondering if Cablecom, or the channels themselves, transmits any kind of video test signal that can be used to calibrate my TV?   
I also have a playstation 3 and used the Digital Video Essentials blu-ray disc to calibrate that HDMI input, but would like to do the same for the input from my cablecom receiver (which is RGB via scart). For that, a useful test signal would be required.   
Tried searching, but didn't find anything.   
Thanks in advance !

			The same happened to me. Furthermore Orange ADSL will not give anything in writing. Just on Customer Care I was informed. Its a lesson to learn and all the ADSL contracts are mostly like this. They get prolonged automatically for a further 1 year without any signature. Its important that people should be informed, to prevent these companies to take advantage

			Whew! Got it done in the end but it took most of the w/e.   
The only way I could get the signal strong enough for BBC/ITV was to realign my dish to 28.2°E and then move both the other LNBs (13 &19.2°) to match. Oh, and I had to adjust the elevation to somewhere between.   
Probably would have been a lot easier with your pro meter, OTH, it probably cost more than my dish   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Satellite receiver issue (or non-issue)	kiml	Posts: 9

			Hi,   
In Lausanne, you basically have three options:   
1. CityCable (your need to check with your landlord, if the apartment is connected to CityCable, since this is a service offered by the council) 
2. CableCom 
3. SwissCom Bluewin (you need to have a phone line also for this one)   
Most people go for Swisscom since they offer a stable connection and fairly cheap.

			Hi Stout> I will give the forum a go and see what I can find there, that may apply.   
Hi Esto> I think you may be right on this one, or at least somewhat, since the HD channels do not get activated the first week (if you do the install yourself) since they need to do a proper line test.   
I will hold off with doing anything for now and review when I am back from my business travel.

			For the benefit of anyone else with this issue:  I called Swisscom and they told me their normal contracts are for a year but they can ""make an exception"" for a 6-month contract.  So supposedly the line will be connected when I arrive and it's only for 6 months.

			For those interested in receiving British FTA programs:  Lyngsat pushed a new channel list to their Lyngbox sat receiver last night - now ITV HD is included.    
The Lyngbox also comes with full listings for most (if not all) British FTA channels. The available channels can be found here:    
The receiver can even be programmed directly over the internet.    
I wouldn't recommend the box to anyone using German Pay TV (Premiere) yet - there are lots of bugs in connection with the Alphacrypt and Diablo CAMs. But it's an alternative for those who were contemplating the purchase of a Freesat rec in the UK. 
All in all, it's somewhat buggy - but most bugs are only annoying to pay tv subscribers (e.g. it only tapes one audio channel at the moment - automatic audio channel selection doesn't work on Premiere - but it works on Swiss TV, for example) etc.    
I bought one for the EPG / tv listings but I'm torn whether I should keep it or not - I'm a Premiere subscriber and the issues are very annoying to me.

			Hi, Does anyone know an electrician who would be up for a quick job, cash in hand?   
I have just moved into a new build in north of Zurich and Swisscom transfer my existing internet contract there on the 20th of August. Apparently I need an electrician to connect two wires in the basement.    
From another electrician in another part of CH, ""It is a 10 min easy job and all electicians know exactly what needs doing"".    
In the UK British Telecom normally do this type of thing but it is not the case here.   
Hope you can help as life is not worth living without the internet. I can cope without a phone but not the internet.

			Does your fixed line modem have a router built in? If so, buy a seperate WLAN router (like gregv suggested) and just plug it to a spare ethernet port. ""Wireless G"" (802.11g) standard wifi routers/access points are really cheap now because the N version (802.11n) has a pre-release out now and offers data rates up to 270Mbps, I got an 802.11g AP and USB dongle for 40CHF at Steg ( )   
Almost all 802.11g AP's are backwards compatible with 802.11b so you can use it with your internal wifi card also.

			I've just done a search and was surprised to find no matches for this.   
I use a Mac Mini as a media PC with my HDTV, and last night got hold of an EyeTV 310 to act as a susbstitute Freesat PVR. I'm still playing with it and have a few kinks to iron out, but first impressions are extremely good.   
Has anyone else got or used one of these with their set-up? I'd be glad to bounce a few ideas around if so.

a) will the TV work from 230V? 
b) does it cover the S-band cable channels? 
c) does it support the dual language system used here?      Voltage coverter = transformer, will cost something, how much depends on power demand of TV. Could be a couple of hundred francs. 
Video vonverter PAL to NTSC? Forget it. You'll be forced to use AV-IN, and most of the settop boxes here are PAL output and I don't think they do NTSC.      This is you best choice.

4965	null	null	null	null	"    Comtrend Antennen is a company that supplies antennas and satellite receivers, based in Rüti, Zürich (close to Rapperswil). It is likely that they built, and thus look after, the system in your building   
That means that you likely have a standalone building with distributed satellite reception in the building.   
If this is the case, the dual-sound capability will be dependent on what systems they installed in your building.   
The easiest way for you to get information quickly is to ask your neighbour in the same building, and possibly look at their TV and see what settings they use.

			Hi JelmerF 
If you are in Lausanne please have a look at this page        
CityCable provides a number of channels in DVB-T.    
Cablecom uses Nagra2 to encrypt the channels it broadcasts in DVB-C. As the card is paired with the box you have to use their receiver. There is no other easy and legal choice.

1. YUV ( YPbPr )  video (component).    
2. S-VHS video.   
3. Composite PAL video   
Whichever you use depends on what the beamer has available as inputs.   
Google tells me the Mitsubishi HD1000 has the following:     Connection Panel: One HDMI port, one 15-pin VGA port, one set of YPbPr component inputs, one s-video input, one composite video input, one 12V trigger, one serial port, and one USB port.    
You want to u se the  YPbPr component inputs.   Just purchase the appropriate SCART to  YPbPr component  cable to connect the two. 
As a beamer is normally used to generate  a physically large picture, I strongly recommend you go for the component solution for the sharpest picture.

			That would mean you have to use a box from Cablecom.   
But there are ways to use the card in other boxes. This only opens channels you paied for. This also works for Sky.   
I have no idea how legal it is. It is not ""Erschleichen einer Leistung"". But it does involve ""hacking"" and violpates patents from Kudelski.

			Hi all,   
I recently tried to set up my old pc (runing windows XP) with my CableCom modem. The pc wouldn't recognise the modem, even though I was using it with a laptop at the same time via USB, so there was no issue with the modem.   
Anyway, someone from CC technical, came back with this fix and it worked: Restart the pc and turn off any firewall, turn off cc modem for 20 secs, connect the ethernet cable to the pc, then reboot the modem.    
My pc connected straight away, just like the laptops had, no need for any of the software supplied by CC nothing, so just thought I'd share it on here if someone else has a problem.

I'm with Mark on this one, you should have no problems at all.  They have an active and helpful support forum on their site.  My guess is that your biggest challenge may be remembering what folder you put the old docs in.  Do let us know if you find out otherwise, it'd be a bit of a surprise.

The AV still contains PAL 625-line 50Hz video, so your TV will need to be able to accept 625-line 50Hz PAL signals on the AV-IN   
Your NTSC/ATSC/QAM tuner is worthless here as there is no NTSC or ATSC transmission in Europe. ie: nothing for the tuner to receive.   
Also, unless the TV is multi-voltage, you'll need a transformer to convert Euro 230V to US 110V.

So, I moved, got the errors in moving ADSL fixed (they disabled my static IP address as I'd lose that for vDSL anyway, but forgot to tell me to update the router password), then ordered Bluewin TV self install.  The hardware (router, filters + box) should arrive next week, and a week thereafter my ADSL should ""suddenly fail"" when they cut over to VDSL, indicating the time for me to plug in the new kit.   
As for not offering ADSL over 4 pin, I'm using it to type this message :-).

One of your devices has too much earth current, ie: is technically unsafe   
One house has a safety-detecting breaker (called an RCD or residual current device, designed to protect you from electric shocks). This is doing its job, and switching off the power when it detects the fault.   
The other house will have no RCD and so will have no ability to trip.   
You should get all the devices which were connected to the TV checked: the DVD player, satellite receiver, video recorder, and TV.   
Or connect them one by one, until you find the one that trips the breaker.   
A friend with a multimeter and electrical knowledge could determine this for you very quickly.   
Otherwise, ring your local electrical supply authority - they may well offer free safety testing in their offices / showrooms etc. Ask them.

			Hi Folks, 
So I bought myself a posh wall mounted TV and hung it on the wall with the wall mount the cheerful chap in the shop sold me. Height and everything are perfect.   
The TV is mounted in the centre of a plasterboard wall that is about 5cm in front of the real wall and mounted with massive screws that secure it to the ""real wall"".   
I have multimedia sockets (ethernet, sat, terrestrial tv) and power sockets at each end of the wall.   
I now have to hide cables. I am keen to hide them in the wall itself, this would involve making a hole behind the tele, a wall in the end near the socket and probably several ""access holes"" along the way to allow me to drill through the vertical wooden supports that the plasterboard is screwed to. I'd then plaster up the ""access holes"".   
I thought I could use this method and put a very wide conduit in the wall allowing me to feed cables through at my leisure. Does such a socket exist that has a couple of scart inputs and a couple of HDMI inputs that I could put at each end (socket end/tele end) with a single, multi core cable in between the two?   
What are my options?

BBC airs them about the same time as we do.    Most people here do not know enough English to understand a full movie without subtitles. So it would be a small fraction to watch the movie on BBC.     I saw the movies on Teleclub already anyway, so I would not care too much if they would have to block the movies. I watch BBC to improve my English (News, Talk and so on). For most of that BBC holds the rights anyway.     Switzerland is a country with many nations and so maybe the government also wants diversity on your TV. Dont forget, we are a small market compared to Germany,     And again: BBC came to Cablecom in 2004. You seriously think that they would not notice that 150000 digital TV customers can watch them?   	become a little unpopular	Join Date: Feb 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Cablecom and ITV/FILM4/BBC	Ruedi	Posts: 31

			The general advice i would go for is to get the latest series... there are always improvements, you get a recently made TV, pay a little more but its normally worth it. For example the W3000 had various problems which made some buyers a bit unhappy (clouding and backlight bleed, since you are ""in the know"" about optics)..... the W4000 mostly resolves that stuff.   
Or what about the X... top end luxury so should be the best? Maybe, but it was released more than a year and a half ago now, so its older technology sold at a premium because the frame ""looks"" more expensive. About to be replaced, and the W is already here.   
Of course, it depends on what you are looking for.... what are you looking for?

			For around 100 sFr you can buy a video transmitter that relays the picture and sound from one room to anywhere in your house, and relays remote control commands back.   
This way you can control any box (satellite receiver, DVD player, Cablecom settop box, DVB-T tuner, etc) from anywhere in the house.   
Otheriwise, a second box is required (satellite receiver, DVD player, Cablecom settop box, DVB-T tuner, etc)

			Cat 6 would be enough.   
Cat5e will give you 1Gb network.   
If I was doing this again I would use Cat6 now though.   
After my Hols, I'll review my setup to see if this can be improved security wise.  Best be safe than sorry.   
I need wireless for my remote form Philips (TSU9600) and this is the weakest link as it only supports WEP at the moment.  This needs to access the Philips RS232 extender (mainly controls the multi-channel amps at the moment but also can relay IR signals to remote A/V devices), then I have a Squeezebox plus a Squeeze server running on my NAS which will be accessed via this remote.  The NAS and the Squeezebox need Internet access otherwise I'd just separate them from the rest of the network.

But modern systems utilise path mtu discovery - so long as icmp type 3 code 4 packets ""packet too big"" are allowed to pass between source and destination end to end. This signalling tells the source to reduce the packet size and then you're off!   
Gooner may have the idea! Also, try changing channels!   
For anyone interested in this type of networking - can be fun - I recommend ""Wi-Foo - The secrets of Wireless Hacking"". By a couple of Russian guys. It's an interesting read.

I currently have it hooked up to a PC monitor with the VGA cable.   
I bought the transformer back in the US from this place    
They supposedly do international shipping.  I ordered several transformers from them and so far they are all working fine.

			Echo the comment re Grundig boxes, as ours recently died. Got a nice new Sky + box brought over by a kind relative that they picked up from a local store. Pairing the card was easy, just hide your phone number or use a UK mobile and it takes a few minutes on the phone, and about an hour in order for the change to activate. They will ask for all the details concerning the address to which your account is registered.

It's around $20 for three months (with the current promotion) and gives you three phone numbers within the zone of the ""unlimited world."" One can pay in yearly installments as well.   
For those who still have ties to the US, this is very convenient: you can wait on hold for a bank or a credit card company representative for quite some time and then it will take them hours to verify your identity   For us, it's also useful to have a US phone number, for various reasons. Cell phones in US and Canada (+ a few other countries) are included in the subscription.   
Skype is working even with a not-so-great WiFi connection that we currently have. Also, with this subscription, you can call the landlines in the countries that are not part of the ""unlimited world."" Calling a Moscow landline is, for instance, $0.024 per minute.

			I'm trying to learn French and my reading French is much better than my hearing it. So I use the French subtitles if I get lost with too many words thrown at me at once.    
I know what you mean both about the actors voices and the odd subtitles. They do not translate every word either which sometimes loses the context in the subtitles.    
My Wife is Swiss and has lived in London for 14 years so knows the voices too. It drove her nuts for the first couple of months but eventually settled back into watching the awful dubbing.

			The only way I could suggest is to use a 'Professional Meter' which enables you to select individual satellites, and use this to fine tune the dish.  If you don't know anyone locally with one of these, then call in a professional, but if you do this maybe find someone with experience of using these dishes (maybe ask the company you bought it from to recommend someone if they can't do it for you).

			I am not sure if that would solve the problem as it might have been a faulty chip set.   
If it can be fixed by changing the PSU, I might be able to help you there.  Just bought a new PSU for my Thomson box, but after installation last night the box is still dead.

			Hi,   
Try this website.  It will give you a good idea of where to point the dish:       
Failing that, you might have to get someone in with a meter.  If I lived locally I'd drop by and take a look for you, but if you are still having porblems next time I come donw to Geneva, then I might be able to help out.  Otherise get an engineer over.  Provided everything is setup correctly and working should only take him 30 mins or so.  But if you have other problems would take longer.

			I've seen ribbon power cables in an office I worked in outside of CH. I believe the power is conducted through flat copper sheets rather than standard copper wires. However the cable was quite strongly coated in rigid plastic and not at all flexible and it certainly wasn't thin enough to run under a window/door and allow it to close fully. Also it was internal and I doubt very much it was suitable for outside use. Why don't you call an electrician or go into Fust and ask. As far as electrics are concerned my motto is Live Long and Prosper - ask an expert.

If your TV cannot change regions, then will only work with an external device, i.e. VCR, SatBox etc.. that provides you with a Scart or simular connection. Basically, you can't use the internal tuner.

			I have a similar problem, asked landlord if it was ok to put up a dish and he said no need as have cable. Went out brought a new swiss TV and plugged it in, used auto tune and I have 38 channels. But all in German/French apart from a coupld of shows that are broadcast in 2 languages and I can swap them into English. So have resorted to using one of my old laptops to stream BBC1 and ITV through Zattoo.   
Had heard that you could get bbc and channel 5 through Swiss cable but I cant find them! 
Any suggestions?

			Ok guys,   
I have spoken to my lawyer and the mietverband and its perfectly legal in Switzerland to have a satellite dish as long as its on your balcony and not attached to it. If it says it in your contract that you cant have one dont worry this only applies to Swissys who have already got access to their local channels, as a foreigner you have the informationsrecht to get access to your home tv. My verwaltung also confirmed to me today that the clause is worthless in my contract.   
I am getting my lawyer to write a letter to my verwaltung telling them to stop bothering me about it and I will distribute copies of this to my wonderful backward swiss neighbours letterboxes.    
At last there is an advantage to being foreign here    
This is the final answer for anyone wondering about sat dishes for confirmation they should ring the miterverband who will tell them the exact same thing.

5106	06.04.2008, 22:52	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Winterthur	"    Winterthur is served by Cablecom. You can check the availability of all services on the  , but generally, every location in the city of Winterthur with an existing cable connection should be well served.   
1. Yes, if your TV is a multi-standard TV. Check the user manual, the TV standard used in Switzerland is PAL B/G. The UK uses PAL-I. 
If your TV is PAL-I only, then you can only connect via AV or SCART. You cannot use the analogue tuner. If the TV is PAL-I only, and more than 2 years old, consider selling it in the UK.   
2) As you wish. There are a couple of analogue cable TV English speaking channels, but there are 11 English speaking channels on digital cable TV (DVB-C). Digital free over-the-air (DVB-T) is restricted to just 4 x Swiss channels, plus anything you may be lucky enough to get from Austria and Germany, depending on your location. There is no more analogue over-the-air TV. 
However digital cable TV is encrypted and you must use a Cablecom digital settop box, so there is no point buying a TV with builtin DVB-C digital TV tuner.   
3) Depends what you want to receive. For satellite: shop around. For cable TV: you can only use the Cablecom settop box.   
4) All info is here:   
You get BBC Prime. BBC 1, BBC 2, BBC World, ITV 1, ITV 2, CNN, CNBC, Al Jazeera, Film4, and Fashion TV as native English channels, all included in the basic digital TV offering. 
Plus many programs and movies are shown in multi-language, with English being the most common 2nd language. So I watch Greys Anatomy on SF2 in English.   
5) If your digital radio is DAB, then yes. The Swiss use the same DAB standard. Should work.     
There is a small fee of 6 CHF per month to rent the cablecom digital TV receiver. No recorder function. Full details  . 
If you want the digital receiver with built in recorder (what I have) the price is 10 CHF per month (on top of the satdnard apartment connection fee, which is normally included in the rent), but the first 3 months are half price (or first 6 months if you buy another Cablecom product)   
If you will own your own house/apartment, then you part the standard service fee of around 20 CHF per month (pays for the analogue TV and radio), plus any additional services like digital TV receiver etc.   
Cablecom also do very good internet deals, their internet speeds are fantastic - I get 15Mbps - and the pries are very reasonable.

5108	29.03.2008, 23:27	Senior Member	Thanked 88 Times in 54 Posts	Location: Lugano	"    The box is the receiver.   
In the old analogue TV days, the receiver was integrated with the screen. 
In the new digital world, the receiver is often separate from the screen   
So for every screen you have, you need a receiver.   
Your receiver choices are: 
Analogue, built in 
DVB-C, built in, non-cablecom 
DVB-C. separate, cablecom 
DVB-S, built-in 
DVB-S, separate 
DVB-T. built-in 
DVB-T, separate 
BluwinTV, separate   
The general rule today is to select the screen of your choice carefully, and then select the appropriate receiver for what you want to receive   
The reason is that you expect the screen to have a life-span of around 10 years, but the receiver will most likely change within 3 to 5 years.   
A separate receiver and separate screen gives you flexibility have multiple screens connected to one receiver, or have multiple receivers and multiple screens, all either operating independently, or interconnected   
The old analogue days of one choice only are almost fully behind us :-)

			doubtless BBC News 24 moved to Astra 2D and is on a weak transponder.  Either that or they ceased transmission.   
so the channel no longer exists or your dish is badly lined up (Sky box) or you need to update (Sky box) or re-scan (like john).

			To put it plainly, all Swiss shops selling cell phones  (down by the sea shore?)  will do so with or without subscriptions to the various cell phone providers in Switzerland  (exceptions: Swisscom, Orange, Sunrise, they only sell subscriptions to themselves) . Shop around, example: Nokia 5310 without a subscription costs 499.- chf from    (link doesn't show phone, need to enter Nokia 5310 in search window)  but   sells the same phone for 333.-chf.

			If only. I spent 20 minutes on the phone to cablecom, shortly after I arrived. All of the time was spent on hold or listening to some automated service. The reason I was calling was my digital phone and cable modem didn't work, so I had no choice but to call them from my mobile phone. The cost was about 16 francs - and in my complaint emails (I waited till I went to work to further my complaints by email) I told them of this. It was duly ignored... They did send out a technician pretty quickly though.

			Most people cannot track this, I'm one of them. I could connect my cablecom router to a Cisco router and set up SNMP + MRTG to track the usage but this would be overkill, plus the fan noise would drive me nuts.   I guesstimate I use between 15-20 Gigs a month, mostly on streaming audio (iTunes) and video (Youtube), and now and again DLing the latest Ubuntu Distro. I'm sure there must be some Mac applet that can track my usage... but I don't really care, the internet is there when I need it, so I'm not worried about usage.

If you have multiple lines you can use lowest cost routing (rules which route the call through the cheapest provider), you can also route incoming calls to the correct handset.   
E.g. In addition to our Gigaset IP phones our Nokia phones have a built in SIP client, and automatically join the wifi network when at home. It would be nice if all incoming calls on our Paris number rang the missus phone and all incoming calls on our London number ring mine. All outgoing calls would use Voipstunt unless they were to a mobile phone in which case they could take a different provider.   
In short you gain total control of your telephony.

I thought it was as simple as just getting another subscription regardless of whether there was a SKY subscription registered to that address already. They've pretty much said that it was impossible to do that and the only way to get another box is to get multi-room - and with that, the installer has to come and there has to be a phone line. When I told them that there was no phone line connection near enough, they said that if it's not connected, they will discontinue SKY (rather than charge me for the full subscription - reason being you are only allowed 1 subscription in 1 address).   
So how exactly do people get it done if this was the case? There doesn't seem to be any option apart from go via SKY agents that you recommended....

			To Lob and Eire,   
Thanks for the input. 
Majority of the time in Italy (6-7 months), probably in Bologna &/or Marche area, with about a month in Ireland and same in Switzerland. 
I am currently trying to talk to both Vodafone & 3 in UK about mobile data plans, but it's hard to get beyond the trite ""we've got just what you're looking for, drop into one of our UK stores and we'll solve all your problems"" without providing any info on pan-European costs or reception or speeds or limits or... 
I suspect I'll get the same response from Swisscom, Orange etc, but I'll investigate. 
Seems crazy that some of these IPs operate global wireless networks, but don't want to offer real roaming. It'll only take one to bite the bullet. But in the meantime, I didn't want to plan on internet access purely via wifi access in cafes or internet shops. Looks like it's going to be a challenge! 
Thanks guys. Once again the commercial world lags the personal world.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Pan-European mobile broadband suppliers	El Toro	Posts: 2

			Note that the owner of the building is responsible for all of the in-building cabling, as it physically belongs to him.   
To change the current socket from one room to another is not always easy or possible.   
I managed to do it once where, luckily, I had a socket on both sides of a wall. So all I needed was a screwdriver.   
But sometimes it is much harder than that. 
Wireless solutions vary depending on what you want to do.   
For internet, a WiFi router can be plugged into the existing Cablecom socket and then you can enjoy internet all over the house. Typical routers cost between 50 and 100 sFr.   
For telephone, again you can connect a cordless phone to the Cablecom modem and enjoy wireless telephone throughout the house. costs for a cordless phone are well under sFr 100   
For television, you can use a Cablecom digital TV receiver on the existing socket, and then connected to a wireless video sender, which has a two-way connection for the remote control. Then you can have the TV anywhere in the house.  Not sure of the price of such wireless video senders but they can be found in various shops like InterDiscount. 
If you want just the stone age analogue TV, then it will be much harder. You may have no solution other than extending the cable.   
Depending on the construction of your apartment, such wireless solutions may be the easiest and cheapest way to 'shift' the current cable TV socket from one room to another.

			I know TPN very well, having carried out commercial business with them in the past. Technically, they are very challenged & they have tried to make similar offers in Bern & Zürich from all accounts. Basically it's an attempt to recreate the Municipal WiFi business model which has been such a failure in the US.

There are three LNBs and, from what I can see, all cables lead to the same connections inside (i.e. both flats get the same)

			Thanks folks.  The TV is what I expected.   We'll probably bring the portable DVD player and the kid's dvd's.  (Heck, those are the only DVD's we watch buy now-a-days anyway.)     
It is a shame about the phone, but I guess I am not surprised.     
I'll probably bring over the router.  Rather than looking for a converter for the AC source (it is 120VAC input and 12V DC output), I'll be looking for a local 12V DC output plug.     
Yes, we will be getting a few things shipped over, and we will put some in storage.    
Again, thanks for the advice.

			I popped into Mobile Zone last week to buy a Swiss SIM card so i wasn't spending a fortune on my UK contact mobile. I was expecting the cost to be around CHF 20, but to my surprise it was free!! Interdiscount offer the same SIM card for CHF 20. All i needed was my passport to confirm my ID and the card was activated.    
The SIM also came with CHF 10 already on it, and 25 (i think) free texts per month. Not bad as a freebie.    
Just thought i would share the news, as there seems to be a lot of trouble regarding contract phones and ridiculously long notice periods.    
I didnt do any research as to who is the best service provider, but i have to say that i have no complaints so far.

			Go to talk talk for the cheapest rates in switzerland and get the Motorola Qh9 hand held for free , it can deal with sync to mac or PC , comes with windows mobile , interner browser and you can up load open office no problem  - my experience is that swisscom is expensive , with talk talk you can register your home number and get free calls to and from the mobile 24hrs  - our average bussiness bill was 400.- with scomm we now pay around 180 with internet access from the phone....

			Why DVD Player did you decide to buy ?  Was it region free from the shop ?   
I am having trouble finding a good one, that plays HD-DVD and Blu-Ray and that is ""region free"" from the shop.  Or something that is a HDD Recorder and DVD Player with region free.  Time for another research trip to Inter Discount :-)

Yeah, the cable connections are different for TV and Radio.  Though I'm surprised your cable goes into the Radio port and not the TV port.  Is it exactly the same connector on both ends?  The connector for the wall should look different from the one that goes into the TV.  I've also seen three-connector TV/Radio/??? setups.  I'm not sure what the third connector is used for.  Perhaps it was for a rooftop antenna?

			Yes, Lörrach is just over the border from Basel. At the moment, I have no phone service at home (only moved in at the start of this month) but the last provider I had in Germany was Deutsche Telekom - expensive.   
These international flat rates seem to be rather new (i.e. last few months) in Germany, and I don't know if such things exist in Switzerland - so I just wanted to let you all know that such things exist and may pop up in Switzerland in the future.

			Finally done it!!!!!!!!!!   
It works - as a DVD player and a recorder.   
Step 1. Connect main TV aerial into set-top-box 
Step 2. Connect an aerial lead from set-top-box to DVD 
Step 3. Connect an aerial lead from the set-top-box to TV   
Step 4. Connect set-top-box to TV (AV1) with a SCART 
Step 4. Connect DVD to TV (AV2) with a SCART   
Connections finished!   
The link which I found most useful:-    
However on my TV you have to retune a channel on the TV, so that that channel ""sees"" the Video signal, and in the setup of the TV, you have to tell it to scan AV2 in my case as a MONITOR.   
Also tell DVD to rescan all channels.   
I now can play DVD and record from the TV channels, I still cannot record from the new channels provided by the set-top-box.

Tell the lady at the other end of the phone that you are going to do it, and ""please alert the supervisor and switch on the voice recorder"". Let rip for 30 seconds or so, and then turn back into a polite person and apologise to the lady that she had to hear that language.      My French isn't what it used to be, but it is a very effective weapon against the telephone marketeers. A simple ""Do you speak French?"" in whichever language normally scares them off. I keep expecting to be caught out by someone who does have good French, but so far it hasn't happened.       So far I have had excellent service and no reason to complain. Let's hope that it stays that way.

This is obviously the wrong way to wanto shield ones kids form this and Sex in all it's colours belongs to todays lifestyle ,IMHO it's all a matter of how you talk to your child because in my experience when they know that it's something completely normal and natural to happen, then they don't have the need to make fun of it. 
I my opinion it's the not knowing and then turning it into something bigger than it actually is that makes the kids behave that way.But that's just my 2 rappen worth towards this.

I'm moving into my new aptmt tomorrow and cable is included in the bill...

			Great resource! Thanks for the link!   
However, my vanity request is so vain that I don't want it to be limited to the 08xx or 09xx numbers  ....    
To make the spelling sequence work, I need the Sion/Brig preface 027 to give:   
+41 27 426 9233   
One trick seems to ""find"" that specific number (e.g. getting Swisscom (or OFCOM?)) to make the effort to look for the number in their database) and another trick is to ""obtain"" a Sion/Brig number although I am a resident of Basel. Finally, I would want to quickly port it away from Swisscom to use as a ""call in"" number for my Voip account, but that is ""doable"".   
Some DID or Voip providers already offer a 027 prefix, but are within a designated block of numbers (e.g.   and   offers the same block of numbers) and therefore don't allow the flexibility of complete choice over the number sequence...

			hi salsa lover,   
sounds like you are convincing yourself to go the plasma route.    
im sure that you will be happy with whatever you choose. you do tend to get what you pay for in this field, and also, these TV´s are getting better and better at what they do so it pays to buy the latest. of course, there is also a fine balance to be struck between screen size and cost.   
When your budget is not so big, but you need a big screen, probably plasma is for you.    
When you can afford a bit more, or dont mind having a smaller screen, then check out lcds.   
If you see a good deal on a model you like, then note down the model number and google the model number followed by the word ""review""... then you can get some ideas about what people think of it.    
I personally prefer to go with LCD, i find the picture sharper and more pleasing than plasma. It is true that lcd is becoming more and more popular while plasma is declining. One big reason for this is that smaller screen lcds tend to have higher resolutions than plasma, 32 inches being the most popular lcd size (although now 40 inches is slowly becoming the standard), while it IS true that plasma is more likely to suffer burn in than LCD.... I have seen plenty of examples of this with my own eyes so i dont need to read any big research report.    
Also, dont forget to check out some internet retailers... I can recommend   who do keen prices on both lcd and plasma. They are located in Zug and have a showroom there, so you can normally go over and have a look for yourself.    
If you are quite quality conscious about the picture, then just spend a bit more than you normally would. chf 500 more today might mean that you are much happier with the image for several years.

			It sounds like I will have 2 choices then 'cablecom... does not seems so likeable' and 'bluewin'.  But even with bluewin the channels I saw in their internet site seems a little limited.  I guess I am just comparing it to the Netherlands, where I live now and all the movie channels (really good ones) on standard cable are in English plus you have National Geographic, Discovery Channel, etc.   
I have been reading about the threads on the forum regarding satelites as this may be the best option.  But I am not sure what the deal is with them as I read people are trying to cover them up so they can't be seen from the street?   What goes? Are they illegal or something?

			When you purchase your television make sure it supports 'NICAM' if you want to get one that supports 'Bicanal' or 'Zweikanalton'.  BTW, anyone know the Italian and Romanish words for this?

			Thanks jawbreaker, I've located it now. It's actually attached to the bottom of a boring looking sheet of A4 folded in half, which is why I didn't spot it.   
The infocard itself is credit card sized (once you fold it in half), obviously designed so that you can stick it in your wallet. It also has other numbers on it, one of which is the smart card number.

If you can affford it you can get them at almost any resolution you like. Typically there are two lines of projectors for presentation (4:3 aspect ratio) and home cinema (16:9). The presentation ones are brighter but don't really have good blacks or colours.

			I can't tell you about cost because we've not received a bill yet, despite having the service for about 2 months.  It seems to be a reliable, reasonable product, certainly as good, if not better than what I had in the US (unbundled broadband, cable and landline). Not sure if that says much.    
When we checked prices,  it did appear that quickline was the best deal  - we call a lot to the US. The telephone service is fine - good and clear, no weird echo on the cordless when we're talking to a moblie or to a phone in the US. We have digital TV, but we're borrowing a tiny TV and we just have basic channels. The selection of channels is ok, I guess. I don't watch a lot of TV.  The internet is reliable. There are three internet options - we're on the lowest speed, and it's been up all the time and  certainly no worse than the cable modem i had in the US. When I  connect to the system that I'm working on in the US via VPN, I find it sluggish - considerably more sluggish than when I lived 3 miles away from the system.  We're thinking of upgrading once I start to work more regularly.    
I'm in Bern, btw - Belp, actually. Hope that's somewhat helpful.

Although as a man u fan, you could save money and come round my house for the matches ;-)   
On a typical weekend, you'll get 2 games on saturday and the sunday evening game. Last season there was a lot of occassions when there would be 3 games on the saturday or 2 games on the sunday.   
Basically excellent premiership coverage, usually with either the sky sports or the setanta(?) commentary available as well.  they also cover all the champions league matches across all 3 sports channels.

			Mark you are right, they assign me one IP address only, so I can only hook up one wireless, or multiple networked pc's if I add a switch in between, but not wireless and networked at the same time that does not work.   
So if all pc/macs are networked, I can make them all access internet, but as soon as I use the wireless, I can only make one wireless connected computer work, nothing else.   
If anyone ends up stuck with the same thompson, and cannot get any wireless to work, unplug the thompson for a few minutes as it caches the mac address of the wireless router.   
Oh well, it means I am on the lookout again. Shame because I liked the Zyxel.

			ah, if you are using a WEP key on a MAC (which I don't advise since it's insecure, WPA2 is much better) then you have to add a dollar sign ($) in front of the WEP key otherwise you'll get an error stating the key is not valid. so instead of entering:

you have to enter:

In retrospect, I can't believe my parents tolerated having it on the machine for as many years a they did. (Or, for that matter, that those who phoned us regularly tolerated it. )

			As they said, the Plasma TV will not likely work unless it is multisystem TV. When our last TV died in the US I tried looking for one knowing I'd relocate to Europe, and they're pretty hard to come by. So unless you were specifically looking for one, you don't have one.   
Most electronics manufacturers are wising up to the game and making 100 - 240AC adapters. Not all though. I got a 300, 500, and 1000W transformers and we haven't even taken the 1000W out of the box. I got a little 50w thing in a travel kit that we use a lot. My DVD player uses a measley 7 watts and I've got it attached to a 300W transformer. What a waste.   
Your PC will probably be able to handle both 110 & 240, but be careful, they aren't usually automatic. There's a little switch on the back you have to change manually. If dont...kaflooey.

			I found a way, ok, so if you have a new computer (say you got it a year ago) for example the new HP or any computer that has windows media on it.     
So what you do is pretty simple. Lets just say you have cable, or your neighbor or whomever. 
So you connect the cable to your computer or use an ""antenna"" (a card decodificator is required) 
This is what I do, (legal? dont know. I HOPE!) I have my computer connected to my tv with an HDMI cable. The computer is connected to an antenna and  the cable (that I pay for) I record the programs that I want  
Hence, I dont pay cablecom!  
Im also putting you the TV tuner that you might require   
Let me know if you have any other questions

			Hi,   
I had a similar experience when I first moved into our apartment where they accepted my order online, and then unbeknownst to me they canceled it. I called customer service and managed to get through to a human - I understand and speak reasonable French, so it is a help to get through the menus. I was lucky enough to get an English speaking agent the first time, and they explained to me that although the connection was there the owner of the building had not signed the contract so the street connection had not been made.    
I then explained to the person on the other end, that I was currently receiving analog Cable television so therefore the connection was up and running, and they insisted that it was impossible.    
Bottom line was that they had to place a new order for me. The good news is that I never got billed for the first one. Bad news is they cancelled my second order, which I did not get billed for either, for the same reason.    
I called again and asked for an English speaking agent, and if one was not available at the time, but they were really good about calling me back.   
When I got the callback I placed a new order, and the agent made some special entry on the record, and as they say third time is a charm, I finally got my Highspeed Internet and Telephone service.    
Overall the experience was not good, but the agents were always very helpful.   
Hope you get it sorted. 
Jose

Does it have a setup menu where you can select the country, and is Switzerland on that menu?   
I would certainly try plugging it into the wall aerial socket and seeing if you can tune into anything.

			Hi,   
I've just moved into an apartment in Zurich, and want some sort of broadband access that doesn't involve looking for other people's open wireless networks. However, I only expect to be in this apartment for 3 months (although I'll be in Zurich for longer), which seems to rule out any of the ADSL or cable offerings that all seem to have a 12-month contract.   
So I was looking around for wireless broadband options. So far, I've only found Swisscom NATEL (hideously expensive for daily/permanent use) and Sunrise ""T@KE-AWAY"", which seems reasonable but also has a 12-month minimum contract. I can live with that, but when I do move in a few months I'd prefer to get cable or ADSL than be stuck on a wireless contract.   
So the question that I'm coming to is: are there any other wireless broadband providers worth considering, or is there any way to get a broadband for a shorter time period?   
I noticed that both Swisscom and Sunrise are HSPDA networks; in Sydney there were other network technologies being marketed as iBurst and Unwired, is there anything similar here that I've missed?   
Thanks for any advice, 
Andrew

			I do. I got cablecom a couple of weeks back which also plugs into the TV socket (it was relatively hassle free, except for the 17 Fr. phonecall to tech support - where nobody answered - but that's another story...)   
anyway - I picked up a wireless router (Microspot brand, I think it was - but they had a few) for about 80 Fr in interdiscount in Zurich HB on Saturday - and all you do is plug the ethernet cable into it, rather than into your computer. Not much more to it than that. The configuration is all in English - and it's easy to go wireless (and to stop your neighbours using it!) - so you keep your cable modem which serves the digital phone service too.

			Got one of the pricing guys to do some comparisons, here are the results on ""comparitive"" business packages UK calling Switzerland per minute :     Swisscom UK to CH  1.50 chf     Orange  : UK to CH  1.10 chf     Sunrise  : UK to CH  1.25 chf   
so no surprise there then.

			Try searching on the manufacturers website, you can often download the manuals as a pdf (in english).      They are fixing their problem they are sending you a new box. You can't expect a cablecom technician to fix the box there and then for you if (for example) the electrics are fried. Maybe you could try asking round at your work to see if anyone can help (the inclusion of a few beers may help the offers to come rolling in).

			so what are you trying to receive?  What is your satellite box?  Have you checked all the cable is good, especially to the LNB stuck on the dish?  Is the dish exposed to the elements?   
If it's a Grundig, Amstrad or Panasonic Sky Digibox, I'd say the box is on the way out.

It can be far, far worse for cable service here in Switzerland.  My last place only had CNN, BBC World and BBC Prime as the english channels.  The only plus side to it, was that the community owned the last mile and were in the process of installing an infrastructure to provide all the free-to-air content they could receive.

			Wikipedia is your friend!       
""Regional division""   
The Nintendo DS is   in the sense that any console will run a Nintendo DS game purchased anywhere in the world; it is the same system everywhere. However, the Chinese version games can only be played on the Chinese iQue DS, whose larger firmware chip contains the required   glyph images. Nintendo DS of other regions cannot play the Chinese games, while iQue DS can play games of other regions. Also, as with Game Boy games, some games that require both players to have a Nintendo DS Game Card for multiplayer play will not work together if the games are from different regions (e.g. a Japanese Nintendo DS game may not work with a North American Nintendo DS game, though some titles, such as  , are mutually compatible). With the addition of the  , certain games can be played over the Internet with users of a different region game.   
So the answer is yes.

You'll want to get a Tri-band (900/1800/1900) or a Quad-band (850/900/1800/1900) phone if you want to use it both in the USA and Europe.  Most phones will automatically switch from the 850/1900 to the 900/1800 systems, though I have an old phone that requires being manually set.

			Indeed there is ""some"" Sky+ functionality but you don't really get the full benefit of the box with one input.   
There is NO WAY to record without paying Sky some money. Consider an alternate PVR which can use the NDS card - Dreambox 7xxx with HDD springs to mind (as it is one of the few which can keep the card alive with the right emulator).

In reality the price is half that quoted ie a 3.5Mb for SFr. 49 = £5.6 per month... And if you were to use the cheapest you would be down under £ 2.50 per month which equates to 7th palce...

			Bottom line: The dish provided to you sucks cuz you won't get any of the programming you want from it.   
Some alternatives:   
1. Get a SkyTV box. SkyTV is pretty much just US programming anyway. This is the most conventional approach (and most expensive). You'll need a 90cm dish and the correct line of sight.   
2. Get a sling box ( ) and have a friend in the states hook it up. Not as good quality or framerate as a SkyTV box, but close enough. Only thing that sucks is you are off by 6-9 time zones :P Attach a TIVO to get rid of that problem.   
3. ITunes. Pretty sweet actually, but the cost of buying episodes adds up fast.   
4.  . Takes about an hour to download an episode free of charge.

			Problem with Digital+ is that the k*ys change very often, even thought it would be a pain in the rear end to update these everyday or two, I really wouldn't mind. However, when I mentioned it to my wife: its easy: just go to this URL, download this file, convert these HEX numbers to decimal, and enter them in the receiver ... I got that ""you are joking right?"" look  .    
Sad thing, is that we really want this, mostly because we want our 21 month old son to watch TV in spanish.    
Anyhow I tried my luck and called Digital+ customer service in Spain, after a useless 10min discussion with the Techie, arguing with him that I would only need the SmartCard, I talked with his supervisor which gave me a better answer: Its not because of technical reasons but because of legal restrictions: copyrights/royalties are paid for viewing those channels in Spain only, and besides he cannot draft some sort of contract were due to the location he could not offer any warranties over the service.    
I found however another company in Switzerland that might be able to help  , I am still waiting for a quote though.

			Dragon CAM and T-Rex are one and the same. 
Super T-Rex is the next gen card and if you're loading Predasaur firmware, you have a Super T-Rex.   
With your freesat from sky card, you will get C4, five, five US, five life and Sky Three.  However the CAM will not keep the card alive and you'll have to use a Dodgybox to bring it back to life.   
Ever thought you should have asked first?     
Mind you, the only thing that will keep it alive is a Dreambox or Dodgybox.

			If you want Astra2 and Hotbird, you want PRIME FOCUS to be Astra2. Line that up correctly first and then work on Hotbird.       
This is mine to give you a clue.  From L to R is 28/19/13 east.   
I did have a multifeedhalter like yours many years ago.  I found I had to bend it downwards on the Hotbird end to get a decent signal.

			I can confirm that although the Bluewin-supplied ADSL and VDSL routers have WiFi, you can't stream TV over this as the available bandwidth is just not high enough (whatever the over-inflated claims are!) You HAVE to connect the router and the Bluewin IPTV box with a conventional Ethernet cable.   
One trick used by the Bluewin installers is to move the incoming telephone cable to a point behind the TV. This cable is just a thin copper pair and is easier to hide than an Ethernet cable. Sometimes a (now defunct) TV antenna cable duct and socket can be used to reroute this cable.   
Once the router is thus connected with the phone line behind the TV, one can then use a very short patch cable to connect the IPTV box. PC connections to the router can then be made wirelessly, as the limited speed of WiFi is not usually an issue when browsing/emailing.   
The only remaining issue is telephones. I simply hooked a Siemens Gigaset Dect cordless base to the incoming phone line - problem solved.   
HOWEVER - if you can't use the solution outlined above, Swisscom are actively testing (6/07) an alternative that involves using a very thin plastic optical fibre (just 1.5mm dia) as an Ethernet extension. This is also a Siemens Gigaset product, which rejoices in the (English on the box) product name ""Gigaset Optical LAN Adapter Duo"". The product consists of a cardboard box that contains two identical small white boxes with indicator LEDs. Each box has an Ethernet and a fibre socket, and needs volts from a small wall transformer. No configuration at all is required - it's quite literally ""plug and play"". So the connections are: Router Ethernet socket via Ethernet patch cable to white box, to fibre (30m suppplied - user can shorten), to 2nd white box, to 2nd Ethernet patch cable and finally to the IPTV box. The 2 short patch cables, 30m fibre, fibre cutter, wall transformers and English/French/German instructions are all in that single box.   
I don't know where this can be purchased as the one I have I'm testing is here in my office/lab, but Siemens Gigaset stuff is freely available in CH. I also don't (yet) know if Swisscom will sell or provide this as part of the Bluewin TV install service.   
Note that this Gigaset product allows you to extend ANY standard Ethernet up to 30m using a very thin fibre, so it's uses are not limited to IPTV. I imagine it could be pretty useful to renters who need to easily extend a true 100Mbits/s Ethernet invisibly around an apartment and can't/don't want to use much slower WiFi. It also doesn't care at all about Mac/PC/Linux issues! For the tecchies, it's IEEE 802.3u.

			oh Brett, I suppose I have to be nice to you or I'll see red tonight.   
Activate the HD box in the UK.  Can't stress that enough.     
Dishes are typically offset (or off-centre as the picture on the wiki suggests).  So the signal is coming from the sky (hence their name, clever huh?  ) and thus when a dish ""appears"" to be pointing at a building, it might not be.  Certainly if you have distance on your side.   
Some dishes I have seen which are pointing at nothing.  Badly-maintained and not needed.  But the norm is that they all point at *something*.

			One would think though, in an area titled TV/Internet/Telephone that some valuable information exists. That it might be worthwhile reading that before asking such a broad question. There is no point in regurgitating information without knowing how up to date the existing information is.     
You can guarantee that in the existing threads, no matter how old, you will find and be able to compile a list of providers which you could then set about using to research the most current offerings.

5339	05.06.2007, 20:52	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: lausanne	"    Hi.   
All DSL over a phone line at the moment is done through Swisscom - up until very recently they legally owned the so called ""last mile"".  The upshot is, if you get a connection using a phone line  from anyone, you will have to pay Swisscom for the line - 25.25 I believe for analog.  To have DSL from swisscom will cost you more of course.  If you opt for DSL from say sunrise, you will then pay for that on a separate bill (but still the 25.25 from Swisscom).  There is ongoing legal challenges to this crazy situation.  Hopefully the situation will be completely different by the end of next year and the consumer will benefit from real competition  .   
If you go for a cable option, e.g. Cablecom, then you pay only them and will have 1 x bill.   
In all cases, be careful what you choose.  I would not recommend a pay as you go type deal, these almost invariably work out more expensive for the consumer than an unlimited usage deal.

   Nintendo do make some really nice games though, even if the hardware isn't always the most advanced.  For the last year, my most played system  has been my Gameboy Micro.  Not much to speak of in the gfx and sound dept but some really great, playable games.  Being able to play it when on the train or other places where you sit for a while (ahem) has probably helped it get a lot of extra playtime though     Of all the new consoles, the PS3 looks the most appealing to me but I suspect that the fact that it's soooooo expensive will put many off.  The many delays, especially for us in Europe, will have put it at a big competitive disadvantage.     
   Not too enamoured of the MS Zune.  It's bulky for a modern HDD jukebox and MS really screwed a lot of people over by introducing a new DRM format and abandoning compatibility with their own 'Plays for Sure' standard which they had been pushing for a couple of years    
   I would certainly buy an iPod over a Zune any day but hopefully my trusty iRiver 140 will serve me for a few more years yet......  With any luck 40gig flash drives will be common when it finally 'kicks the battery'.

I'm not going to mislead you and tell you what a great product we have or anything - I don't know how our prices stack up to the competition, as I've only been with TIC for a month and haven't worked with our last mile connections yet. However, I do know that we operate pretty slim margins on the products I *have* worked with, so I'd imagine our prices are in line with others,

Unfortunately I'm not sure how much longer it will last and if they will replace the ""special"" with a comparable plan.

			Help! I have tried on several occasions to set up and adjust my bluewin.ch account. I have a basic e mail, but seem to be unable to access the other e mail accounts that accompany mine. Plus, I can't seem to sort out my Vista e mail system which has a fault but god knows what I do to resolve it. Does anyone know of someone who can come and sort this mess out? I am not bad, but the complication of computer probs and language lack of have ment that I know now that I am stuck. 
Thanks

			Hi LOB and everyone.  I have found a solution.  It is a kludge but it works.   
If I want to tape something onto my DVD recorder and I will not be there, I put in 2 programs for the time.  The first one I enter in the planner for recording must be the program I want the tv to switch to.  The second can be anything.    When you have 2 programs recording at the same time, and the tv is on a different channel, it will switch the tv to the program you first entered.  (not the first one in the list)   
I then just delete it from the skyplus box after.  This allows the tv to change when I am not in the room.     
It records to the dvd-r, so I do not have to copy it later.   
LOB - thanks for the hard disk forum input.  I read it, and found a company in zurich which has a large hard disk for the sky plus box for 100chf plus shipping.     
kind regards 
swissmiss

			Hi,   
This has been discussed all over the forum and I tried to go thru multiple posts... still confused.   
I am moving into new apartment. Need to get phone, internet and TV service.   
I cannot install Satellite dish, so I need cable TV. On the Cablecom and Swisscable websites it says that at my new address service is unavailable. The previous tenant had cable TV, I know that.   
What would you recommend for TV, internet (DSL, I guess since cable is not available) and fixed phone?   
I guess since it looks like I won't get cable it pretty much leaves me with Bluewin for everything.   
Thanks.

			Both POTS (analog) and ISDN (digital) lines are available in Switzerland. The analog option is cheaper and more common.   
If your phone is powered from the line, it should work. If it is has a locally powered base station (DECT) or answering function then you will have a problem with the 230v power.   
That being said my advice would be, don't bother bring such small things. Have a garage sale sell them off and buy some new ones here, because you will at the very minimum need to buy new cables or converters from RJ-11 to the local connector (TT) here.

I now get all channels with no breakup in bad weather (excepting thunderstorms and blizzards).   
 And as you say, Sky+ is great and actually makes the Sky service more value for money.  I still think it's a bit of a ripoff though.  If I was in the UK I'd ditch Sky and go Freeview with a suitable PVR.   
  To the OP: Putting a dish on a balcony, assuming it faces the right way, is surprisingly easy.  Just get a vertical mounting pole and screw/drill it into a paving slab.  Then run the leads under your balcony door using a short, flat cable specially designed for the job.  No changes to your doors or building required, which should keep the owners of the building happy.

When I first got a phone that could handle GPRS I used it extensively for the first month and a half:  MMS, email client on phone,  internet connection for PDA, WAP browsing etc ... until I got my first Sunrise phone bill.   
  That put a quick stop to all things GPRS.   
  Later, I had to use GPRS for about a week when my cable internet got blocked (good old Cablecom canclled  access because another user didn't pay  bill, great going!) and the costs of just using it to collect and send email from my PC over an 8 day period were horrendous.   
  Mobile phone companies should be encouraging customers to use additional services that generate new revenue streams but their pricing on data services is quite literally prohibitive.

Hello Aline,   
Be very carefull with what you read on Cablecom website....  what you have seen  only means that you might have * the possibility * to get hispeed. The site only says that you can have, not if it is installed or not. There used to be a small disclaimer about it.    
In case you are the misfortunate first customer of the building to request it, you might have to face a 12 week delay before they sort out things with the landlord (contracts have to be signed, etc), and install the amplifier. I can tell you that it took them 9 weeks to have the whole thing done.    
In despair, i ended up to go for Swisscom. It took them less than 24h to have the phone connected and 5 working days for the ADSL, including the new modem.   
If you call cablecom, the most likelly thing is that they answer that a technician will have to check. Then start counting. I would recommend that you contact the landlord to double check if hispeed is indeed available. Also try to get the name of previous owner of the flat. It would make your life much easier.   
In any case, good luck with both move and internet conexion.

			Hi all,   
thank you most kindly for your answers! I´m in Sweden right now and are going down to purchase the box. From your information it seems I have a good chance of success.   
For anyone else who is interested in watching tv from your homecountry when travelling etc. I recommend you look at   or co.uk. The picture size you can get with OK quality is not even full screen laptop but still it could be interesting for some of you.   
Kind regards,

			Does anyone know of a reputable Sat Installer in Basel - Looked in the threads for recommended installers but none for this area.   
Got the dish, box, cable............., compass.....................sat finder.................etc.   But can't get a good position to get a signal so will need a pro install somewhere on the roof, (hopefully.......landlord willing)!   
Any suggestions?

			Has anyone had reason to buy a telephone amplifier adapter? If so, please point me to the merchant.   
I've got a Swisscom digital phone that isn't made for a headset. I understand that I can plug a headset into an amplifier adapter, which plugs into the phone, and use it that way. But neither Swisscom nor any of the electronics stores have the adapters. If anyone has found one, please let me know where.   
Thanks,

			OK, so now we have a digital cable reciever, which will apparently spring into life in 2-3 days time, so thanks for that. What is the simplest way to record from this? I am used to Sky + (spoilt I know) and had a DVD recorder 3 /4 years ago which was a real pain to use. I need something that is idiot friendly, whether it goes to a hard drive or DVD I don't mind. 
Suggestions will be very gratefully recieved.

			So has anyone had any luck using a dvb-T freeview card in switzerland? 
I got this card with my laptop when I bought it in the UK.. but in Switzerland, when I scan for channels, I get nothing. I dunno if it's the software that's the problem (I'm running Vista and I've tried using Windows media centre and also the hewlett packard player thingy).. 
Are there actually 2 different types of aerial? 
I plugged in the aerial from the TV in my flat into the card.. it works fine with the TV.. but not sure if my card is expecting a different type of aerial.. 
Anyone got any ideas?

It is a global problem. Virgin/NTL in UK are in the similar situation.   
Is it really that simple to Hack codes of cablecom or any other provider? I have never heard sky complaining about hacking.   
Cablecom should change the IT coding team in there company or sue the software code developing firm.

In terms of the s/w im not sure about this - to install I just connected to the modem and ran some s/w. I had another problem with network speed once the laptop was runing on batteries but this was due to power management settings.    
I have an initial issue with locating the WLAN which takes me 5 - 10 mins and secondly the WLAN occasionally drops connection (could this be interference from the selected radio channel ?)

I'm sure you remember the chaos of setting up that you'll have had to go through before and all the things you need to learn to do at once, especially with an apartment!      
I think I WILL phone cablecom closer to the time I move in, but regardless of the language or country, I've found it always helps to know something beforehand, as it's in any company's best interests to keep you believing they are the best/only etc option.  And whilst in Switzerland I have had some frosty receptions when I professed to not know the proper system when talking to various agencies - even when using my fair understanding of French!  That's something that's surprised me here - often there is sympathy for language issues, but not so much if you don't know the processes.     
Thanks to all for the responses to my queries so far - I've learned a lot.  I've been passing what I learn on to the seeming flood of new postdocs arriving in Lausanne recently also, so any advice given here is reaching at least 3 or 4 people.

			FYI for next year- you can also watch the Superbowl on regular French channel TF1. For the french speaking region this is much easier to watch! They started broadcasting with the 2006 Superbowl.   
Also- if you live in or near Geneva, you can watch NFL games every Sunday at Pickwick Pub.  They received Sky Sports satellite so you can check out the schedule each week on Sky, and those will be the games shown at Pickwick.

			Hi All, 
I have been checking this site regularly but this is my first post. I am in a trivial situation, in which I would want to know your opinions and suggestions. In Dec 2005, Even though I did not register to cablecom, I got a parcel from them and I accepted from the post office as I don't know where it come from. Soon, I sent them emails about this issue and told them to cancel this and let me know the address to which I have to send the kit. They sent me back mail to say that I have to send a written and signed letter to them (weird as I did no signature on any paper, but still got the kit...). So I did. They courteously told me that the cancellation is accepted but I have to pay for one year as the minimum contract is one year. I called them and tried to explain them and couldn't get a proper response. I was just getting bills but I didnt want to pay them, as I had never ever connected thru the cablecom network (Funnily, I had another internet from my apartment owner for the whole apartment ..which is thru the phone line). Also mine is a furnished apartment and I dont have a contract with my owner, as I knew him thru one of my friend. So I don't pay for the cable and is not in my name...    
Later cablecom passed on this issue to a debt collector agency, I still didn't know what to do.. Sent them mail asking for the copy of my signed contract, they never came back on that, And I sent back the cablecom kit to the person I was corresponding in Cablecom (As I didn't know the logistics department address). Even after doing all this, I had no solution and now I was getting my bills from the debt collector agency with all the added amount.   
Recently, I got a letter from the office de la pursuites. I sent back the letter saying I oppose to pay. I am sure this issue is getting bad to worse each time and I am not able to solve it. I just want to finish this issue. 
What can I do in this situation, what is the best step to take? I have a L permit and I also want to know if this would affect my extension of the permit.

			[quote=cantarell]Well, I tried I really did, but NONE of the channels I tried (which was a lot) had subtitles for any of the programs on at the time, no matter which page I tried. I checked with the Kabel 1 website and it said 149 .... but no cigar. That page does not exist. This kind of thing happened for every channel  [/quote   
I am living in Germany, and as many of the others have said the number of subtitled programmes on the German channels is really LIMITED....honestly it´s quite rare to find a subtitled programme on these channels. I actually wrote to a number of the channels, because like you I thought having the subtitles would help me learn German, but in general companies like RTL, etc are not interested because of the cost and the way their teletext systems are organised. On Kanal I and Pro Sieben I think some of the movies are subtitled, ARD and ZDF have a few more programmes (e.g. some of the news programmes)...but other than that there is nothing   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Activating subtitles?	cantarell	Posts: 69

			Hmm, no haven't yet, but thanks for the heads up, I will keep a good eye on them! When the other party did not hear you (which I never had and I have been calling everywhere overseas), are you sure it is not your pc, because you need to enable your microphone boost in the audio setup.   
One thing I forgot, you only have 100 free days I think after that you pay but it is not much, I think a few cts / minute.   
But to the guy who also has the zyxel, if you don't use voip through the plug on your modem, yes it works, but the poster here wants this kind of setup.

			These kind of developments will probably signify the start of Billag charging for people with only computers in the house and no tv, as they said they would charge this way as soon as availability of receiving tv over the internet would match the technology   .   
addition: Cablecom subscription is required, and at a minimum of 2000 kb/sec too, so anyone at lower speeds cannot access this site...like me.

			Hi all,   
Thank you for the feedback so far... I finally bit the bullet and after several attempts and issues with Cablecom, I got the Digital box (I might start a separate thread on this but apparently our landlord does not have a contract with cablecom, so we could not get digital cable for ourselves!). So far (I got the box on Thursday) I have been quite disappointed with what is available in English language. Also it is very hard from the program guide to see whether or not a program will be available in English.    
I stumbled across The Simpsons on Friday afternoon, and despite the fact that the cable box indicated that the program was in English, Homer was still talking German.   Very annoying.   
There are also issues with the channels which are 'Dual' based where the option is not for a specific language, but for ORG (which I assume stands for Original) - since the cablebox does not automatically switch to that. National Geographic being one of those.   
I have to say that the only thing which I have been impressed with is the performance of the processor in the box. It seems like it is quite a beefy CPU. Compared to my HD-TIVO in the US this box is extremely fast.   
History Channel, Playhouse Disney and Toon Disney are not available in English - which seems ridiculous to me as they almost exclusively broadcast shows and documentaries which were originally in English and dubbed.   
I have written to Cablecom to complain, but I am sure the complaint will fall on deaf ears.   
Jose

			They did that to me 1 year ago. It worked a treat and now I have a package. Interesting because I waited until after the package was removed then they sent me a 1/2 price special offer. This offer is the best that Sky have and it is strictly for new customers only. I am only paying £9 a month at the moment for a 4 package. Moral of the story: Wait for Sky to send you the special offer in the post (to your UK address of course!).

5454	null	null	null	null	   As of April 2007 Cablecom is the cheapest alternative. You can buy a set top box for CHF 150 and receive 93 digital channels including BBC 1-2, ITV 1.-2, Film 4 , BBC World and BBC Prime. There are no additional costs other than the cable connection which is included in the rent. With Bluewin you need to have a telephone and Internet connection running up to CHF 63 a month. While Bluewin TV have more UK channels- ITV 3-4, BBC 3, Sky News- they don't have BBC 1. Cablecom in addition offer the fastest Internet connection for less money. Premiership football will be on offer as from the Autumn via Teleclub which can be received with the Cablecom set top box.  	null	null	null	If you can't get Sky what do you do?	guest	null

From the coverage prospective Swisscom have more sites than any Swiss providers. You can consider this option as a plus if you are travelling or driving a lot within Switzerland. Otherwise in the big cities penetration ratio of all providers are roughly same.

in addition, this year we will see the emergence of hdmi 1.3, which improves both sound possibilities (Dolby Digital TrueHD and DTS-HD) plus adds possible picture enhancements (deep colour and broader colour space).

			That's what was driving me mad about the previous config, especialy on SF2 where start and end times seem to fluctuate a bit.     
Now there's and option to set the channel, with precise start and end times, and a repeat if required.   I can record blocks as long as I like and get multiple shows from the same channel, the only annoying factor is that it no longer has a nice title, only the channel and date.   
Still a bit lame though, my old Thompson freeview box used to do be able to record programs one after the other with overlap, and adding blocks used to let me set a title too.

			Because of the terrain and the unsightliness of TV aerials, Switzerland has long preferred their TV though a cable. Some communities forbid TV aerials - though they now allow dishes.   
I have a digital terrestrial receiver (presume it's DVB-T) and can get 4 Swiss channels (DRS 1 & 2, SRG and Italian Swiss) in perfect quality and dual language when available from an antenna about 30cm long on the floor not pointing at anything.   
I got the CHF99 box for digital radio - but there doesn't seem to be any at all here yet.

			yes, possibly. 
Distribution amp is an option as is having multiple boxes.  Doing switching off the LNB gives a lot of flexibility - but distribution of a couple of sat boxes giving two distinct channel options is another.   
personally I'd get 19east Astra1 covered too - and certain boxes that accept softkeys like the Dreambox, TM1500, etc.  But this means more expense....box-wise and LNB, switch, cable-wise.   
You're looking at wiring anyway so the choice is prepare for distribution before or after decoding....

But you should know. So go here:     
You can also go to the network analyzer website (the link is on the website above) and see all the information that is available to the sites that you browse. Then install tor, enable it and see the difference. You can also buy one of the other software on the webiste for a fee (small one), and makes your life pretty convenient (speeds up your browsing).

			I'm looking at buying a LCD TV also.  Price and lookswise the  SAMSUNG LE-40F71B is looking quite good because it's 1080p and about chf3000 from toppreise.   
As a source I use sky+ only, which I will upgrade to sky+ HD, but the HD content I will watch is only likely to be sport and the odd movie, which is only about 20% of my viewing.   
My questions: 
1) is there a better screen around at a similar price (or lower).  (I'd prefer a 42"" but these seem much more expensive for 1080p) 
2) as 80% of my viewing is in SD, will be upscaling make SD look like a dog's dinner?  Would it be better to buy a 720p screen for a better picture 80% of the time and slightly lower-res compromise for 20%?   
Thanks in advance for your help.

   For example, I had BT broadband installed at my parents' place and it works out at 23 gbp per month (56 CHF) for 6 meg ADSL, with an included VoIP service that gives free evening and weekend UK calls with rates comparable to Skype for other calls.  I get 250 mins a month of time on their openzone system of WiFi hotspots as a freebie.  They also gave me a free wireless hub with the VoIP functionality when I joined.   Finally, BT have a really good Usenet news service provided by Giganews for which you'd normally pay about 10 dollars per month.   
  This compared to 80CHF per month that I was paying in Zuerich for cablecom 5 meg broadband (inc. the hire of the modem) with no extras.     
   That's a pretty good deal BUT the Broadband is limited to a pretty paltry 6 gigs of traffic per month before they start thinking about forcing you to move to a more expensive service or charging you per meg.   
  The Cablecom service was unlimited traffic (on one occasion I managed to use about 40 gigs in a month but 10-15 was typical) and I could have saved 15CHF per month by buying a cablemodem outright instead of renting it from Cablecom.     
   The thing about the UK though is that you have a huge choice of ADSL providers.  Plus many companies give you 'free' ADSL if you take up another of their services.  eg. 'Talk Talk' from Carphone Warehouse or Sky Broadband.  If you are prepared to do your homework, chances are that you can get a better deal that Switzerland but if you just want no-fuss broadband then the Swiss model might be better.

			I last invested in my home cinema some years ago but I used Fischer HiFi on the recommendation of some Swiss gadget geeks i know. I travelled down to their main store in Altwis and the service was excellent. They even loaned me a van to get the stuff back home at no extra charge.     
I saved a wack compared to retail prices in other stores at the time.    
I'm not sure if they are still price-competitive some years later but it's worth checking out.    
Let me know how you get on though and which model you buy ... as i'm thinking about the same in a couple of months.      www.fischerhifi.ch    "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Nov 2006	Groaned at 34 Times in 31 Posts	1080p TVs	cyrus	Posts: 2,872

			yesterday evening I saw that Cablecom are announcing the arrival of ITV1, ITV2 and Film on 4 digital channels 67, 68 and 69 starting January - replacing the C more film channels that used to be on those slots   
for me that's a massive improvement in viwing choice - even if the programmes are crap at least I can understand them - just the prospect of watching the Grand Prix season alone is a major plus

			You can get Supersports throughout the African continent and as far afield as Dubai.   
However this doesn't include Switzerland.   
Sky Sports (UK) covers rugby and cricket as follows: 
- most test and ODI cricket 
- Rugby - Guinness (English) Premiership, Heineken Cup, some Saffi league rugby, Super 14 etc.   
You can get Sky Sports semi-illegally in CH, but it's quite expensive.  Otherwise, find a pub or a friend with Sky Sports.   
PM me if you want more info on getting Sky Sports.

But for those with ""real"" systems, tune into 11475v, Signal rate of 3151, FEC 3/4 and you should find something labelled GCUK4.

			OK, warning , swiss mobile users overpaid several million francs more for mobile calls than the european average , according to the offtel here.   
I can say from over 10 yrs swisscomm experience that it´s a mine field here and there are still some big coverage issues .   
I had a great service from orange but had to switch back to swisscom due to lack of network where I now live.   
Sunrise is good for prepaid .   
DONT use your swiss mobile in europe ..... way way to much    
Wireless networks and skype to other networks you will save a lot of money.

   Did you ever try the Dragon CAM with a bona-fide Sky UK card?   
   Supposedly you can use it to get the Sky channels.  Teamed up with something like a Dreambox or Topfield it would be great and a serious alternative to a Sky+ box.   
   I thought about it but went for Sky+ in the end as it was guaranteed to work in the long term.

			hi thambo,   
that is a nice TV, you should be happy.   
you can always spend more that that, but i wouldnt recommend spending much less. on the other hand, prices for such tvs are dropping as time goes on... you might get an even better deal after christmas.   
2 hdmi should be enough for the time being. i dont know of any tvs that offer more than 2 hdmi.   
its only annoying that HDTV hasnt made its way here yet. rumours it would be here in 2006 obviously laughable. cablecom hints at 2007 but im not sure.   
ps3 will output 1080p no problem. xbox 360 also recently had an update to allow it to process 1080p (firmware update).    
1080p being the ""best"" (open for argument) possible picture, and the only way you will see it very soon is through a games console. not sure how long it will take for hd dvd and blu ray players to become available and affordable outside of that.

			A fine and interesting description of setting up a satellite receiver and dish.   
I found the site I was looking for  with regards to setting up the dish. 
The URL is    
Please check your location and the altitude of your residence above sea level and please report in which boxes you'll find the approx. values of a compass bearing of 152 and elevation of 32.

All the satellite dishes in our apparment building used to be on the outside wall and everyone was forced to remove them or install them on the balcony instead a few years ago. This was primarily for esthetical reasons.   
It was a hassle to remove and re-install it on the balcony floor instead, and since then reception has been slightly impaired (i.e we can't get certain channels anymore) so if you live in a building it might be best to check up what the landlady says.

			At least you get to see the Swisscom bill and know the cost is there.   
I have friends who don't own a TV and have paid the hidden Cablecom TAX in their ""Nebenkosten"" for many years.   
I also get Cablecom this way, but I do have a TV and watch it. However, I would maybe like to move to Bluewin TV, but don't want to pay for TV twice! I don't know what the break down of my nebenkosten is and can already imagine what my landlord will say when I want to cut the cablecom part out.

Thankfully through German sky I have found a man called Patrick who is english speaking, has a shop in Zug and can sort out my sky dish, tv, telephone and internet in one hit, so I will be paying him a visit needless to say and have my fingers crossed that he is as useful as he sounds.

			Just be aware, there are more than one Astra satellite.    
The UK channels (Sky) are on the satellite Astra 2A which is at 28.2 degrees East.   
There is astra 1 which is the German channels which is at 19 degrees East and hotbird at 13 (German/ French and Middle East) degrees East.    
What I am saying is that if you point your dish at the UK channels ie Sky which has a number of subscription HDTV channels then you will not  
be able to pick up Astra one and hotbird via the same dish.

I managed to re renter the PIDs and VIDPIDs  and other settings and now have my radio stations back.

			Hi, there 
I am wondering whether someone with children could help me out with some info. My brother and his family live in the U.S., and I have bought a DVD recorder to tape German TV shows to support his daughter in learning German (she also goes to German school, and my brother tries to speak German, but that is not always easy as his wife speaks none). Of course, kids should not watch too much TV, but their rule is that if she does, it has to be German.   
So, here is my question: Could you recommend some shows that you find especially helpful for kids to watch when they are in the process of learning German? My niece is 3.   
Obviously, being single with no kids, I am completely unfamiliar with these shows.   
Thanks a lot

Didn't get anywhere near the advertised rate, and found that the rate depends very much on whatever cabling and other electrical stuff was in between. I found that on one end I had to plug the thing directly into the wall - if I plugged it into a powerboard there was no connection possible.

			I've got the same problem, shitty signal I imagine. It's still far from unwatchable (I'm watching baseball) but it is annoying. We're also on a few second delay, interestingly enough. I was watching the Detroit-NY game while on the phone with a friend watching it in the states.

   Likely course of action would have been:   
Employ services of lawyer. 
Have lawyer write however many letters you need to (much CHF) 
Have lawyer bring it to trial (yet more CHF) 
Then possibly: 
  have Vendor relent day before trial, leaving me with no option but to swallow my costs or bring seperate court action to get them. 
or: 
  Have vendor appeal verdict.  Then take whole thing to higher court   
and so on.....   
In the end, it was easier to just get the repair done.

			A shit this hurts...   
I must admit having 4 domains with Mark it is gone down unscheduled 3 times in the last three years and on a few occassions where there have been problems Mark has resolved them late at night and on weekends 
 - mail file corruptions, strange results after an upgrade, me being stupid - though that one was somewhat harder.   
So if you are wanting an independent reference I will give it...   
Oh boy that hurt...

			CNBC is still available, but only to digital subscribers... I guess Cablecom has a plan to gradually eliminate most stations and move them to digital only.... Lack of competition is really a sad thing sometimes...

			I do not really need DVB-T as Cablecom scrambles the signal. But the analogue only devices are mostly old, over two year old technology... that is why the reviews are so bad.

			Has anyone else noticed these new offers from Sunrise? I must say at first glance they look quite interesting.   
As always the devil is in the detail, and these things have to be picked apart to see where the surprises are.   
We seem to have 4 offers to examine here, and all have in common the fact that for calls to Swiss land lines and other Sunrise phones that the calls are billed by the hour, rather than the minute.   
FINE PRINT: Calls of up to 5 seconds are billed at 5rp, but calls between 5-60sec are billed exactly the same as if they were over 60 seconds - in other words the flat rate. If you often make calls under 60 seconds then you will be worse off under this plan.   
Of course if you mostly call land lines and other sunrise mobiles then these offers are very interesting, especially if you love to talk for ages. Even if you call Swisscom mobiles these are billed by the second and the per minute rates.   
Anyway, onto the four plans:       
0.49/hour(or min), monthly charge: None       
0.59/hour(or min), monthly charge: None       
0.49/hour(or min), monthly charge: 15       
0.39/hour(or min), monthly charge: 25 
Bonus: Capped at 39 francs - FINE PRINT: *ONLY* for calls to fixnet and sunrise calls, and not counting the 25 francs. International calls and calls to other mobile numbers are not counted!   
Now is it just me or is there something strange here?    
For example, Just would would the advantage be to choosing libero over pronto? The rate is higher with libero and the monthly charge is the same. Or what about comparing pronto with basic - same rate but basic costs 15 francs more (compared to 0).    
So what gives? Are sunrise effectively charging the post paid people 15 francs per month more because they will get an itemised bill? Well that isn't unreasonable - with pre-pay there is no bill, so it is only fair that should work out cheaper - it's just that it never has been up to now!   
The way I see it - I'm going to switch to the pronto plan and go to pre-pay! Unless of course there are really great deals on new handsets that save me more than the cost of the contract over 12 months, but that's another story and I still have to check that part out.   
So now let's look at the ""super"" plan and compare it to pronto. You get 0.10 francs per hour(min) less but it costs you 25 francs per month   
So that means you'd have to make more than 250 hours or minutes in a month to make it more attractive. Another bonus is the cap at 39 francs, so actually you'd have to do more than 100 hours or minutes before it became worthwhile.   
In the old plan 100 minutes would be a border that a few people would cross. But what about if your calls to fixnet and sunrise are now measured in hours instead of minutes. Now all of a sudden we are looking at 100 *calls* per month, not minutes.    
That kind of changes things, and I doubt that many people would be ahead on the super plan.   
The exception of course is if your mobile bill involves a lot of international calls or long calls to swisscom mobiles, then it would merit more examination.   
But the way I see it - most existing sunrise consumers will find that the pre-pay pronto offer is best for them.   
Anyone else with any views on this? Did I miss anything?

			I have Sunrise too but it has only happened to me a couple of times. Friends of mine that have Swisscom or Orange seem to have that problem a lot more often.   
At any rate, it's irritating and a damn nuisance. Even if it only happens now and then. And of course, if it happens to you a lot, then it just @#§° HELL!!!

absolutely right... at least that is what the telephone companies want you to believe - that you are left with 13 months and 30 days but it is questionable legally. Point been that here there is a ""fine"" for terminating the contract before the minimum period is over and this part along with the legality of renewing a contract indefinitely in the way they do ie all terms apply as if the contract was newly signed(inc min period) was what we wanted to challenge but they did not want in the original above.

			....if you're intent on having a dish up for this then monoblock is an excellent solution.  If you're a bit of a hacker (and it seems you're NOT!  ) then you could dig into CAMs and the like; failing that, plug your address into the Cablecom page and you'll find out if they serve you and what services you can get:      - top-right IIRC switches to English   
As Richard said, their base-package is available with 50-60 channels of varying quality; for Premiership you might want to see about the digital offerings or Premier   
And Billag is available in French, German and Italian.  It did used to also be in English.  Call their hotline and you will be able to speak to someone who speaks English....0844 834 834.
