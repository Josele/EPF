			After much debate an excellent idea by Treverus was to create a social group for the 'Practice Writing German thread'   
it can be found here for any that want to be involved       
Mods will check in from time to time but as with the other social groups they are pretty much left up to the participants to maintain. So play nicely   
If anyone wants to set a similar group up for French, Italian or Romanisch then you are free to do so, just let us know so we can create a sticky for it also

			Welcome to the Language Corner. Please take a moment to review these guidelines before you post.       
Switzerland has three main official languages (German, French, Italian). To make it easier for people to select the threads that interest them please prefix your subject line with the name of the language. For example:         
In some cases no prefix is necessary, for example:       
As always - try to make your subject line as relevant and as informative as possible.     
Discussions here should be limited to the use of language as it applies to life in Switzerland. This could include the use of English (see next section), but should not incude other languages (e.g. Spanish, Japanese) unless they are relevant to a topic in discussion (such as highlighting the difference between German and Japense, or the similarities between Italian and Spanish).        
This forum may be called ""English Forum"", but the focus is for English-speaking people living in Switzerland. This area  . Posts from non-natives (especially outside Switzerland) looking for help with their English  . There are other forums on the internet that deal with the English language, please use these instead (hint: google).   
From time to time there may be coverage about the English language but this will only be in the following cases:   
Please take note of the following linguistic terms that are frequently spelled incorrectly by native English speakers (since they will be used often in this area):     , not grammer.   , not pronounciation. Pronounce contains an   after the first  , pronunciation does not.

			I took the exam without much preparation other than doing a couple of practice exams. I found the use of English parts easy, I practiced those parts that I struggled with most. The oral part was not difficult either, in preparation I watched some videos and looked at the examiner notes on those exams, which are all available online as examples. This really helped, as I knew what was expected. The essay was not hard, but you need to know how to write different types of essays, letters, etc, once you have the structure right, the rest is easy. There was one part in the reading that I found tricky, where you had to put text pieces into the right order. The text made sense to me in a few different ways. The other part I found rather difficult was the 2nd part of the listening exam, where you had a variety of of muliple choice answers. I kind of guessed at some of those answers, but since I aced the other part of the listening exam, it didn't matter so much. I ended up passing with an A Grade.

			Hi, Gaetano, 
Great.  Based on my experience, it does help to have English as a buffer language (at least for me to learn Italian).  Let me know the times you are available and we can see how far we go.  For now, I'm just recovering from a severe cold and should be practically ok next week.

			Have you already checked the prices for private German lessons? If not, you will see that you usually have to pay between 90 and 130 chf for 50 or 60 minutes. Everything under 50 chf  is not acceptable for teachers who have to live from that. So I would suggest that you think again or rather look for online lessons.

			I'm taking an A2 intensive class there. I don't find the teacher to be particularly good, but she's comparable to a teacher I had at Migros Klubschule. My course is relatively small: 6 or 7 people.    
I think it's good value since it is inexpensive.

			Hi, thank you User9! A good answer is never too late  .  
I had to postpone my language course, just stuff happening, you know ...   
I must say I checked some of the small print in HBS and I didn't like some of their terms&conditions. For example once you pay for a certain course, you basically can't change your mind, postpone learning or get a refund. Not even if you get injured or seriously sick. I see they have made some changes to web pages, so the terms might have changed as well, but at that time they were pretty clear about that. I can understand their position, saying no to one student, because the class is filled up and then people just falling out. But still, it seems kind of unfair. And as you have said in a school that size if you just don't get along with a teacher or a group, you are basically stuck.   
So basically I'm back to Migros or Billingua, I hope new starting dates will come soon

			Looking for videos and games with Swiss German speak most often turns into being high German.   
Watching Peppa Pig (in High German) and many other videos, the kids love it. I found songs and stories in video, but just a static picture - doesn't really fit the purpose.   
Not trying to have the kids entirely fluent before we move from HK to CH, but want to give them a little exposure to it beforehand to ease the transition.   
Next time in CH I plan to go to local stores and see what I can find in DVDs and games, but we are looking at anything useful, whether iPad games, youtube videos or other content. Fun and entertaining is essential, so the focus is on play rather than learning.

			Hi, all. I was asking about the Goethe Zertifikat preparation courses in ZHAW but just found out that their course is already full.

Anyone has experience there? Thanks in advance!!!

Hi, all. I would like to hear from anyone who has experience or heard of german courses at ZHAW.    
I am planning to take Goethe C1 test in January in ZHAW & also found a preparation course there. If anyone has taken their courses or knows acquaintance who did it, I would like to hear about it.    
My friend who took another form of german test recommends a preparation course at the place where the test takes place. I wonder if that really has benefits since the test is already set from the wherever the Goethe main office is.    
Thanks in advance!!!

			Hi, 
   I just wanted to come back to this to share what I've learned.    
You get up to Fr. 5000 to spend on different courses but only with certain approved education institutions. The Fr. 5000 doesn't have to be spent on one course, you can re-apply multiple times until you reach the 5000 limit.    
You can also claim up to Fr. 2300 for loss of earnings where attendence of the course has meant you have had to take time off work.   
While I have mentioned a specific vendor applying for this training above I am sure that there are multiple different ones and please don't take my earlier posts of an endorsement of them.The specific term for this monetary grant that I have come acroos is ""The collective bargaining agreement for temporary staff training"".   
With the vendor I used I had to fill out an online form which included my personal details, AHV number, nationality, residence permit along with other information.   
I have attached a scan copy of a leaflet which I was provided which explains the process in a flow chart (mods please let me know if this counts as advertising and if so I will remove it).   
I was informed the application process to seek approval could take between 2-4 weeks.         
Thanks,

			io = I (1st person singular)   
tu = you (2nd person singular)   
lui = he (3rd person plural, for men)   
lei = she (3rd person singular, for women)   
Lei (always capitalized) = you  Used to address a person in a formal situation, regardless of their gender. It corresponds to the English pronoun you (2nd person singular), but it is a third-person singular pronoun in Italian. Example: lui è = he is, lei è = she is, Lei è = you are (formal). There's no plural form of Lei, i.e. it is not possible to address a group of people formally in Italian.   
noi = we (1st person plural)   
voi = you (2nd person plural)  Used to address a group of people, regardless of whether you know them or not. Previously also used as a synonym for Lei, but not anymore (except for the elderly, especially in the South).   
loro = they (3rd person plural)

			Hi there.  Having gone through this process of online tests years ago, my personal recommendation would be to go to the   end of what the tests indicate.     
I studied a bit at home before starting German classes, and got placed into too high a class.  I could not speak much, could not follow the class, had different vocabulary etc.  I gave up.  So when I came to Switzerland I deliberately started from the very beginning.  Then when I was comfortable with how the classes functioned, and my prior learning started to help, it was easy to leap a month and catch up with my ""true"" level.     
I cannot help with child care, but Migrosklubschule may have something.  I have been with them most of the way and they are flexible and responsive and I have loved the classes.  Good luck!

			After reading many texts in English I can usually spot non-native written text. It is not just about spelling or grammar, but about style. But even then I cannot write in such a style myself.   
So, if you cannot afford a professional copywriter, then my advice is: google each sentence or pieces of it, find similar sentences, and copy them without changing much.

			My mothers Spanish girl-friend went to the Migros Courses for Swiss-German and she was much better integrated in the village community afterwards. If you only need to talk the language here for private life such as finding friends, shopping ecc. I would advise Swiss-German and not High German classes because Swiss are not so fond of the Germans... at least concerning the one's with a to direct attitude...      
There was a thread how to find Swiss friends, well that is one of the ways to do it: go to Swiss-German classes... :-)

			I spent four weeks at the Goethe Institute in Munich, doing the Super Intensive course (twice):     
They do several variants, but this was the most 'full on'. The teaching was great, the accommodation not too bad (think university halls of residence but with on-suite, at a reasonable price) and the overall experience was really good.   
I thought it was possibly too much after 4 weeks, but 2 was fine!

Writing more complex texts in German is easier when you have an extensive vocabulary, but every grammatical rule that you somehow failed to integrate into the so complex mechanism of actually thinking in a foreign language is so evident (and embarrassing, depending on the circumstances).  
One thing is sure - learning German it's a lifetime process.

			Hello, 
I am looking for a German language teacher to give me private lessons. The lessons would be weekly, for one hour over lunchtime, at my office in Zollikerberg. 
I am quite fluent in German and use it to talk with my colleagues at work over lunchtime, in the corridoor, etc. However I in English and write my emails in English when I am dealing with job/business related issues as it is quicker and I don't make mistakes.  
I need to improve by grammar (der, die, das...) and my German in the context of business. My objective is ultimately to do everything in German at work: write emails, deliver presentations... 
I have seen the rates of language schools in Zurich and I find them excessive so am looking for more competitive pricing. 
Does anyone have someone they can recommend?

			I think they're interchangeable unless in the details of dental surgeries and such.    
I can't think what I 'usually' say, so I suspect there isn't one and that I use 'brush', 'clean' and 'do' interchangeably. Of course, when it comes to the toddler it's more like 'wrestle into submission'.

			I am Chinese native speaker, graduated from ETH Zurich in 2011, and started working as consultant at Fortune 500 since then. And I am currently running a small start-up on Sino-Swiss advisory, commuting between Zurich and China 3-4 times a year.    
For work and living, I wanted to improve my German language skill. My level is around A2-B1. I wanted to find a tandem (a native German speaker) for the exchange. The best is to meet up for practice. Or otherwise, we can do skype video conf. call, that is also fine for me.    
For those who are interested, kindly send me an email at: j.yan.sally AT gmail.com    
Looking forward to hearing from you!    
Cheers,    
Sally   
Forgot to mention, I am living in Zurich, btw.

			I am just coming to the end of the semi-intensive A1.1 course at Flying Teachers and thought it was quite good. I had next to no German before starting and can now hold basic conversations, which is exactly what the course prescribed. The only thing I really didn't like about it was the length of the classes - they're 2.5 hours long, which was a little tough after a full day of work and then commute from Basel to Zurich. I think I would have gotten a lot more out of them if the course had been conducted over a slightly longer period with, say, 1 or 1.5 hour classes (like the Migros Clubschule lessons for example).      
I think if you don't have to go from work then this wouldn't be a problem but I will be using a different school for A1.2 just for the shorter lessons.

94	16.05.2016, 14:05	Member	Thanked 57 Times in 40 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Nonsense.   
The OP was awarded 90% for speaking ability at B1 level, which means their grammar is pretty solid. It's inconceivable that the written part was so bad that they didn't get a single point. Even if German writing is relatively poor, someone regarded as highly competent for speaking will know enough about vocabulary, word order and grammar to muddle through with a low-scoring pass.   
There's clearly another explanation. If this isn't simply an admin error, the suggestion about not using the correct answer sheet sounds fairly plausible to me.

That might explain why I get asked this even though the timetable sign outside the bus says bus 7, there's a 7 on the outside of the bus and route 7 written on the route info display on the inside of the bus.     
I also find it funny when people ask me something in terrible German and I respond in English and then they later complain to their friend why does everyone talk back to me in English?  :-)  These days I continue in german, as one should :-)   
Flirting with the waitress/waiter (there's nothing wrong with that) in cafes can be fun.  Asking them about their weekend etc.  Generally they won't be able or willing to speak English.

			I can highly recommend italki - you pay through the website and have lessons over video on Skype.   
I have been having private lessons with two teachers (both from Germany, both with Masters degrees in German) over the past 6 months and they have both been great.   
The other thing I like about the website is in addition to having teachers, they also have regular people who speak the language (as native speakers) offering sessions for a lower price, which I've found really helpful to practice everyday conversation.

			Hello,     
I will be moving to Brazil few months from now and wanted to learn Portuguese as much as possible before doing so. I have never learned Portuguese in the past. I am, however, fluent in Spanish which might help a bit... I hope... 
French is my mother tongue (I am French) and English is close second. I would be happy to help in any of these 2 languages. I live in Luzern, work in Zug and go frequently to Zurich. I would, therefore, be open to practice within any of these cities. 
Please message me if interested

			To second (third?) other comments:   
Often the admin's job is to fill in where an executive lacks local language skills.   
For instance, in an officially English speaking company you may find that top management and highly skilled employees are often recruited from the anglosphere. As these key people likely do not have German, French, Italian, etc. it becomes even more important that the admins are fluent, written and spoken, in the local and frequently used languages. Often native level fluency is a basic requirement of the job even in company where English is the official language used.   
Obviously YMMV, but if you are set on a career in admin, set your language goals realistically.   
Good luck!

			I discovered this recently and thought it's worth sharing: Hiking (or just strolling around the village) around Braunwald leads you through countless book exchange shelves full of, you know, the usual stuff that tends to reside on shelves like that (crime novels etc, but the occasional serendipitous find that is truly awesome). 99% of it is in German which is why I put this thread in the language corner.   
You're supposed to bring a book if you take one (a non-enforced rule but makes sense). Perfect if you're, for example, hesitant to buy stuff that might prove too difficult for your language skills; just bring it back and try again...   
...and oh yes I know there's libraries closer to where people tend to live. But this one gives you a reason to hike too - and you'll be reading a different book on the train back!

			Thanks for the reply.   
When I discussed with the teacher and told her I only want to go to B1+, but they put me in B1, according to them, the test I performed is not good. Though I learnt good Grammar in Goethe Institute, while it existed a bit of Grammar I haven't experienced in their test(10 page test, only grammar focused). The school strongly emphasize they are STRICT, that's why they can't accept my request to put me in B1+, though the B1+ is more for brushing up learnt key points and writing, and I have passed my B1 test. And B1+ is not a new level like B2. In a word, there is no negotiation with this school. They agree that I can redo the test, but I may have a second thought.

123	07.04.2016, 07:34	Member	Thanked 31 Times in 25 Posts	Location: Canada // Switzerland	"    All germanic languages have a kind of infinitive particle: 
DE: zu 
EN: to 
DK: at 
NO: å 
NL: te 
etc.   
But each language describe this differently: 
English:   is part of the infinitive form as such. 
German:   is not part of the infinitive as the ending -en (-ern/-eln) is enough to note the infinitive form as opposed to conjugated forms. This   is only one way to link two verbs in the same clause.   
This means that you just have to learn the rules when   pups up and when not in German and stop comparing.

I am trying to decide a German language school to enroll(intensive course) and I narrowed it down to Infront Sprachstudio and Sprachwelten in Zurich, does anyone have any experiences to share about these two schools?

			Very difficult as the text itself seems to contain severe inconsistencies, and that's not even counting the difficulty of it being phonetically written:   
This is on New Year, the general theme is ""New Year brings new luck"". However ""lick"", ""klick"" and ""glick"" all stand for the same ""glick"", probably even ""lek"", i.e. the german Glück;  (""En lek diss onklick weit serick              "" => ""Ein Glück dass dieses Unglück weit zurück [liegt]"").   
Same goes for ""neis"", ""neiens"" and ""neies"", all are forms of ""neues"".   
It would probably help a lot to hear it loud, spoken by an german-native from nova scotia.

Well, then I am old fashioned, because I use the adress ""Werte/r"" all the time, for me it is the perfect middle way neither being too formal and not yet too cordial, especially when you are not (yet) on first name terms with someone.   
And for a condolence/birthday or some such card I feel it is a good way to address someone.   
Also, in the end, it is the thought that counts, as I have experienced personally on a couple of sad events in my family. It is indeed  very consoling, when someone takes the time to think of you in this way, when you go through hell!

I'm planning on taking the C2-Proficiency test in English this summer, thus I'm looking for preferably native English speakers who'd like to make conversation :-)   
I'm from Zurich and I can offer different things as an exchange if you're interested, like language teaching ((Swiss-)German, French), support for job-applications/ housing and stuff like that. Everything where you need German language or knowledge of a local person :-)   
Looking forward to meeting you.

			Looks like a new school as that building has not been there very long (year or two). Impossible to glean much from the website as it's very light on detail and has no information on who exactly is teaching.   
I note there's an open evening on Wednesday 6 January so your best bet is probably to go along and get a feel for the place.   
As for cost, it's not cheap, but then very few language courses here are.

Hello   
I really enjoyed my clases. I achieved a2.2 after 5 months study. I felt encouraged to speak and use my German in each class. The teacher was really great and they allowed for us to have free tine to speak in German about things we were interested in such as current events, our culture/homeland etc. The course was only 2 hours a day with daily homework in an activity book. If you are wanting to learn faster do an all day course otherwise this is a good place to start from the beginning and ease your way into learning German.

At one end you have Spain, where J is pretty much exactly as the ch in German  . On the other end, people from countries close to the Caribbean (such as Cuba, Puerto Rico and Venezuela) do pronounce it as an H; in fact this is a quick way to distinguish someone from those latitudes, and also a quick way to mock them.    
Chile is at neither end, but I would say we pronounce J more like in Spain than like in Cuba.

			Hi, I am looking for a beginner's Swiss German course with childcare in Zurich. I have enquired with my Gemeinde in Opfikon but it currently does not have availability. The timing on AOZ's courses does not work for me.    
I came across this website and wonder if anyone have any thoughts on how good they are:     
If anyone knows of any other good german courses with childcare, please let me know!

			Having wasted a lot of money on Benedict schule, and then finding a hidden gem - Sprachwelten - I would highly recommend the latter to everyone! 
At Sprachwelten, we had a very small group of 4 students, so there was a lot of personal attention and a lot of opportunity to speak - something that big schools with 20 people in one class don't have. I wish I had found it sooner - I would certainly have found it a lot easier to absorb the basic grammar.

Unfortunately I have realized that the private lessons on SKYPE  would be the best option due to the lack of my mobility. 
Can you be so kind as to recommend any private teachers so that I can learn basic stuff ?

			The first exam that I took was a B2 where I scored 95%. My reading and writing is fine but a five year old can probably besser als mich auf Deutsch reden. I try watching TV in German to absorb more of the language and after not very long I either get a headache or my mind wanders. I manage a bit better with subtitles switched on.

			Hi there    
Another option could be to have conversation lessons or practice your German language skills with someone online. You can have one on one lessons for really cheap with a native German  speaker in Germany. They are much cheaper and really helpful.

			Hi Jenn, 
I don't know 2 weeks intensive course. Usually 1 level takes 2 months. It's the shortest. 
If you are looking for more convenient course, you can go to Germany (Loerrach, Rheinfelden, Weil am Rhein). It's 20 min from Basel but prices are not so high both in private schools and VHS (schools for adults, where they also have intensive courses). 
You can also look for private lessons. Price in germany around 30 chf/45 min.

			Hi all,   
My girlfriend, though, is Bernese, and I am going to go visit her for the entire month of December (or from 03/12/15 to 05/01/16 specifically).    
I would like to use my month there wisely and   learning German, because I am fairly certain that I am going to relocate there sometime in the next year (and I will spend the first half of next year learning it in the USA as well).    
I was wondering if anyone could give me some recommendations; I know zero German, though I am using Memrise to start learning some basics.    
Thankfully having a swiss gf is helpful because she found a list of all the German school in Bern on the canton website (though it, ironically, is all in German), so I at least ""know"" my options.   
My problems, though, are    
1. I do not know how to seriously discriminate between the 15 or so that are listed.    
2. this month long period is an awkward amount of times because it is quite short and because of Christmas holidays; many school end their courses in the middle of December; not so convenient for me.    
3. When one knows little/no German, is it better to go to klubschule migros, for example, and have a group lesson that is cheaper, or to pay more money for a 1v1 session and potentially move through the basics much more quickly?   
4. My desire to do this was conceived recently and thus gives little time for preparation.    
Thanks for your input and I apologize for the length of this query.

			Ha ! :-)  
This original post made me chuckle, reminding me that when I first arrived in CH (from a big city), during my first startled supermarket visits, with feeble German skills, I was subjected multiple and seemingly infinite parting salutations at the supermarket check out (just when I thought I'd made it out alive, she'd say yet another thing for me to decypher). At first it literally had me turning back to face the Verkauferin, asking ""wie bitte"", as she inevitably said just one more thing:      all in Swiss German of course 
...I have since become used to the embracing politeness of Dorf life. And that a slightly slow motion goodbye is expected and polite. This isn't the impersonal big city after all. I like it, it's home.

			Just wanted to give an update. In the end I've went with Voxea and I must say I'm super happy with them. Progressed quite a bit in A2 course and teacher really put lots of effort into it, helped and explained as much as possible. The other students were great (Foreigners with different backgrounds) and they tried to get the most out of the lessons. 
If it would be cheaper, I like to continue there, but for now I'll go for online classes.

216	01.10.2015, 22:13	Banned	Thanked 37 Times in 28 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    There are certain avoidable mistakes (capitalization anywhere but with nouns/beginnings of sentences, mentioning things in CV which belong in the cover letter and vice versa, misspelling of names/job descriptions) which should definitely be done perfectly. Others aren't as important - but if one hands in a cover letter which isn't at least free of grammatical/spelling errors, there are simply too many other applicants nowadays who possibly have gone through the trouble to weed out grammatical/spelling errors and thus might get a better chance at a job. The cover letter/CV is the first and sometimes only impression one can give for a job and thus score a job interview (unless you call in advance and know how to build sentences and keep up a job-related discussion in a foreign language while under stress), so one should make as good a first impression as possible.   
I believe that an applicant has enough time to convince the future boss of their abilities/will to learn when in the job interview, why risk not even getting a chance to attend a job interview if you can avoid it by writing a very good cover letter/CV?

			Shopkeepers will often greet you in one language and switch if the customers replies in the other language.   
At our bilingual school's parent council each member that wants to contribute something will do so in either French or High German. If translation is needed then someone steps in.   
At our boys' soccer club the coaches yell their insteuctions in both French and Swiss German depending on whom they are addressing. At the parent meeting everything was said in both languages. That was one long meeting!

It would certainly suffice to say, 'It is quite thrilling' or perchance 'Most interesting'.

			Hi, I`m planning to study French via Skype with a private tutor. I`m looking for a partner so that we can split a cost.  
The course description is very intriguing and they provide a lot of feedback.    
My level is around A1-A2 so I`m not a complete beginner.   
Let me know if someone is interested.   
Thanks, 
Denis

			Hello everyone,   
I'm Laura - originally from Birmingham in the UK but I moved to Switzerland a year ago. I'm now based in Lausanne but I work in Bern. Although I speak high German (not amazingly, but I understand nearly everything and can just about manage to work in German) I really struggle with Swiss German.    
I'd be interested in meeting up with a native Swiss German speaker over a coffee and speaking half in German (and Swiss German where possible - but to start with this might be a bit of a boring conversation!!) and half in English.    
Just so you know what sort of person I am, I'm interested in films, reading, travelling, languages, cooking and meeting up with friends.    
I hope to hear from a new language buddy soon (or get some advice about where I might be able to find one!)    
Thanks everyone    
Laura

			Hi there,I have been to Bellingua but just for a short time .I found it very good for someone who really want to learn quickly and intensively. Someone who need to do the test or need to study in higher lever for work or university. Because for me as an old lady I found  with zero background in german ,it was pretty stressful and too intense but I would say the school is very good so just me thou    at the end I went to EB Zürich in Altstetten instead ,they are a bit more relax so i was not too scare&stress to go to school . ( also a bit cheaper same 3 hours from Monday to Friday for intensive course )  
I also went to Alamenia  but i think a bit too short for just for 2 hours per day. 
Just a roughly idea for you so I hope it does help.

			Actually I'm using Rosetta Stone the version they sell to corporate clients (not sure if it's the same) and they do have translation for everything as well as all verbs declination. Also, they have different set of topics/industries depending what you want to focus on. good option specially if combined with some regular classes, eithe f2f or skype.

			[QUOTE=JagWaugh;2442253]Ilona, for you, stop reading English NOW, only read German. Magazines, Newspapers, books. Try now to start translating your own professional stuff into German. Try to establish some contacts in the field you are planning on working in and ask them to send you some representative texts so you can get an idea of the level and style commonly used. The higher the level you read at the better your vocabulary is, and reading literature from the field will help you get to grips with the terminology.

many language schools offer Conversational lessons.   
The best ones seem to be: 
Bellingua  
Flying Teachers  
LernZentrum Turner    
Further, there are various meet-up groups that offer free conversation in High or Swiss German. 
Sign up to

			There are always emails that we go through together. Often times he calls me to look at his emails. I normally look at the ones that are relevant to me. I have never gone through his emails.  
The one I am curious about is so outstanding. It is the emails that people send to each other for 30 times back and forth. Anyone notices it at the first glance. I asked him the same questions I posted here but I was not satisfied with the answer. We have been together for 18 years. This is the first time that I saw such thing.

			...  I had come across the Swiss German version years ago and thought it was  hilarious.   But until about an hour ago I didn't know that there were  other, country  and language specific,  versions of it out there ....

Life in the Australian Army....   
Text of a letter from a kid from Eromanga to Mum and Dad. (For Those of    you not in the know, Eromanga is a small town, west of Quilpie in the    far south west of Queensland )   
Dear Mum & Dad,   
I am well. Hope youse are too. Tell me big brothers Doug and Phil that    the Army is better than workin' on the station - tell them to get in    bloody quick smart before the jobs are all gone! I wuz a bit slow in    settling down at first, because ya don't hafta get outta bed until 6am.    But I like sleeping in now, cuz all ya gotta do before brekky is make   ya  bed and shine ya boots and clean ya uniform. No bloody horses to  get   in, no calves to feed, no troughs to clean - nothin'!! Ya haz  gotta   shower though, but its not so bad, coz there's lotsa hot water  and even a   light to see what ya doing! 
At brekky ya get cereal, fruit and eggs but there's no kangaroo steaks    or goanna stew like wot Mum makes. You don't get fed again until noon    and by that time all the city boys are buggered because we've been on a    'route march' - geez its only just like walking to the windmill in  the   bullock paddock!! 
This one will kill me brothers Doug and Phil with laughter. I keep    getting medals for shootin' - dunno why. The bullseye is as big as a    bloody dingo's arse and it don't move and it's not firing back at ya    like the Johnsons did when our big scrubber bull got into their prize    cows before the Ekka last year! All ya gotta do is make yourself    comfortable and hit the target - it's a piece of piss!! You don't even    load your own cartridges, they comes in little boxes, and ya don't have    to steady yourself against the rollbar of the roo shooting truck when    you reload! 
Sometimes ya gotta wrestle with the city boys and I gotta be real    careful coz they break easy - it's not like fighting with Doug and Phil    and Jack and Boori and Steve and Muzza all at once like we do at home    after the muster. 
Turns out I'm not a bad boxer either and it looks like I'm the best the    platoon's got, and I've only been beaten by this one bloke from the    Engineers - he's 6 foot 5 and 15 stone and three pick handles across the    shoulders and as ya know I'm only 5 foot 7 and eight stone wringin'    wet, but I fought him till the other blokes carried me off to the    boozer.   
I can't complain about the Army - tell the boys to get in quick before word gets around how bloody good it is.   
Your loving daughter,   
Susan   
--------------------------------------------------------------------   :    Dear Ma and Pa:    
   I am well. Hope yall are too. Tell Brother Walt and Brother Elmer     the Marine Corps is easy and beats working for old man Minch by a     country mile. They really ought to join up quick before all the places     are filled. 
    I was restless at first because they make you stay in bed till     nearly 5:00 a.m., but I am getting so I like to sleepin in late. Tell     Walt and Elmer all you has to do before breakfast is smooth your cot  and    shine your boots and buckles. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch,  mash to    mix, wood to split, hay to lay practically nothing. Men gots  to  shave   but it is not so bad, theyve even got warm water. 
    Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs,     bacon, etc., but kind of weak on the pork chops, fried potatoes, salt     cured ham, steak, sausage, gravy and biscuits and other regular     breakfast foods, but tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by some city     boys that live on coffee and doughnuts. Their food plus yours holds    you  till noon when you get fed again. Its no wonder these city boys    cant  walk far. 
    Speakin of walkin; we go on route marches which the Platoon     Sergeant says are long walks to toughen us up. If he thinks so, its not     my place to tell him different. A route march is about as far as  to    our mailbox at home. The countryside is nice but awfully flat. We   dont   climb hills or nothin. Them city guys get sore feet and we all   get to   ride back in trucks. The Sergeant is like a school teacher. He   nags us a   lot. The Captain is like the school board. Majors and   Colonels just   ride around and frown. They dont bother you none. 
    This next part will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing. I keep     getting medals for shooting! I dont know why. The bulls-eye is purt-ear     as big as a chipmunks head and it dont move, and it aint shooting     back at you like the Higgett boys do at home. All you got to do is  lie    there all comfortable and hit it. You dont even load your own     cartridges. They come in boxes. 
    Then we have what they call hand-to-hand combat training. You get     to wrestle with them city boys. I have to be real careful though, they     break real easy. It aint like fighting with that ole bull at home.  Im    about the best they got in this except for that guy Jordan from  over  in   Silver Lake. I only beat him once. He joined up the same time  as  me,  but  Im only 56″ and 130 pounds, and hes 68″ and weighs  near  300  pounds  dry. 
    Be sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers get onto this setup and come stampeding in.  
 Your loving daughter, 
 Gail

Brief eines Bundeswehrrekruten an die Eltern:   
Liebe Mutter, lieber Vater, 
mir gehts gut. Ich hoffe, Euch, Annemarie, Klaus, Karl, Willi, Sigrid,    Peter und Hans auch. Sagt Karl und Willi, dass Beim-Heer-sein jede    Landarbeit um Längen schlägt. Sie sollen sich schnell verpflichten,    bevor alle Plätze voll sind. 
Zuerst war ich sehr unruhig, weil man bis fast bis um 6 Uhr im Bett    bleiben muss, aber nun gefällt mir das mit dem Lange-Ausschlafen. Sagt    Karl und Willi, man muss nur sein Bett richten und ein paar Sachen vor    dem Frühstück polieren. 
Keine Tiere füttern, kein Feuer machen, keinen Stall sauber machen oder    Holz hacken... praktisch gar nichts. Die Männer müssen sich rasieren,    aber das ist nicht so schlimm, es gibt nämlich warmes Wasser. 
Das Frühstück ist ein bisschen komisch, mit jeder Menge Saft, Getreide,    Eier, aber dafür fehlt völlig Kartoffeln, Schinken, Steaks und das    andere normale Zeug, aber sagt Karl und Willi, man kann immer neben    irgendwelchen Städtern sitzen, die nur Kaffee trinken und das Essen von    denen mit deinem eigenen hält dann bis zum Mittag, wenn es wieder was    zuessen gibt. 
Es wundert mich nicht, dass die Jungs aus der Stadt nicht weit laufen können. 
Wir gehen viel auf ""Überlandmärsche"", von denen der Vizeleutnant sagt,    dass langes Laufen gut ist für die Abhärtung. Naja, wenn er das glaubt,    als Rekrut kann ich da nichts dagegen sagen. 
Ein ""Überlandmarsch"" ist ungefähr so weit wie bei uns zum Postamt, aber    wenn wir da sind, haben die Städter wunde Füße und wir fahren alle in    LKWs zurück. 
Die Landschaft hier im Burgenland ist schön, aber fast ganz flach. Der    Vizeleutnant ist wie unser Lehrer. Er nörgelt immer. Der Hauptmann ist    wie der Bürgermeister. 
Majore und Oberste fahren viel in Autos und gucken komisch, aber sie lassen einen völlig in Ruhe. 
Und jetzt das Beste. Das wird Karl und Willi umbringen vor Lachen: 
Ich kriege Auszeichnungen für`s Schießen! Ich weiß nicht warum. Das    Schwarze ist viel größer als ein Rattenkopf und bewegt sich nicht mal    und es schießt auch nicht zurück, wie die Laubrunner Brüder mit dem    Luftgewehr. 
Alles was du machen musst ist, dich bequem hinlegen und es treffen. 
Man muss nicht mal seine eigenen Patronen machen. Sie haben sie schon fertig in Kisten. 
Dann gibt's noch ""Nahkampfausbildung"". Du kannst mit den Städtern    ringen. Aber ich muss sehr vorsichtig sein, die gehen leicht kaputt. 
Ist viel leichter als den Stier zu bändigen. Ich bin am besten darin,    außer gegen den Voller Sepp, der hat genau am gleichen Tag angefangen    wie ich, aber ich hab nur einmal gegen ihn gewonnen. 
Das wird daran liegen, dass ich mit meinen 65 Kilo nur 1,70 m bin und er mit seinen 2 Metern und 120 Kilos ist halt schwieriger. 
Vergesst nicht Karl und Willi schnell Bescheid zu sagen, bevor andere mitkriegen, wie das hier läuft und uns die Bude einrennen. 
Alles Liebe, 
Eure Tochter Maria

			Hi, I just arrived here in Basel, as a visiting PhD student. I am looking for someone who is interested in Chinese language and culture. As return, you can share your ideas about Switzerland or Germany, and help to improve my German ability.   
I've spent one year in Germany, but for an English program, so my German is just not good (B1). Now I want to improve it. If you feel interested, please contact me (yliueagle@googlemail.com)   
Looking forward~

			I'm trying very hard to learn Swiss German, but currently what I speak sounds more like bad Hochdeutsch with a Swiss accent and some Swiss words thrown in and some lapses back to Norwegian when I get out of my comfort zone grammar and vocabulary wise.   
I remember when I moved to Norway in the late 90s. Foreigners were easily identified by their lack of dialect as they learned ""normative"" Norwegian at ""immigrant school"". Didn't really help integration. I learned Norwegian while living in a Norwegian family and going to school and thus went right to the local dialect. It really helped me ""blend in"" and feel at home where I lived, and even if people could hear that I was a foreignerm they usually commented positively on my use of dialect. Now mostly people from the place where I picked up my dialect can hear that I'm not from there, and even they don't alway get that I'm a foreigner.    
In an ideal world, I would both speak and write Hochdeutsch and speak Swiss German fluently. For now, my immediate goal is to speak passable Swiss German, write understandable High German and understand both more or less fluently.

I have completed German A1 level with Goethe Institute. Currently, I am looking for super intensive class for A2 and then B1 level. Ideally, I would like to study from Monday - Friday, 3-4 hours/session.  
I base in St. Moritz where there are not much option for language school.  
If language school is not an option, I am open to group tutor as well.    
Thanks in advance for your advise.    
Best Regards,

			Hi there!   
Thanks for answering! I actually started A2 course in migros and did already 2/3 of A2 level. It would be great to join when  you guys get there! I had two teachers in migros klubschule and I liked  them both. However, I didn't like the teachers who came for replacement when our teachers went for holidays. 
Anyways, it was more about the people in the office - they were very  rude. During level A1 my class was quite big, but people started to  quit. In the middle of A2 there was only few of us left and finally they  decided not to prolong the course. Maybe after holidays I will take a  look again at klubschule and join last part of A2 if I don't find  anything else...   
Thanks again and take care!

My dearest one costs me £18 an hour,  both tutors I have are really easy to talk to and the time flies!  My mistakes aren't pointed out whilst I am speaking so train of thought isn't lost and the mistakes are added to the chat bit so you can see later on where you went wrong.  You can choose what you want to talk about or what grammar points you need help with.  I think this works out better than a class situation.

Stick with it... after a certain point it becomes a lot easier, and you don't even notice that you're reading German. When I arrived here I just stopped reading English for the first 3 years... after about 8months to a year I rarely if ever needed the dictionary.

			I've finally finished editing the audio and text for the 1961 film 'Frau Holle' (see the share link in the top post of this thread).   
The audio is 31 mins of continuous dialogue (no gaps longer than 1 second). 
The folder also contains a document with all dialogues. 
Note: i did not translate the German to English, I downloaded the subtitles direct from    
In addition, I've discovered an excellent lyrics plugin for Foobar 2000 called [Lyric Show Panel 3] which shows the words as you listen, see demo video here which has sound:   
Each MP3 contains the actual dialogues, and because I've setup timings for each line, Foobar automatically shows the words in karaoke style.

			Did you mention where you'll be moving to? I've forgotten it if you did. Sounds like you'll do fine picking up on German with your experiences with other languages and your determination. But do I understand you correctly that you are planning on resuming nursing studies? Did you begin and have to leave off? Or do you have a degree and are adding to that? If you'll be studying then your location will make a big difference.

			While High German may be considered a standardized language, word usage can vary by region. For some fun, you might wish to look at ""Atlas zur deutschen Alltagssprache"".    
For example, the German word for dialect can be Mundart, Dialekt or Platt:

			High German (better: Standardsprache, Standarddeutsch) is an artificial language for all German speakers. It was put together of all the dialects spoken to create a written language common to the German speakers of Belgien, Elsass, Luxemburg, Liechtenstein, Südtirol, Lothringen, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. High German allows many local variants. It is like britified, aussified, scottified, eirefied and 'mericafied English as the thread opener so aptly put it :-)    
So die Butter and der Butter are both correct as der Tunnel and das Tunnel, Finken and Pantoffeln, Patschen and Hausschuhe are all perfectly good Standardsprache and can be used by any German speaker if he likes it. But Finken will be used mainly by the Swiss, Patschen by the Austrians, Hausschuhe and Pantoffeln mostly by the Germans. Trottoir and Gehsteig and Bürgersteig are all perfectly good Standarddeutsch and so on. 
Just because a German speaker from the northern shores thinks Trottoir for Bürgersteig is weird, it is nonetheless absolutely correct. As I once tried to find Rahm in a Hildesheim Supermarket, nobody knew what I meant and I tried to explain and then they found out...oh, you mean Schlagsahne! I certainly knew the word, but I normally use the more southern German Rahm which they don't use up there and it just didn't come to my mind at that moment, it was very funny after all!  There is no lesser or better German, there are just many valid variants.    
Dialects are something else alltogether, because they are oral and only written in informal situations. Sometimes this becomes kinda quirky: My niece speaks the same dialect as my sister and I at home. But when she writes me a text- message, she writes it in the local dialect; the dialect she speaks with her friends (Bündnerland). Just love it.

			Make sure you get a translator with some cultural understanding of the target market, if your website is targeted at the German/Swiss market. Translation prices might be higher but you should invest into a native speaker with some cultural knowledge- I have seen horrendous German translations on webpages!!!

			Hi    
I've been meaning to post something about my experiences with passing the C2 exam for a while, so this is a good prompt.  My language journey is maybe a bit unusual, I brushed up an old German GCSE before I moved to Switzerland and managed to pass the B1 course before I made the move but once here I didn't have a strong desire to do a further course for about another 6 years! What prompted me to study further was a realization that when I had stagnated a bit and was making the same old mistakes.  I was also weighing up some further education (retraining as a teacher) and that also required the C2.  In the end I decided to plump for a private lesson (1.5hours per week at Sprachwelten in Zurich) and it took about 12 months before I felt ready to have a stab at the exam.  As with all language exams it's pretty formulaic so you really need to have the exam technique nailed, particularly as certain parts of the exam are pretty tight time wise.  You also really need to have the broad range of vocab and doing a course forces you to think about using alternative adjectives and phrases (rather than your stock ones).   
So what has the C2 brought me?  I think it's been a bit of a confidence boost to be honest because it was challenging and I managed to come through it.  It has also been a platform to explore new career opportunities (as I'd been working primarily in English).  Ultimately, having the goal of the exam also helped focus my learning on areas of weakness (for mewritten German and Grammar).    
Anyway best of luck if you do decide to go for it.

			Hello 😊 
My name is Anaïs and I'm 19 years old. I'm currently attending the FMS Basel and I need to make a three week exchange in an english speaking country during summer holiday. I will pay the costs for the flight and I can offer babysitting and/or tutoring (f.e. German, French...). 
Does anyone know a family who would be interested in this?  
Thanks for your help! 
Kind regards, Anaïs

			For the days I completely agree with your interpretation as this is what I would use.   
For the months however I use 'this' for months in the current year ( irrespective of if it's in the past or the future) and 'last' or 'next' for the previous or following years.   
For example I would say 'this February' for February 2015 and 'last February' for February 2014 and 'next February' for February 2016. 
The same would apply for August so 'this August' would be August 2015 and next August would be 2016.

The free online grammar checker of Duden will identify your simple errors. The only problem is that it does not give you the answers but if you have at least a basic understanding of the grammar, you can correct the errors that it pinpoints by trial and error.

""This is exciting,"" thought the gentleman. ""I've always been a big fan of the Pope. Perhaps I'll be able to see him in person.""     Suddenly, the man realized his seat was right next to the Pope himself.     Still, the gentleman was too shy to speak to the Pope.     Shortly after take-off, the Pope took a crossword puzzle out off his bag and began working on it.     This is fantastic, thought the gentleman. I'm really good at crosswords. Perhaps if the Pope gets stuck, he'll ask me for assistance.     After a while, the Pope turned to the man and said, ""Excuse me, but do you know a four letter word referring to a woman that ends in 'unt'?     The man was in shock. He could only think of one word that fit the description and he was not about to say it to the Pope. The gentleman thought for a while longer, then it hit him.      Turning to the pope, the gentleman said, ""I think you're looking for the word 'aunt'.""     ""Of course,"" said the Pope. ""Do you have an eraser?""

			I am the first to say that anecdotal, non-scientific evidence has limited value. But I have a certain amount of experience and observation and have lived in many countries, usually among Americans, and we sent all our children to local French schools at least to age 12. They all speak French, one is married to a French man. The children of the others all go to French lycées or (in 1 case) a French nursery school. I speak only French to him, others speak mostly English to him; he doesn't speak at all yet (he's not yet 2) except for a few words, arbitrarily one language or the other: un, deux, shoe, car. (FWIW all the grandchildren other than the French ones are Swiss citizens, so their parents agree that they ought to speak at least 1 Swiss language. Especially my son who went to college with a Danish guy who spoke no Danish, only German, because his German mother divorced his Danish father when he was a toddler and both Denmark and Germany bar or limit dual nationality.)   
I knew parents who sent their children to French schools and, one year later, despaired that they were learning nothing and took them out of the French system. Big mistake. Our kids started speaking French almost the first day of their second year of primary school, not before.   
Ne vous en faites pas : votre enfant sait plus que vous ne le pensez.    
There are books and books written on this. I started a thread the other day because I am interested -- out of curiosity not necessity -- in the learning of sign languages ( Swiss SL is based on the French system, as is ASL; British SL and German SL are different. Swiss German is close to Swiss French ). Anyway my point is that languages are easily learned before puberty, but not afterwards unless you have special aptitude. And while they are best learned beginning at age 0, anything before 5 is fine.    
Many years ago my daughter was in a class in Ecolint, French Section, Geneva. One of her classmates was a Down child with a high level of ability. He spoke 3 languages.    
Those are all anecdotes and should be read as such. I ask only that you take with some cynicism those who say that one should first be grounded in a single language before learning others. Whole generations of deaf children who were refused ASL because of the Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf (Milan Conference of 1880) where that view was established, were cheated: many never learned any language at all.    
Look around you in Switzerland: I had a Swiss ancestor who, on stage, told jokes in six languages. In the 1920s Iowa and Nebraska tried to make it illegal to teach a foreign language to a child. Happily the Supreme Court threw that one out: Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923); Bartels v. Iowa, 262 U.S. 404 (1923). (Gov. Ma Ferguson is reputed to have said ""If the King's English was good enough for Jesus Christ, it's good enough for the children of Texas!"" She didn't of course, but you get the point.   )   
Good luck. Hope that helps.

			Hello.   
I've been pointed by others I asked (outside this forum) to Web sites that more or less answer the question. There are 10,000 deaf signers in all of Switzerland, 5,500 using Swiss-German, 1,700 Swiss-French, 300 Swiss-Italian and the others can be presumed to be using ASL.        
But: Wikipedia says ""In 2011 it was estimated that 7,500 deaf and 13,000 hearing people use DSGS.""   
There are also hearing-capable signers, some of whom will be trained as interpreters. Wikipedia suggests they number 13,000 in all of Switzerland.   
A general study for the Council of Europe is here and is widely quoted and distributed on the Internet:     
Wikipedia's English-language page on German Sign Language says: ""It (GSL) is not related to Austrian Sign Language, which is used in parts of southern Germany, nor to Swiss Sign Language, both of which are part of the French Sign Language family, though they have had some influence from German Sign Language.""   
Thanks to anyone who gave thought to my question. For the rest I shall have to get in touch with professionals in the field. I find it interesting that Swiss-German SL is distinct from the signing used in Germany, and that even in Germany there are distinct variants.

			Does your son speak Swedish? If so, then the jump to German may not be that huge. There are some similarities between the languages. I have a friend that married a Swede and she picked up the language as an adult quite easily coming from Swiss German/German.

			To preface, I'm an adult ESL teacher with 5 years experience. At my last job especially, my school really focused on making sure students practice all their language schools and balanced listening/speaking/writing/reading. Also, we made sure the was grammar, vocab, and phonics involved in every lesson. I have high expectations.   
Here in Switzerland, it seems like they're still teaching language the mid-20th century way. Teacher talks at you for 2 hours and you do gap fills to practice grammar and study vocab out of a book.   I've tried Allemania and talking to the other students it seems that Migroschule and Flying Teachers are the same.   
Any tips greatly appreciated!

			Actually I also had a weird situation occur with flying teachers after I took their placement test. (how awkward that they have to call you with the results and cannot view them ourselves  ) 
I would suggest trying out the class or taking the test again. Did you guess on some of the answers and by chance this upped your score?

			Just nitpicking here, but at risk that the OP misinterprets EF authority on admissions to Masters Programs, I would define ""befähigt"" as to enable or prepare (if completed successfully) as opposed to entitle. The Bachelors is in this sense considered a prerequisite, nothing more.

			You simply have to remember the basic, in English the formular would be: ""Are you going to get the wireless or am I going to get the wireless"" or in Swiss accended German: ""Hol du die Radio oder hol I die Radio""

			Wow, I have been researching a lot about language schools for my Deutsch Kurse. 
Thing is, I always end up concentrating myself on knowing better EB and Migros Klub Schule.  
Both of them, I heard really good things.... 
I had a bad experience with EB, when I finally decided, they just wouldn't answer my emails properly. They said they had spot only on may. I asked them about other days course or the intensiv, I never got an answer!  
Well, in the other hand I found another one here in Uster (where I live) - the name is Audio Vis. They are in other cities as well.  
They are not the cheaper one, but they have small classes, and I went there yesterday and seems pretty nice...some people from other cities come here to they're classes and well...I think it might be better than Migros.  
It is a little bit more expenseive...but in the other hand, I don't have to pay for transportation...I can go by bike... ! And they have a summer break program...so they won't stop on march, may...    
What do you think about that? Or schould I just go to Migros Klub Schule?   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2015	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Language Schools - Audio Vis	flubber03	Posts: 67	640	0	Language corner

			Hello!   
I'm looking for a German tutor to help me with my grammar. I have a B1 level German and I am looking for a tutor in the Aarau/Lenzburg area. This person does not have to be a professional, but perhaps a University student.   
Let me know if you can think of anyone!   
Thanks!

			Hi everyone,   
I am a native Indonesian woman speaker and fluent in English. I would like to do tandem with one of you who live in Zürich continously every friday afternoon. I have basic of german until A2 level. I am good at writting but not confident enough to make a conversation. So I will be very happy if I can find someone (preferably woman) to do tandem with me. I can teach you Indonesia from the beginning.   
Please send me a personal message if you are interested.   
Regards.

			I'd say the ideal is to go to a country where they speak the language you want to learn. However it is possible to learn a language if you are surrunded daily by people who speak that language.

			Full immersion is the only way to rapidly improve your French but honestly it takes years to get to a good level unless you are super smart. I would also recommend private lessons on the side for structured learning. French is a very structured language and you need to learn about grammar in order to make decent sentences.  Bonne chance.

			Yep, I could have been clearer. So, she is French and wanting to learn/improve English. She is available from mid June to the end of August so longer than 3-4 weeks but I'm sure that's flexible...  I have no idea what a 16 year old in interested in. The Family lives in a lovely place just outside of Nice South France.    
I'm not sure of the details, like if they would do three weeks together with each family or alone, I'm just looking for a place to start.   
Thanks for all your input.

The challenge for me (and I think for lot of non-German expat speakers) is that at work you have English as accepted/official language and outside work almost everywhere you can use English as local people will be able to communicate with you. So I'm not ""exposed"" to German for day-to-day activity. I have started the high_german classes and will aim for 2/3 years to be able to have some acceptable management of the language. After will proceed to Swiss-German.

I've got 3 weeks before I start work and go on holiday which we'll be using to get settled/find a flat/etc.  Wondering if there was an intense german course for 3 weeks or so (looking to fill the gap between 18th March-10th April)   
Then in May when we're probably back in CH, take German classes in a standard course that's offered...   
I know 3 weeks isn't enough but at least it could give us a head start whilst we don't have pressures of work and help us start getting acquainted... just a thought. Look forward to the suggestions thank you

You can change the criteria if this translator doesn't offer what you need for your price. Worth a try.

			I think reading is one of the best things she can do, and Antolin is great as it gives both of you a good idea of how much she is understanding. When you enter the name of a book it tells you the grade level but I wouldn't worry about that too much. I think any reading is good reading at this stage. We used Antolin a lot when my daughter was in the 2nd class (she's now in the 4th) and it really helped to build her confidence.   
You could also try the Lük and Minilük puzzle as well ( )   
You can buy the actual puzzle device and also do it as an app, I think. There are lots of different puzzle books covering all aspects of German language as well as maths etc, and you should be able to find one specifically for the cases or that at least includes it. It can be expensive but try second-hand, too, such as Ricardo. My daughter's class also used this quite often in the 2nd class, I think, so ask your daughter's teacher if she can find some for you.   
Otherwise, my daughter's teacher gave her a book to help her understand the different articles, and therefore by default the different cases, too. It was from the Kantonaler Lehrmittelverlag St Gallen ( ) so that might be useful, too.   
There's also a Zürich one ( ) and my daughter has used this online for maths, and I'm assuming it might have some good language stuff as well.   
You could also try something like Duolingo:   and I'm sure there must be lots of other apps out there.   
Good luck!

			Hi all, 
We are 6 students of german. We have just finished A1 and some colleages are not continuing. 
We are missing at least one person so they don't cancel the A2 course.   
The course takes place Mo, Tue and Wed from 18:00 to 20:05. We are a very collaborative and motivated group and we would like to continue together and keep the same excellent teacher we have now.   
The course is at EB Zurich in Kanonengasse close to Zurich HB and Langstrasse. It will start on Feb the 16th. 
The price is 1590 for the full 6 months.   
If you are looking for a A2 course we'll be more than happy to welcome you to the class.   
Here is the link with full information and for inscriptions:     
For any questions please reply or PM   
Best!

			Hey Dan,   
I moved to Lugano 3 months ago from London. I have studied at the ILI school near the station for the last 2 months and was really unimpressed so I am also looking to change! As you have found out it is REALLY difficult online.    
I have been recommended the Migros language school in the centre but I am yet to try it out.   
What I would say about ILI is they only seem to care about the money you are paying. They gave me my start date and put me in a class much, much higher than my level (which they tested when I started!). When i complained they argued back that this was my level - trust me it wasn't. I can speak a little and understand practically nothing and this was a class that had been studying for 5 months full time! It was a constant struggle and when I was finally put in my correct level the class was 14 when they promise a maximum of 10. Half the people don't pay as it is where they send the unemployed so you end up being with people who don't care, try and waste alot of time.   
For an intensive course you will be looking at around 1000 - 1200 francs a month which (I think) is around 700 - 800 pounds. This doesn't include accomodation or anything but I do know some of the schools do this.   
I will try and keep you posted on what I find out as hopefully it will be easier for me being here.   
GOOD LUCK!!!   
Katie

Gasmask. The first syllable is usually pronounced with a short ""a"", but seldom, if ever, as ""ar"". The second syllable may be short ""a"" or ""ar"". The educated southern English pronunciation would be:   
Gas marsk.   
Of course, American English gives you gaas maask.

			I would not recommend Migros Klubschule. I am aware they are very cheap, but my wife made a course with them (German for beginners) and her experience was not good. The classes were really slow and mostly they were losing their time doing silly games. If I would be you (I also studied at ETH) I would take one of the courses at the University of Zurich and study a lot by my own (this is key when learning a language).    
Also, I recommend you to do Tandem-Learning. The University of Zurich offers the possibility to register in a pool of people looking to do tandem and when they find a match they will contact you. Here is the  . I did it as a student and helped me a lot! Good luck!

			It seems to me that in spoken French most people don't care. It's certainly classy to get it right, but it's not a disaster to use the indicative. Similarly, as someone mentioned, saying ""je sais pas"" without the ""ne"" is very frequent and not a big mistake, but it is not classy - I never do it  .   
I read an email this week which included ""il faut que j'est..."". Oh dear, it should be the subjunctive of avoir : ""aies"" (or is it ""aie""? wtf). The (French) writer knew that the subjunctive was needed, but didn't know how to spell it... Moral of the story: Foreigner learners - don't sweat what doesn't really matter!

			the Pimsleur stuff is fine for asking complete strangers how to get to Bahnhofstrasse, but is completely useless for understanding the directions you will be given.  it will be even more useless if you want to be able to understand people from Basel.

Yes, the pet words and idioms are horribly difficult and can vary wildly from village to village, but that is true for every language.

At ENAIP the B livel is splitted in 3, each of it last 5 weeks or at least it was that way some months ago. I've checked now and i think that they reduced it to 4 weeks and it is even cheaper.  
Here is the link to ENAIP in case that you need it.    
In my opinion EB Zürich is much better.       Here is the link to ENAIP, they dont have C1 courses       
EB Does,   
Cheers, 
Valeria

			Hey Guys,   
I am living in Basel and currently do not have a job yet, because I am still learning German. Since I don't have a job then I try to minimize my expenses, e.g. I am learning German in Loerrach, where the language school is much cheaper than in Basel.   
Now I am interested to learn French, I have learned French about 4 years ago and have an A2 DELF Certification, but it's been a while and I really have to brush up a little bit and maybe do it from A1 again.   
Is there any French Language schools in the France near Basel, something like Saint Loius, if there is I am sure it is definitely cheaper than in CH.   
Thank you guys   
AC

But again trying to work out what's best, online, download etc? Online seems to have mobile apps? Also an advanced version which seems to mean more flexible, rather that advanced as in B2/C1 ..

			Hi iboocheeky,   
If you have a smartphone, the easiest thing is to use the CFF or TL apps . Just insert the address (Rue de Geneve 60) and it'll tell you how to get there. The thing is, if you use the exact address it might not find very frequent combinations.   
Another strategy is to go to one of the main stops close by like Flon, Chauderon, or Vigie. These all have more frequent combinations and you can just walk from there.   
In your case, I think 66 stops at St Francois, right? If so, from St Francois you can just take bus 17 until stop recordon or boston (I'm not sure which stop is closest) and walk 5 min.   
Hope this helps,   
Dan

Otherwise I think they also offer private lessons.

			A surprisingly accurate explanation! Are you a linguist? I especially liked these two sentences because they are best describing what it is about with our language:      There is a little objection, however: Instead of saying Swiss German, you should use the lingustically correct expression Alemannic. That's the language spoken in the (French) Alsace, in Baden-Württemberg, some regions of Bavaria (Germany), Vorarlberg (Austria), in the Southern part of Liechtenstein - and Switzerland. Using this expression would avoid plenty of misunderstandings. But I know, the Swiss will come up soon and oppose. They think Alemannic is only spoken in (Southern) Germany - and no Swiss wants to be confused with a German. Another old story...

			Hi,   
I am looking for someone to who can provide private one-to-one German lessons. I studied A1 a couple of years ago at Bilingua and can read to a better standard having picked up things just by being here. However, I never write in German and my spoken German is very basic. I do not want to return to evening classes as I will miss too many through travel. Therefore flexibility of timing is important for me. Ideally I would like to have two one hour lessons per week if we can find the time. I would be able to do lessons during the day time (if you could come to my work - located near Hardbrücke) and evenings / weekends.   
In addition, my girlfriend is also looking for private lessons. Her level is much greater than mine, hence we would not want to do lessons together. In addition, we have recently had a baby so she would be looking for someone willing to come to our flat (also near Hardbrücke).   
Please let me know if you can help   
Thanks 
Chris

""dire"" is female singular. My guess is, it's an acronym, like OH (other half), that stands for the girlfriend.   
As for automatic translation: 
How do you use patterns when words have just two or three letters, some of which may even have been left out, or differ completely from dialect to dialect?   
Many words have multible meanings, how do you determine which is the right one? How do you decide if ""tits"" denotes the bird or the irresistible thingies?

I am appearing for Deutsch B1 Prüfung in a month's time and am looking for some dos and donts for different sections of the test (especially the written and spoken sections).    
I have searched through the EF forum for past questions and answers and I am asking this question here as I understand the test format from last couple of years has changed.    
Your tips and advise will be very helpful. Also any suggestions on the best test prep materials will be highly appreciated.   
Thanks, PT

My husband and I just moved to Basel from the US.  Neither of us speak German and are interested in taking private lessons this fall with the goal of joining a group class in January.  I've already contacted a number of the language schools in Basel, but any recommendations would be great!

			Have a look at     - from the combined Walser, who spread out from the Wallis over the past centuries.   
they offer for one thing, a VHS (!) based language  course. Otherwise there are a few books that will give you further glimpse. Might be a good start.

			I am looking for a German teacher willing to do one or two hours per week class. I am Spanish, although fluent in English.   
Initial level is zero and I am not looking to pass any exam nor acquire an outstanding level, just to understand and make me understand in the day to day activities (our children's teacher, shops, janitor...).   
My budget would be around 50 CHF per hour.

			Hi Swiss German Learners      
  I found this site very nice for people trying to learn Swiss German or specifically Bern German, you might need some assistance from a work colleague or a partner for pronunciation as well for differentiating between similar expressions, but overall I see it as a good start -        
 All the best of luck to all learners and have a good day ahead.

Unless you manage that risk, of course. The answer to the question on the form, if you are self-employed, is a big fat ""yes"" because if your clients don't pay, you don't get paid. And it's your risk to manage. Unlike an employee who has a contract with their employer to exchange their time for a regular salary, regardless of what happens in the business (as a rule).

			I am looking for the 4th person to start a course at my school.   
Bridge course B1_B2    
The course is aiming to improve grammar, understand complex texts, clear understanding on various topics, on spontaneous and fluent conversation.   
Would be great to have a course in such a small group, plus, you get a discount if you give my name. I also get one if I bring someone.   
Contact me for details. I would like to start as soon as possible, that's why I am posting this here. If the course starts in only 4 people, even better. It will be twice a week, for 5 weeks in total.   
(I am just a student, not working at any language schools, so not trying to promote any business here but this school just seems to get it right.)

I would like to ask you for tips, help, advice, about languages school in Ticino Switzerland. I want to go there somewhere in Januari to learn Italian.    
I am 24 years old and graduated college with a bachelor's degree in Hotel- and Eventmanagement. I am really interested in different languages and that is why I want to learn Italian. 
I am half Dutch, half Swiss (almost have my Swiss passport), so I don't think I would need a permit or anything like that.   
I am having a hard time figuring out what languages school there are in Ticino to learn Italian. If i go to Ticino, where I schould go and everything around it.   
If you have any information for me, please comment on my post.   
Kind regards,

			It's helpful if you're switching on the subtitles in German. In that way you can understand the Swiss German and learn some words you didn't know before. It's helping me to improve my German too, I watch German televison with German subtitles, and grab my dictionary when I need to.

			Hi,     
I am considering starting a A1 Japanese course at Klubschule Migros in Bern next week ( ). However, I find the pricing of the learning material (188 CHF, or 25% of the whole cost) extremely high. Can someone (preferrably having done a A1 course with Klubschule and this book / CD / other material) confirm whether that price appears justified?     
Also, would you have the reference of the material used, so that I can see whether I can find it second hand (I'll also check with Migros KS directly, but they probably will want to sell me the course and book at full price before I can have a look at it)?     
Thanks     
Tom

			Hi Everyone,    
It is probably a very long shot, but I am looking for people interested in learning ... Polish language:-)    
At the moment my husband is finishing his A0/A1 course at Allegra school in Zurich and they are missing 1 more person to continue the course in autumn.  
The classes take place once a week after work (6:30 at the moment, 7:00 pm could be an option too).    
Is there anyone with basic knowledge of Polish here, who is interested in joining the course? :-)  
It won't be too advanced of course, but some basic knowledge is required.

But nice to know how people tend to flip out cause of the meaning of others. 
I just wanted to say that some people should read what I asked. 
You mean that my written English is rubbish and terrible. That is ok, but this is no reason for me to insult somebody.   
NigerianBusinessman was so nice and wrote the text completely new. His sentences are similiar to my text, but the problem now is that I can't compare his sentences with them of mine. That are different styles of writing a text. But anyway I will try to compare.  
And you say that my English is rubbish and you also don't tell me what is wrong.   
You are right, I should've written about the positive things with the teacher Paddy. But it was really bad there and I think a complaint should generally contain negative things what they should change for other people. Otherwise I wouldn't have written one.    
But I didn't want to annoy somebody here. So have a good day.

			Hello all,   
Thought I would share a website with all which lists out all the facilities in Baden for German language learning...       
A few comments on whats on the list:     - heavily depends on the teacher you get stuck with... (therefore a lot of mixed reviews from this institute      - slightly cheaper option but again... right from the very start the tutor may only speak German. So if you don't know a word of German... better get starting practice from elsewhere and then go here.       - Good place to    because at the beginning they are slow, take their time and get repetitive in teaching you... so it may seems dragged out if are comfortable with A1-A2. However if you just want to learn conversational German (skip the professional certificates and grammar) I would highly recommend -  A friend managed to cover got from A1 to B2 in 2 years.      - personally I don't know many that have been here.. so if anyone has had any experience with these institutes feel free to share .. i would really like to know their reviews.

			I was in your situation when I first came here so can comment from that perspective and also teach English so can comment from a teacher perspective. I signed up for private lessons as I needed the flexibility to have the lessons when I was here so I didn't miss any steps in the learning. 10 lessons were around 900chf and this would last me for between 20 and 30 weeks as I couldn't always go every week. My progress was slow but there was progress over the couple of years I had that set up.    
If you join a class and then can't go to some if the classes the teacher won't spend the time getting you up to speed as it wastes time for everyone that was at all the classes. You then end up with gaps of what has been covered and have to guess the in between info. It's also a waste of money.    
The language school where I teach has an online course called E-Learning through Rosetta Stone. It's not perfect but can be ok for people who are prepared to get on with it themselves and don't need a teacher spelling it out the whole time. It's also less expensive.    
I don't rate duolingo as anything other than a fun app. It has a lot of mistakes in terms of the meanings from German to English as doesn't provide any explanations. I suggest it to my students as a fun way of practicing in their free time but not as their only learning method.

I must admit that you might remember Züridüütsch with less High-German ""infuse"" than the usual talk one hears in real life. But it's more a question of life style: Modern life is linguistically expressed in High-German adapted to dialect grammar and phonetics. The farther one is from modern life style, the more distant from Züridüütsch a given dialect seems to be. It's just due to what one talks about, not the dialect in itself.

			I just had a trial lesson with Easy Languages and thought it was worth a sharing. I can't find anywhere that they have been mentioned before or anything recent about online lessons - but apologies if I have missed something.     
I studied to end of A2 with Allegra in Zurich but haven't been able to commit to more classes as I travel a lot and am away usually at least 1 week every month.  
I also don't get much practice so what I did learn has not been put to use.    
A friend suggested these guys and so I gave them a try and so far I am impressed. They are under 100Euro for 5 x 1 hour lessons. You pay by credit card online and can chooses your lesson times. They seem to be quite flexible in that you can switch teachers easily if you aren't happy and as long as you cancel in advance you don't loose the lessons.  
I have just signed up for 10 lessons and will take it from there. I am concentrating on conversation German, and they are going to email me a text that we will discuss in the lesson,  but you can also work from text books and towards tests.

			Don't want to rain on your parade, but I wonder if your employers have been abiding by the non-EU hiring rules.  If you applied and got a job in less than 10 days, then I very much doubt that your employer went through the process to prove to the Swiss authorities that they couldn't find a Swiss, EU national or someone else already living here with a valid work permit to do that job.  If they did, then that's an amazing turnaround time because this usually takes months.     
This is what they should have done:       
What permit do you have Madchen?

We regularly go to Bristol with Swiss students. I personally love it there. In terms of which is better for learning the language: doesn't matter. What matters is the quality of the school and whether you travel with other Swiss students (which means you'll speak more German than English). Another factor is where you stay: you wont speak much English if you stay in a hotel room but will profit much more in a his family.

I am looking for someone to practice French with in Bern, around 1 hour a week.   
In exchange I could either pay or do an exchange of languages (English or Spanish).   
If you are interested, please PM or post here.   
Thanks!

			I'm in a perennial state of trying to learn German -- not with great success, admittedly. I like podcasts, and thought I'd drop in to mention the most recent one I've found that seems particularly useful. I have no relationship of any sort with these people, apart from being a subscriber.   
It's called Dazpod ( ). There is a free version that gives you a weekly podcast featuring a brief sketch, followed by some explanation. Typically, an episode lasts 15-20 minutes. All of this is in German, so note that the standard is not for complete beginners. They divide the material into Beginners and Intermediate level, but in reality you need to be at least A2.    
You can also upgrade to a paid version for 3 euros a month. For this, you get the podcasts plus a full transcript of each episode. Personally, I find this essential to enable me to look up words. But the cost is very low, so no complaints.   
What i like most about this one is the professionalism of the material. The couple acting out the sketches sound like pro actors, or certainly experienced teachers. And there is also a lot of humour and insights into German culture. I repeat - the material consists mainly of little playlets, which may not satisfy everyone. There are no long explanations about the finer points of grammar. It focuses on increasing vocabulary, understanding usage, and above all, listening practice.   
My only minor grumble so far is that there is no comprehensive   provided, so it means a lot of looking up. But for 3 euros, you can't have it all.   
Well worth a try.

			Hello everyone   
my name is Bo. I am a kind Beijinger who stay a bit in China, in US and in CH for my past 30 years. I just move to Zurich and would like to make new friends here and practice my German (A1). I can speak Mandarin and English. For meeting up, we can choose Zurich, Aarau and Dubendorf.    
As a world travel, i developed a lot of hobbies such as, photography (amateur), film, hiking in the mountain, cycling in the field, electronics fans, chess or board games, and cooking lol    
I am open minded and regularly nice, sometimes a bit geek when talking about consumer electronics. :P   
Let me know if you would like to meet up for a casual talk with a cup of beer!

			if you are going into Finance, learn French.  yes, the German-speaking part of Switzerland has a banking sector, but it is inbred, strongly caters to local hires and is much more private-banking as opposed to pure finance focused.  and the finance markets in Germany and Austria (where your German would also help) are not particularly attractive, and will pay far less than elsewhere in Europe.   
with French, you will have the financial markets in the French-speaking part of Switzerland open to you, as well as the finance markets in France (Paris) and Luxembourg (which also trends toward private banking but is much stronger in private equity and other pure finance markets).   
lastly, the French language instruction at a US university will be tenfold better than the German language instruction.       
P.S. in the interest of full disclosure, I learned German and Swiss German, but I'm a lawyer and the legal markets are completely different than the finance markets.  in my experience, lawyers and engineers in central Europe speak German, and people in finance (again, leaving aside private banking) speak French.

			This just won't work because of the language + cultural requirements- eg an Au Pair goes to a country to be immersed in the local language, culture, etc, and follow a language course. Also they cannot have sole charge of young children- and can't work for more than 30 hrs, 50% of which with one of the parents present (part of the immersion requirement and for safety reasons).   
An Au Pair cannot be employed to teach her own language to the children - as that would totally defeat the object. When we employed Au Pairs in the UK, we had to speak English only at home (even though 2 of the Au Pairs were from French speaking Switzerland, like me).

			I did an intensive course for 3 weeks at Innsbruck university when I first arrived.    
It is direct on the train from here, and a gorgeous city. It is not hard to find accommodation, as there are either hostels, or you check out the university notice boards for sub-leases as it is summer holidays.    
They also have activities organised daily in the afternoons.

			I'm a Duolingo fan for sure.  I use both the app on my iPad and the website on my PC. They are slightly different.  When I'm doing a new lesson I try to use the computer because it offers more explanation, conjugations, discussion with other people, etc. I tend to use my app more for strengthening skills and challenging others to a competition for speed practice. I also like it because when you go back and strengthen skills they are usually more difficult than they originally were, incorporating new words or grammatical problems.    
I've been using it since January and I can tell a huge difference in my ability!   
For beginners, I really liked Michael Thomas's 8 hour program. Within a few days I felt comfortable enough to at least open my mouth and try to speak the language.  He also explained relationships among words and sounds that has really helped. (Unfortunately, not a free app.)   
I also have iLang, Lingo Arcade and Kleine Grammatik apps for very basic vocabulary and really great charts.    
Finally, my husband has been reading stuff on FB from ""German Language Learners (Wir lernen Deutsch)"" and I'm going to start looking at that also.

			There also is an other exam that you might want to take in consideration:   
it is the ""TCF"" = test de connaissance de français   
This one is cheaper, and you can not fail, because it's more like an evaluation test. However, it is just a comprehension test. 
You are given grammar, reading and listening score.   
E.G. you might be C1 in reading, but, say, B2 in listening.   
Good luck

			Well I was half way to Northampton when I noticed I was going the wrong way recently (and not to Leicester... from Market Harborough).   
OH has no sense of orientation- but I instinctively know where North/South/E/W are. My brother and I were trained very young. Dad yould take us mushroom hunting and tell us, you go this way and I'll go the other- meet you at such and such a place in 30 mins, etc. Perhaps he was trying to lose us, bless him, but he never managed. We learnt to 'feel' our way, reading the moss on the trees and other signs- strangely enough it also serves me really well on roads or in towns (well, not the moss on the trees generally).

No one here is going to go through your text and point out every single error that you have made.

Or 
""Leonard Thoma"" 
There are several short stories in 1 book. 
Usually 3 or 4 pages for each story.   
Aimed at level A2. 
I really enjoyed them.

			Hello,     
I am an English trainer that has experience with telephone and Skype for training professionals and I would say that it is effective.  You can get immediate corrections if the teacher is alert and written corrections as well.  You can view each others pdf files and send links.  It is actually a bit more demanding orally as you are forced to speak the whole time.  If you were looking for a teacher to explain and other classmates to listen to than this may not be the route for you.  Most of the people I have talked to really do enjoy it but there are pros and cons.  At this moment, I am learning French this way and I am enjoying it but I knew what I was looking for and have a great teacher.  Normally, this is a cheaper option as there are fewer expenses.     
Good luck!

			I learned both, more or less at the same time although the opportunities for speaking Swiss German in Zürich far exceeded the opportunities for speaking German.  an A2 to B1 level understanding of standard German was very, very helpful for me in navigating Swiss German, but you can always learn the basics of both at the same time.  learning both meant that my standard German suffered (and still suffers, especially when speaking), which is a downside when trying to speak German outside of Switzerland or with German friends and colleagues.   
I have never had anyone switch to English when I speak dialect with them (Germans simply respond in German), when I try in standard German it is more of a mix.  I have also never had anyone react with anything other than surprise and a smile at my learning and speaking dialect, other than German friends and colleagues who cannot imagine why I would bother.   
good luck whichever path you choose, German is a harsh mistress but learning the language can also be fun.      "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Nov 2013	Groaned at 7 Times in 7 Posts	Learning German: Swiss, High or both?	lucy_who	Posts: 642	1,128	6	Language corner

I agree the Swiss have French words that my French translation package and French books have never heard of.  Often words ending in ...age.  Gypserie is another word that doesn't translate in ""proper"" French.  Something to do with painting and paints I guess as it's often alongside peinture on business signs.   
Paillard is French French though; it means lecherous or bawdy.

			One should not be too hard on talkative cashiers, as to some, the chit-chat may be an attempt, as clumsy and untimely as it may be, to socially and romantically connect with their peers. While certainly less noble and conducive to chance encounters leading to an exchange of phone numbers than waiting at a trendy café or restaurant, cashiers do get to briefly ""meet"" a lot of people in a day. To them, those brief but real encounters at the till might bring much needed comfort after continuously experiencing dismal failures on dating sites.

the school is registered with 
TELC as an approved institution, hence we are going with TELC. 
Does anyone have details? 
Are they both the same difficultly ? 
Same ""worthiness""? 
Should I sit both, just to increase my chances of passing??

			I am assuming you mean GCE A levels, which are taken at 18 (as opposed to GCSEs, which are taken at 16).    
I have an A grade in A level French. I didn't use my French for around ten years, and then moved here and was assessed as B1 moving towards B2.    
With a C grade, I'd therefore say no higher than B1.

			Are you taking classes, and where? What level? And what sort of work are you looking for? Not easy and I sympathise, but in many ways your wife is right- the sooner you crack the language, the sooner you will be able to get out of this rut you sadly got yourself stuck in.   
Hope you do find the light at the end of this horrible Tunnel. Summer is on its way and it will be much easier- walking along the beach, sitting out in Cafés. What do you enjoy doing? Have you been out to discover some of the wonderful sights around Colombier, both by the lake, in town (s) and the mountains nearby? I know the rubbish weather these last few days are not helping- but Summer is defo on the way- s don't despair, honest.   
miniMia- yes a shame that so many teachers still have that mentality of teaching stuff which even educated natives would not have a clue about - not just in Switzerland either- very much the French way too, perhaps more so as this is the way teachers are trained and promoted (eg on sophisticated Grammar and Literature and not on the ability to communicate or teach). Although at C1 level, it does make sense to begin to tackle more complicated structures- as long as it is not 'just to trip people up' but to genuinely increase their communicative level. More appropriate at C2 imho. But it is totally inappropriate with beginners and intermediates- where a much better skill is to learn how to avoid difficulties but swapping to another way of saying things- or just learning difficult structures for passive understanding rather than active use. (for instance avoiding the Passé Simple- and using perfect tense + imperfect/ or avoiding structures with the subjunctive, like -je dois aller, instead of - il faut que j'aille, etc).

			What level are you doing? If it's B1 then you should bear in mind that this is very much made up of grammar alone. I did my German courses with ZHAW and must say they that although expensive, were head and shoulders above the other courses I did in Switzerland.   
Have you tried speaking to your tutor? As far as I remember, mine were very approachable with ZHAW and even said if we found we were spending too much time on one area (i.e. grammar) we should say something and they would act to change it. I would recommend trying this out before demanding your money back.

			You're going to need a police statement from China. Then you will have to pay to have a 'certified' translation into German(y) in order for it to be valid.   
If authorities were just going to take your word, they wouldn't bother asking the question.   
I'm afraid that even if someone does help you with this, it will be of no help to you at all.... in fact, not helping you is perhaps more help.   
Please contact your local police department in China to issue a statement.

			Has anyone good any good recommendations for good audio books for learning German?     
I'm back in the UK these days trying to learn German so I can get myself back out to Basel. Audio books are prefect for me since I'm otherwise wasting 2 hours a day commuting to and from work.   
I've just complete the Paul Noble audio books, they helped a lot but they've not really gone that far and they avoid anything even slightly complicated.   
I've been looking at the Michel Thomas series all day trying to decide if they're worth having but at £40 and £80 I'm not sure if I should go with them or try and find something else.

			I've done 2 in the series but none were of the month long intensive variety.   
Like anything, depends on the instructor you get - I actually switched out of the A1 course with one because she was so painfully boring and useless that I knew I'd never stick with it...But interestingly enough, I had 2 great ones in the end...Met some terrific people as well   
I have nothing to compare it to but I believe, in gneneral, Migros' courses are well respected with many who have gone through them...I'm actually thinking of heading back to continue with my French

			Hi. I'm recently thinking of taking the DELF exam, but I'm not sure if it is worth doing.   
I currently work in an English speaking company. But in the future I want to widen my career possibilities in French speaking companies too as I mainly live in the Suisse romande part and most jobs require French.   
I use French every day in my life (my partner, all the family-in-law, most friends only speak French), but I've never used it in a working/profession environment. I studied several sample test materials and I feel that I can take the B2 level (without special preparation), or the C1 level (after some preparation and familiarization with the test).   
My question: is the DELF test really worth taking? How much importance the future employer will put on it? I mean, if it is a French speaking company they can judge your French skill well during the interview. Right? Or does putting DELF diploma in the CV will simply increase the chance of being shortlisted and interviewed?   
Someone has some experience?

I bought this from one of the tourist shops in basel.   
You can also get it from Amazon.de for less.   
I would recommend it to anyone who would like to improve or start learning Baseldütsch/dyytsch. It is the only book I know of with english translations from basel german.    
Mostly failry basic with pictures, phrases and everyday words, but also quite comprehensive with a small amount of syntax and grammar information, and comparisons with standard german.    
I think the same publisher has a book called ""hoi"" for learning swiss german too, (mostly based on zuri deutsch).

			Naturally, you can learn 2 languages simultaneously. Think about the children of parents of different mother tongues. Learning becomes more challenging as we become older, so be prepared for language interference in your learning. You say you are bored with German; finding ways to maintain motivation in any learning, will increase chances of success. Maybe you can find a study buddy?

Considering you opened such a thread as your first post, doesn't give you any credit whatsoever as to your intentions or otherwise.     
You want a helpful post, then here's one:   
When you allow trust to disintegrate to a point you search for confirmation, you only ever make things harder on yourself.   
It's not important what the text says, what is important is that trust has been broken and you are looking for some sort of 'confirmation' for what you already assume.   
You are only feeding your insecurity by trying to find evidence that you are right. Feeding this insecurity only makes you feel more shit..... and when you DO find the evidence - then you feel even more shit.   
So why punish yourself?   
What you should do is confront the person directly about this, particularly if you haven't ""snooped"" through a phone and someone has read this to you.   
If you don't trust the person after you have dealt with the person, then WTF are you doing with them?   
My advice,  
let the message go and deal with it face to face.

			Hi all,   
I passed the Goethe language exam a few years back for B1, but cannot find the confirmation. Does anyone have the same experience? Does anyone know how I can get a copy of this? Should I go back to the school I took the test at or write directly to the Goethe Institute?   
Thank you for any advice.

			Hi to all German speakers in the Lausanne area!   
We meet on a Monday night, twice a month, in Lausanne to speak German together. You don't have to be perfect and it doesn't matter if you make mistakes (we certainly do  ) but if you're looking to practise your German or share your experiences of German-speaking culture in a relaxed atmosphere then this is the place for you!    
Send me a message if you're interested and I'll give you the necessary details.   
Bis bald!

703	09.02.2014, 23:56	Forum Veteran	Thanked 578 Times in 275 Posts	Location: Rotkreuz ZG	"    Well there is another argument, you are married, right? Since couples complete one return and file together, this would mean your spouse would also need to give this right.    
I think you would be well within your rights to let the designated firm complete the return, then you check it over in detail before signing and submit it directly. No vollmacht given. If they won't agree then complete it yourself.    
I have always found the tax department to be quite open to answering questions.   
BUT, when we lived in Asia there was zero chance we could file and submit our own tax return. The company handled this for us. I provided my information to my husband's employer. There really was no other option.

			Can't help as I'm in Lugano but I was thinking about 'teaching' English conversation.  Has anyone done this on a (very) part-time basis?   
I've just been to the British Council in Milan to enquire about the CELTA online course.  The time / cost / commitment part isn't what's stopping me; moreover a case of ""what if I obtain the CELTA certificate and can't stand teaching?"".  At least by dipping my toe in the water so to speak by teaching conversation I could see if I am cut out for it.   
Any opinions / feedback would be most welcome.   
Thank you.

			Well, after the first lesson, I wrote to them.  They were very apologetic and were kind enough to not charge me anything if I were not satisfied after the second lesson.  Well, I wasn't satisfied after the second lesson, but I did insist on paying for the two lessons, and also for the booklets and recordings (which I do find helpful in the absence of a teacher).  They again were quite apologetic and agreed.  Overall, the staff have been very kind and very quick to respond to emails.

			Hi,  
My name is Sergio and I'm from Spain. 
Have you considered to practice Spanish conversation with native Spanish by videoconference? 
It's very cheap.Here you can find a pair of people who now is giving this kind of courses.  
Even you can give courses of your mother tongue or other ability you have and earn money with that.

			Hello!    
My boyfriend and I have been in Zurich several months now but working full-time and long hours mean that we are finding it VERY difficult to get to grips with our basic German. He is more advanced than I am, but that's not hard to beat as I can barely count to ten... 
We're after help with general pronounciation of the language and a start to basic German converstaion. New vocab we can learn in our own time once we know the correct way to go about pronouncing words correctly and constructing sentences!  
Is there anyone who may be able to help? We are looking for perhaps 60/90 minute tutorials on Saturdays or Sundays - we can be flexible with the time of day I would say.  
Thanks for reading...here is my email address if anyone would like to message me:<removed>

Currently I am ranked 1.6million out of 7 million, not too bad considering I don't understand a lot of the questions.     
The questions are not   calibre and its no surprise that I am beating native speakers. Its hard being a genius.

I'm really keen to improve as it's difficult to make myself understood in shops and impossible to understand official letters at the moment. I'm using duolingo each day and will look out for the workbooks and a chance to snap up some of the other resources.   
I've also found a newspaper that's given out for free and also available online   and am trying to translate a few headlines each day. I'm a total beginner so don't understand a word but google translate is brilliant.      was also good motivation for learning German. I'm dying to be able to read simple books to my 7 month old son and when I can read Harry Potter I know I've made it with German proficiency  .

Interesting side note on the dialects: I have a friend who grew up in Berne and her boyfriend's from Basel. He told me that, when he goes to see her parents, that he only understands 50-75% of what they tell him. That's just nuts. Anyone else have similar experiences in such regional variations?

			Hello everyone! 
I have been studying German for few months now and I would like to find a partner (german speaking) with whom meeting for a coffee or a drink and practicing my language skills (I am currently advanced A1/beginner A2). 
I can provide help with Italian or English in exchange, so we could organize sessions during which we could switch between two languages in order to practice together.   
PM me if interested so we can arrange a meeting.

			I know that in Basel, they speak a different kind of German, but I use(d) deutsche welle to learn some german. Their site is great and the interactive course (  totally free, just email login registration) is good also. They teach hoch-deutsch, which I believe most Swiss-Germans can also speak and understand. 
The swiss understand my German, though I can't understand the Swiss/Basler German...

			I just went through discussing relocation via e-mail with a bunch of people (in English). It generally went like this: 
- I email them using the formal English letter style (Dear Mr/Mrs LastName/Yours sincerely or if I wasn't sure of their name, Dear Sir/Madam / Yours faithfully) 
- they email back formally but with Best/Kind regards at the end 
- I email in the same way 
- they reply with ""Dear FirstName/Best regards"" or ""Kind regards""   
This has happened 3-4 times so far, so I'm now assuming this is the standard once a few emails have been exchanged. I wonder if it's the same when emailing in German.   
In the UK, I started the same but the greetings quickly turned into ""Hello FirstName"" with ""Best regards"" or ""Kind regards"" at the end.

Exactly the same with Platz -> Plätzchen / Plätzli, Latz (= bib) -> Lätzchen / Lätzli, Platte -> Plättchen / Plättli, Stall -> Ställchen / Ställeli, Ball -> Bällchen / Bälleli, and probably dozens, if not hundreds of other, similar, examples.

Can anyone recommend or know of a german teacher near Seewen, Brunnen, Schwyz?

This post might be kind of pointless because it's an english forum, but perhaps someone is looking for a native english speaker...   
Anyway, I am a 24 year-old Californian looking to improve my french, german, and italian.   
Anyone interested in a language swap near Yverdon? My primary interest is German (B1/2).

			Hi all,   
First off, if this isn't the right forum, please accept my apologies.   
I was wondering if anyone here can recommend a service in Geneva where I can get a certified translation done from English into German and/or French.   
The translation needs to be top-notch and the translator must be able to certify it, as the translated documents will be going to the cantonal and afterwards (hopefully!) federal officials.   
Thanks a lot, 
George

Talk in German whenever possible, even when you feel embarrassed by your poor skills. Read, read, and listen... 
I studied French and English in school, and had a very basic knowledge of  German before moving here but now I am ready  for the C1  level exam.  It is possible, but you have to put some effort into this, constantly.

			I have been using the Pimsleur audiobooks from iTunes.  I believe they have given me a good background in important phrases and verbs.  And, with repetition, I am picking up on some of the unique things about the German sentence structure and word order.   
I also have been playing with DuoLingo. 
It has been useful in giving me more nouns.

			you will not find learning materials from English to Swiss German that are worth much.  if you are serious about learning the language, I would start with standard German A1 and purchase one of the excellent learning books that are available from standard German to Swiss German.  With effort you can get sufficiently though A2 in standard German in about 3-6 months to start muddling through the learning materials into Swiss German.   
in the meantime, watch as much tv as you can, there is all kinds of Swiss German tv and comedy programming on youtube, for example:          "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Dec 2013	Groaned at 2 Times in 1 Post	Audiobooks in Swiss German	dna1962	Posts: 3	984	1	Language corner

			I am/was in a similar situation as yours and I just took and passed the TELC B2. I took a prep course (via Migros Klubschule) and it helped a lot. I would also recommend really forcing yourself to do the practice tests and noting the time.   
But if you really want to get better, you have to practice conversation. I also can still be tongue tied in front of 5 year olds!   Good luck.

Of course, there are many more factors that affect pricing such as client's ability to pay, which is likely to come into play in academia - but there is a balance between the two. Undercharging in any field ultimately does nobody any good because it stops money moving around the economy.

			Hi All,   
I would like to pick up the pace with my German (high) and this would be ideal if someone wants a native English speaker to exchange with on an informal basis.    
I am A1 level and need more practise. It would ideally be at lunch time during the week, not a specific day or time every week, but generally once a week on a mutually convenient day.    
I work in finance so this might also appeal to business people if you are at a high level in English.   
kind regards   
D

I know ""trendy"" is a relatively subjective word, so this is the kind of music I look for: 
- minimal 
- afrobeat 
- indie 
- anything new, tasteful & not-highly-commercial (ie. no britney spears)   
I'm a fan of   (French radio station), so if you know anything similar that'd be great.

That said, @debra says something important here that most job hunters get wrong (particularly at the younger end of the scale).    
Most people involved in recruitment will recognise this problem. If I'm looking for someone to fill that sales or techie role (or whatever), I want to know if this person will help me and the company do the job. If we can help them develop their skills and experience along the way, well that's nice, but it's not why we are looking for a new person to join us.

			Hello all, 
as resident of 3 nations border, Im stuck with the fact that, to be in the job competition, I have to know ((at least ) 3 foreign popular languages beside my own... Those choices are Deutsch, French and/or Italian.   
After long surveys, I managed to enroll Deutsch course and completed the minimum level of (most) Job field would required.. 
Now wait, what I mean by surveys was about Course Fees and then the quality... Yes, the fee of language course plays big roles as I havent earn good income yet. (The idea to learn language is to get good job)   
Now, My post is about French or Italian language course...     
If any of you have information and experience about cheap (and hopefully good)   near the border of Weil am Rhein (that will be Basel, Swiz and Huninge,France)..Plisss pleaseeee let me know..     
Hoping for enlightenment

			Okay, good news and bad news... Do you know Radio Eriwan? This is a lot like that.   
Good News: They do, in fact pay for German courses. 
Bad News: You need to be officially unemployed for that.   
Good News: Being unemployed is not too difficult. 
Bad News: In order to qualify as officially unemployed you'll have to have worked in Switzerland for a number of days. Unless there are different rules for recent immigrants.   
Good News: They might actually pay all of it. 
Bad News: They will make you apply for and take any job that sortakinda fits your profile.   
Good News: That's not a bad thing. 
Bad News: There aren't any bookstores that are not only willing to hire someone who barely speaks any German in St. Gallen. There's the Rösslitor, who is part of the Orell Füssli group. Huge bookstore, full of twits, has everything but books and ridiculous requirements as to qualifications of their staff. That's pretty much the only bookstore that pays decent wages. There's also Comedia down the Katharinengasse. They struggle to survive. They have struggled to survive for the past decade or so.    
Good News: I'm fresh out of good news. 
Bad News: Bookshops aren't your best bet, currently. Orell Füssli (aka. Big Bookstore Chain #1) is having a fusion with Thalia (aka. Big Bookstore Chain #2). So personnel cuts are expected.   
There. Bleak and dreary a perspective. Should you go to the RAV and talk to them about your German course. Do not mention that you want to go to work in a Bookshop. Go with ""I want to do what I have qualifications in"".

It's almost impossible to stop Swiss people flicking over to English and you have to actively ask them to keep to German.  It was a nightmare in the early days when I was trying to learn.  It's not a criticism because it was done out of kindness as their language skills were far superior to mine at the time, but I needed that kick up the arse to help me learn German.   
Fortunately, I have some lovely Swiss friends that refuse to speak English to me and mercilessly tease me if I make mistakes but we're usually all pissed on schnapps by then so my German is fluent.

The problem here is that you are mistaking ""adjectives"" for ""adverbs"" and expressions of quantity. Grand(e) / neuf/ neuve are adjectives, so you never use the preposition ""de"" with them. But if you are using an expression of quantity, there you use ""de"": trop de / beaucoup de / un verre de /une grande quantité de ... and so on!  
Hope it helps!

If you're still looking for a teacher, I live in Gland and can give you French lessons at your home. However, you should know that I am not a professionnal teacher, ""only"" a native speaker.

			It is a strange experience to get the danish rules for pronunciation, but it's just a bit of work and habit, like any other language, really. Once one gets it, there are no surprise in the pronunciation in Danish. In English, it's a surprise evey day... even after years of practice.

buon inizio di settimana, come va?   
Sorry but I'm really too far from SH   if you will come in BS please let me know. We can have a conversation in Italian and eventually correct your language mistakes step by step.    
Maybe in the while, think if you are more interested in learning Italian or Swiss Italian, there are some lexical differences.    
Buona giornata,

I know the rates are say, approx CHF40 per hour - but what are the DEDUCTIONS (tax, medical, transport)?   
And are the deductions the same if you work freelance for yourself or for a school?

They also have French books for kids aged 4 and up ( )

But, see, the thing is that there are no rules for when one thing starts and when another ends. I know it's very unswiss, but it's not like ""Morgen lasts from Midnight to exactly 10.23am.""   
If it's to say ""Let's meet tomorrow morning"" or something, then assume that it's Morgen until noon, Nachmittag until dusk, Abend until you go to bed.

The thing is that you still have to do your homework and practice outside the 'classroom' for them to be effective.

			My experience and that of other colleagues is that it doesnt depend on the school but on the teacher. If you are lucky you can get a good one and a mate on the next class a rubbish one. I would try to sit at a couple of classes to try it first.

			Hi there,   
I did it. I went to Berlin for two weeks in July, had intensive german classes and went on excursions with the school.   
I stayed with a host, but she was talking too fast all the time with me even if I asked her to slow down, she said she doesn't do that, that it was like that. I had trains running under my window until midnight and starting again at 4am, and all the night through at weekends. So, if you go, ask details about the bedroom and its surroundings!   
Some of the other student had either the same problem, or the host people were not always here in the evening etc.. Depending on your level, I would recommend you to ask to stay with a family with children. They tend to be more patient and to speak slower.   
About the school, DID institut, it was really really hot in the classroom, no air conditioning and with the windows opened, we were annoyed by the noise outside. Most of the students were young and partying in the evening which means that during the class, they were a bit disconnected, shy to speak etc.. But teachers were very good and very well prepared.   
Between students, we were talking most of the time in English as our level of German was not enough to always say what we wanted to say.   
The city in itself is very interesting and captivating. But having, said that, I am not entirely convinced that it's the best way to learn German.    
However, if you are thinking about going there, you can PM me to have more details on which questions to ask the school.

			Here in Zurich I meet people who learn Russian. And they are, to my surprise, are not so rare. I mean not only German/Swiss people. English speakers also. I can understand those who need to know Russian in Geneve since there are many international organizations and this language can really be if not in demand but in need. But in Zurich?..   
The point is I am a Russian speaker. I am very, no,   literate Russian speaker. To tell more, I am actually a teacher of Russian  well, teacher of English as well, but not a native speaker and it spoils my life (just kidding   ).    
So maybe here are some forum people (or their friends) who want to get some nice Russian language? I don't dare to hope for a tandem actually  I mean German/Russian tandem. But if an english speaker speaks good German  I'd love to get some in exchange, of course.  Don't care about accent, really, I speak two more languages apart from my mother tongue (and understand one more), and I have accent in all of them, so not a big deal, really.    
I am aware this post can go to oblivion quite quickly, but still  hope dies last   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Just curious	Warcraft	Posts: 26	572	0	Language corner

			Dear All,   
I'd quite like to do this 4 day intensive course in scientific writing in German run by the Clinical Trials Unit at the UniSpital Zurich:         
I'm a Brit with B2/C1 level German but could do with a bit of work on my writing.  I contacted the woman in charge of the course and she says it's appropriate for non-native speakers of German.  BUT, they don't have enough sign-ups yet to run it (they need another three students).  So I thought I'd ask on here and see if anyone might be interested.   
Contact Silke Ludwig directly (her email's at the bottom of the linked page).     
Pretty sure it counts as ""integrating"" so tax can be reclaimed.

			400 for 50 lessons is what they told me on the phone and it's in the range of what my acquaintances said (450 chf). Could be that it's 450 with course material in the end.   
They have an info evening mid or end September or just email/ call them for the exact numbers.

Also you may need to ask the other party what they accept as form of certification (i.e. by whom)

			Hi, congratulations on your good news. Perhaps you and your husband could alternate between Dutch and English when your talking together. It's important that you only speak English and your husband only Dutch when speaking directly to your child. The emotional connection to each language should be kept separate, what you all speak together is up to you.

Silly question.  How are you going to immigrate to Switzerland?   
Do you have a Swiss or EU passport?  Will you study in  
Switzerland?   
It is not so easy for non-EU citizens to get work permits in 
Switzerland.

			Ok, it's finally come to this, begging for help.    
I have a little amateur history project going which involves correspondence interviews with people around the world. One of the sources is an alderly German gentlemen. He can write in good English, and his wife, in her eighties I imagine, has impeccable Queen's English in a way that puts most people here to shame. So corresponding is going fine. However, he'd previously written some of his experiences down in a German magazine, which he photocopied and posted to me.    
I have tried translating it via google translate but that's a mammoth task to retype it. It's about four pages.   
So if you have good German, and would enjoy summarizing the article into English that would be a fantastic help. An interest in history or military history would be handy too.      
Please pm me if you are interested in helping.

			The usual recommendation seems to be to learn High German first. You can do courses in Swiss German here in Basel, but they usually require you to have B1 level High German. If you want to study Swiss German as a linguist, the materials would generally be written in High German too.   
That said, your case is a bit different, having a Baslerin for a girlfriend, but I wonder whether you might find it easier to establish a basis in High German before you arrive. It's easier to find materials and it is useful for learning Swiss German later.

			I think it is quite important that each parent speak his/her own mother tongue and the German/Swiss German will come due to the child being immersed in it. Both parents do have to be consistent though.   
Children really amaze you with their ability to take on new languages and switch between them effortlessly.   
Good luck it will be fun and do not be surprised as due to the fact that the child is speaking multiple languages she/he speaks in full sentences later that his peers who are only dealing with one language.

			For me Rosetta Stone has been very helpful. I've managed to learn to communicate on simple daily issues and it has provided a good foundation for future learning. However - it is what you put into it - and it is only a computer program. As my thread indicates - I need more of the conversational aspect which is lacking from the computer program. But otherwise I find it a good value. Once my German is more advanced I plan on buying the French version to help remember those school lessons from so long ago-   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Dec 2008	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Schaffhausen - High German practice / English for German	Michigan68	Posts: 184	2,563	3	Language corner

I think that it is a good idea to visit an intensive language course. I once visited a Spanish intensive course and it really helped me to improve my Spanish. You listen, write, speak in the target language and after a fiew days you also start to think in it.

			I listen to SRF4, a 24 hour Swiss news station, but obviously covers international affairs. I find it great for keeping up to date and keeping 'in tune' with German. The German spoken is generally High German, sometimes an interviewee will speak with a strong local accent or perhaps even in dialect. I play this channel on my tablet/phone using the TuneIn app...

952	27.06.2013, 13:46	Member	Thanked 55 Times in 33 Posts	Location: Zollikerberg	"    Right. There are those rare cases, often somewhat unexpected, like, for instance, the first time I heard Michiganders say, ""Have a nice one"" (read: day), which exactly corresponds to Swiss German ""Heb en schöne"" (read: Tag), or, ""I haven't the faintest / foggiest"" (read: idea), like Swiss German ""I han kein blasse"" (read: Schimmer).    
However, the similarities between phrasal verbs in English and separable verbs in German immediately fade away when it comes to slightly more complicated sentences, where the second part of the phrasal verb automatically gets moved next to the verb, whereas in German there can be lightyears between the two parts.    
Examples: ""She   him  "" / ""Sie   ihn  ."" But: ""She   just about everybody"" / ""Sie   absolut ausnahmslos jeden, der ihr zu irgendeiner Zeit aus beliebigem Grund in die Quere kommt, sei es jemand aus der Verwandt- oder Bekanntschaft oder auch ein Wildfremder, mit boshafter Hartnäckigkeit und unter Einsatz all ihrer ziemlich begrenzten geistigen Möglichkeiten  .""    
Granted, that monster sentence can be restructured to read, ""Sie   absolut ausnahmslos jeden  , der......"", which makes things a little bit easier, but the first version is perfectly correct too.

There is a beginning German course offered on Wednesday evenings, starting 21 August, running through January 2014.

			Tips...   
buy an Amazon Kindle and purchase & install German-English as your primary dictionary (google and you'll find plenty of how-to-guides on this).  I found ""Collins concise German-English Dictionary"" to be the best one available.   This allows you to get a quick translation on any new words quickly just by highlighting/pressing on the word.   
This doesn't work for ipad kindle apps, only true kindles.  With this, it makes it a hell of a lot easier to read normal novels.  I'm at a B2 level and typical Nick Hornby or John Grisham books have been challenging but enjoyable through this.

			Hi, I think Billhardie's response deserve more consideration. Reading newspapers is a great way to improve your German in my view, especially something pretty basic like Blick am Abend or 20 Minuten. Articles are short and generally easy to get the gist of even if you are not a native. In fact, I wish I made more time for it myself!

			To be fair, booking online with Berlitz does take you all the way through payment without offering to show any terms (not sure whether they are shown after that.  I'm not going to pay to see).   
A site search for ""terms"" returns this, which makes no mention of exam cancellation, but does mentions generally that cancelations can be made within 1 week of the conclusion of the contract - which, I guess, would mean that Berlitz are in the right if you cancelled after two (especially if a booking with TELC counts as a service being used).         
It would be nice if it was just a clear part of the booking form though.

			Hoi zäme,   
I am taking the Goethe b1 exam at the end of the month. 
I have been going to class 2x a week for 1 year now but it was always very focused on grammar: We have not done much conversation even though we were a very small group.   
I would like to practise a bit speaking. Anyone taking the exam soon ? It's good to talk to and listen to other beginners + we can do special practice (the examiners like to hear the specific stuff like ""meiner Meinung nach..."") 
I also have a bunch of exams I can share.   
I'm in Zurich. Send me a PM if you want to meet.

All notes, all instructions, all notes ""on the board"", all newspapers, all (at least most) things on the internet, all (almost) books, etc are in Standard German. And the dialect may even differ within a single family. No problem for locals (usually), but a real one for newcomers.

			There are many in Basel at the larger language institutes like Inlingua and GGG.  However, I know of an excellent course that runs in Riehen....a short bus trip from the centre, every Wednesday morning.  They offer conversation courses at basic and intermediate levels with plenty of interesting topics.  And it is all about talking.  The courses do not run during the holidays though...new course begins in August/September 2013.  It is also very reasonable, about 150 CHF for 10 Wednesday morning sessions from 9am-11am.     
Here is the address:   
Verein Miteinander vorwärts 
Kornfeldstrasse 52 
4125 Riehen 
Telefon: +41 78 845 95 79       
Good luck.

			The use of past tense ""thanks for having celebrated this day"" is not unusual, but it's mostly used when for little cards on small thank-you-gifts that are sometimes handed out to the guests after or towards the end of the wedding.   
I would personally use present tense but I don't think it's entirely incorrect to say ""having spent"" on a sign even if it's just a beginning. It just sort of takes it for granted that people will stay for the whole time.

			It's all about the teacher. So if possible, try to get a teacher that is recommended by someone (you trust).    
The best German teacher I ever had was Polish. She knew everything about the grammar and would specifically ask each person, at the beginning of each class, a question about the last class. As a result, you were studying beforehand, what you did the week before, because you didn't want to look a bit dumb.   That was at Migro Klubschule Baden.

			Hello everybody, 
is anyone there who knows something about it in Flyingteacher school? I have fill out the test and I`m now B2/1 but they have only Intensiv and I can`t make it. They offered me also Converastion course which is 2 times per week in the evening but more expensive than Intensiv (790fr + books 40fr) for 10 weeks. I`m not sure if I start with that I`ll move on with my knowledge of German and that I be able to go on with C1 after this one....

			Hi,   
I recently moved to Zurich (Wollishofen) and I am swedish. I am trying to learn German, and would be interested in a ""tandem course"" meaning we meet and teach each other our languages. What do you think? Do you have any thoughts about how often and when you'd like to do this?

			Hello!, I'm Kim   
I wnat to organize the meeting to exchange languages. I saw a post about language exchange here. Basically, they express a sentence in english and then swich to french. It dosen't matter the theme that you want to speak. It's quiet informal and you can talk about whatever you want.  
I think I just follow the rule that they used. we can meet a cafe nere friboug city centre. once or twice a week at same time.  
If you are interested in this, please cantact with me  
P.S I'm from Korea. If you want we can exchange korean too   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Hello, I'm looking for people who want to exchange languages in fribourg!	Kim hyun tae	Posts: 10	750	0	Language corner

			I don't really know, sorry    
The city of Lausanne has a 'department' for the  , and they print/put together this p amphlet which is available for people going to register with the city when they first arrive in Lausanne (the same office to get one's visa).      So perhaps Geneva has an equivalent office for 'integration' that prepares a smiliar document? I understand that most cities offer free language classes though they aren't always easy to find. In fact, I only know about these classes becuase I was in the summer classes offered  by the city and they gave us each a copy of the pamphlet at the end of the course.     I also know of other classes that aren't on this pamplet, and it was only through word of mouth that I know about them. Doesn't really help someone recently arrived, however.

I always adapt my lessons to students' needs: conversation, exam preparation, business italian, one-on-one or groups...

The courses are very cheap onl 410 CHF per month and you have calsses every day. The courses are normally taking place at Central Zürich or at Universitätstrasse.

The details are the same - Thursday evenings 8 - 9:30.   
The cost varies according to the number of partcipants, but currently it is 20 CHF for each 1.5 hour lesson (i.e. 10 francs per 45 minutes, if you want to compare with language schools) when you sign up for a semester.   
Probably best just to do a free trial class and see if it's right for you. Just let me know and I'll inform the teacher.

Übungen und Texte mailen.  
Wir können gerne einen kostenlosen Probeunterricht von 45 Minuten vereinbaren, um zu sehen, ob Skype für Sie in Frage kommt.Ich unterrichte von Montag bis Freitag von 7Uhr bis 22Uhr und Samstag von 8Uhr bis 14Uhr. Sie nehmen soviel Unterricht, wie  
Sie moechten. Die Termine werden zusammen vereinbart.    
Ich habe viele Erfahrungen mit Schülern und Erwachsenen gemacht (Anfänger bis Abitur). Ich bin flexibel und bespreche mit

20,- für 45 Minuten

			I got a quote of 500CHF for Lohnausweis and Salary slip certificate! 
4CHF/50 characters.    
Digging for this information to translate got me good results. My apologies to everyone in EF who might profit from translating such a document, but I thought there could be a cheaper way for all the rest of us!    
For lohnausweis, one can download the German/French/English version from here       
You need a special viewer with which you can fill this form up, and then print it in pdf format. Send it to the HR for confirmation and perhaps a stamp and signature if they are happy with the document. Tutti frutti, costs you time to fill it up and print it, but save you 500swissies!

			Thanks for these recommendations, I will check them out.    
Not exactly podcasts but this pack of short stories cost 10 Euros.  I am really enjoying them as they, so far, seem quite  quirky. You also download the text and there's translation in english plus some questions (w answers) at the end so it's really helpful. It states they are German level a2 - B1 which i think is about right.          
They are from this website which is free and not bad at all.       
I hope that helps someone.    
Anyone know of anything similar as I am enjoying this way of learning. (Actually,  not exactly enjoying, it just seems less painful).   
I also bought Downton Abbey in German with subtitles though only watched the first one. Not sure how effective this is but can't be bad!

			To children under 3, sometimes a little longer, there are no such things as pronouns. They take everything as a noun. They hear you called them ""du"" so they call themselves ""du"" too when speaking, like a name.  
Just add the name to the du/ich or just correct the child. Every child ends up getting it. No worry whatsoever, noway you can push it either.

			Attempt at a diplomatic answer:   
Dear OP, just learn French in Lausanne as much and as long as you want. No problem. The prosody is a bit different but there are many of those within France too. Just watch TV regularly and you'll pick up the main stream accent if you really feel that vaudois French is too special. When you've become fluent in French, you'll notice the 20-30 words typical of Lausanne/Switzerland that are not understood in France and you'll manage to adapt to that too. But that's a question for advanced learners. Don't worry about it now.   
But I wouldn't care at all. French in Lausanne is perfectly fine. Don't loose time thinking about it. Just start learning.   
_________________________     
Less diplomatic answer:    
Dear OP, before you are in a position to ask yourself how your Lausanne French sounds to French ears, you'll have to loose your original accent (English?). That will keep you busy a while.

			I haven't heard this expression for a while. I used it in situation when someone asked me to do something extraordinary (e.g. running up a mountain or reciting a Chinese poem) My answer ""chasch mi filme"" means that despite the other person's wish I am not doing it, because it would ask too much of me. 
It's a more or less funny way to tell someone to shut up.

			Potentially, a diploma can allways be of any help; it shows your comptences in a particular field.   
Now, it would be preferable if the one you mention would be focused on the European Language Portfolio; this system has got a normative value throughout EU both for educations institutions as for employers. In other words, it should document your competences according to the EU Language Portfolio. If not, I'd advise to choose another provider for your English course.

I created a site for me to manage my notes... you are really welcome to look at it as I update it daily and my focus is on Everyday German... that's practical! It's just new so not loads of content yet but maybe it helps you and keeps you updated while you can not afford to get to classes.   
Email me on   and I will send the link to you! I also found some brilliant links to youtube sites which are brilliant.   
I recommend buying ""German Grammar in a Nutshell"" as it's just a great foundation which covers pretty much everything.    
Good luck!

			Hi, I realise it might be a bit late and you might have managed to get in touch with the school by now... Anyway I took the CELTA at TeacherTraining in Milan last summer (June-July 2012) and never had any problems. Let me know if you're still trying to get in touch.

			if your English is fluent then there are some self-learning materials available that are not too bad (though not great), you can find some of them here:       
the online grammar tool is pretty good and not terribly expensive (I think less than CHF 50), although candidly all of the English-to-Swiss German materials I have come across are weak in their explanations of grammar.  the benefit with self-learning is that you can study and learn when your schedule permits.  the biggest hurdle with self-learning is finding an environment where Swiss German is spoken and where you can use the language enough to start building vocabulary (which is not too terribly steep a hurdle in Zurich but may be more so where you live).   
good luck!

			allemania does classes once a week on saturday mornings and is pretty cheap. the class sizes are large (8-12 but people start dropping out by the second month) and sometimes, they allow people to join even when the class is at the 4th lesson, which is pretty annoying.    
but i think this is probably one of the only schools in zurich doing once a week classes on saturday. unless you wanna spurge on private lessons, this is still a pretty good alternative

			Hi,   
We would like to find a motivated certified German language teacher who would come to our company (2-3 times/week) to give us lessons. We are 3 (possibly 4) adults at B1 level, very motivated and eager to learn and do our homework. We want to do this long-term and need someone who has their own company and can provide us with invoices for the classes.    
We prefer day-time classes but schedules can be arranged. We would like to start as soon as possible.   
Please PM at your earliest convenience.    
Thank you

			Dear All,   
Since last few months I am attending ELDIS German Language course organized by 
Stadt Zurich for Adult with children over 2 years of age. I really find this 
course very useful because this course doesn't only teach German language but it 
also gives lot of information about schooling in general in Switzerland. It is 
equivalent to A1 level but it costs much less than private German language 
courses (450 CHF for whole year and course is conducted twice a week in school 
days). New batch is starting from March 2013 and please feel free to check the link 
below to findout more info about the course and locations.       
Kind regards, 
shrineha

			Hello, 
I would like to practice german, russian and french if possible. I also like painting, so if someone is interested on that it would be nice to paint something together, to see how other people paint the same subject (mountains, sea...) I paint with acrylic as it seems easier than oil painting, but still have some difficulty trying to find the right color mix sometimes (I started painting a year ago). And of course if you would like to learn Spanish I would be happy to help you! 
Best regards, 
Jordi

1143	16.01.2008, 19:22	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 3 Times in 3 Posts	Location: Aarau	"    You are right when you say it will take a little longer, but since you are here, why waste the time learning at home? Go out and talk to the natives!   
I spent my first year in Munich doing what you are doing and being frustrated. It was only after I found opportunities to immerse myself did my german really start to improve. Head down to Zeughauskellar and talk to some locals; go down to the flea market on Saturday morning and chat to the folks running the stand; go to a local cafe and bug the people sitting there reading their papers... or whatever. The tip re the post-its is a good one, also, should you have a hobby, why not get together with like-minded folk in your area, I guarantee you they will be thrilled to have someone from abroad who shares their interests. My experience on this front came with a fellow old timer nut and a couple of fellow Oktoberfest freaks - we had things in common, they spoke no English and I wanted to learn German. And it works.    
Chatting on Englishforum may be fun but it will not improve your language skills. Sorry mods.    
I also recommend listening to German talk radio and ""reading"" German newspapers everyday... out loud if it does not feel too ridiculous. Half of your problem right now is being understood by the locals, any improvement in your pronunciation will really help you out.    
Last tip, be patient and do not worry about sounding like a total fool. Good luck!

			Hi,   
As I currently find myself unemployed - and given the trail of rejections in my wake, it would seem unemployable   - I am at home during the day.  Job hunting and making dinner for my OH are wearing very thin as activities go, so I'm wondering if there's any native German speaker in zone 10 of Zurich who is free one or two afternoons a week to meet up over a beer/coffee/orange juice (choose your poison) to talk German (or you can practice your English, and me my German) about just stuff - news, sports, opinions etc. Nothing too heavy, just a conversation exchange.   
I have a book full of vocab/verbs etc and can read German pretty well, but really need to get practising my spoken German.

			I think that most language courses in Zurich are quite expensive. I can highly recommend to take online classes over Skype. These are quite cheap, with native speakers all over the world and as it is one to one lessons you will have a lot of time to practice speaking. I have learned french and polish this way and have to say that I enjoyed it quite a bit. One of these portals is verbalplanet ( ). Just take a look at their webpage. They have a lot of teachers for german as well.

If you are still looking for someone to help with your English, feel free to send me a PM. 
Regards,

Eurocentre, Berlitz and Alemania, the 3 schools I have attended in Switzerland, all teach in the language you are studying.   
Although you are not expected to know anything, it can be frustrating that they speak to you as though you do.    
However, immersion teaching does seem to help the learning process even if it may not feel like it at the beginning.   
PS: Thank You for the heads-up on   and  . Nice to learn about some other language education opportunities!

			My daughter has attended LSI Zurich for 4 months.  She had no knowledge of German when she started.  She likes the school and we are pleased with the progress she has made.  Some of her teachers have been good and others have been better.   So far we can't say she's had a bad teacher (even the subs).   
Back in July, she started in a class already in progress.  At first she felt overwhelmed because everyone else seemed so much more advanced.  She stuck with it and eventually caught up (within ~5 weeks).  After about 12 weeks her class was combined with another class that was about one week ahead of hers.  She was apprehensive about it but, again, within a couple of weeks, students from both classes were at  the same level.  The teachers seem very capable at handling these transitions.   
Also, the school seems to be flexible in allowing you to move up/down a level if need be.     
She has made many friends.  The hardest part is saying goodbye to them when they start new jobs or return to their home countries.    
Based on our experience, I am happy to recommend the school.

			In my experience, you don't need it but if you're planning to stay long term it's good to try and adapt it.    
There are a LOT of Germans in Zurich (at least in the city) and quite a few foreigners (or Swiss French and Swiss Italians) as well (students and others).    
It's quite common to communicate in Hochdeutsch in Zürich, especially if you're foreign. Once you've been around for a while and your Hochdeutsch is good, perhaps you could try communicating in the dialect.    
I don't think it's too hard to pick up, especially if you're immerged in a Swiss German speaking environment.

			Seems to be a standardized card that is used to register in equestrian competitions. They come in three flavor: dressage, jumping, and driving. You can order them with   Registration may also be possible  .   
I assume that they will not only have space for the registration but also for the event results and thus can be easily used for book, score, and whatever keeping. As they are standardized everybody working at such competitions will know what information can be found on this card and where on has to fill in the score. Smart.   
Seems like you could replace ""Nenn-"" or ""Nennung"" with Registration 
Nennstartkarte - Start registration card 
Nennsystem - Registration system 
Nenngeld - Registration fee 
Nennschluss - Registration deadline 
Nachnennung - Late registration (at competition) 
Nachnenngebühr - Nachnenngeld - Late registration fee   
This terms may also be used for other sport competitions, such as street races, Marathons, Ski competitions etc.

1204	07.10.2012, 12:55	Senior Member	Thanked 166 Times in 69 Posts	Location: Canton Zurich	"    I buy my lessons in packages of twelve 60-minute slots for 92  CHF an hour. Once you become a repeat client, you get 8% off. You can  decide if you want to do 45-minute or whatever suits you in length, but  once your 720 minutes are up, then you buy a new package. Once you're in  exam preparation mode, it jumps to 105 CHF an hour. But that usually is  only 4-5 weeks before the exam that you're in that mode.   
I'd say  I worked with my teacher once a week most of the time, but for a few  months it was twice a week. Right before my C1 exam, I was SUPER nervous  and met with her 3-4 times a week. But I still don't think there's any  group course I could have taken to get me from B1 to C1 in 12 months  when I add up how much I paid.   
Good luck!      Ha, that made me laugh! Thanks! The information you provided is really helpful. There's absolutely no way that I could interview in French right now, but there was a time when I in fact lived and functioned in French speaking families during my study abroads. The language is somewhere there still...I hope...

It's not an obsession but the result of a necessitiy caused by another obsession of mine, namely model railroad building, where those thin plastic sheets can serve many purposes.    
As you may imagine, they all have 12 or 15 rectangles, one for each month of the year plus sometimes three more for the last months of the previous year or the first months of the next year. Each month square has five (February sometimes only four) lines, one for each week.    
Without a single exception, they all have Monday as the first day of the week, no matter how far back I go.    
By the way, in the 1950s, we had a silly joke. We asked a class mate, ""Do you know what 'Modimidofrsaso' means?"" Of course no one knew. ""What, you don't know? Are you blind or what? You've seen it so many times!"" Take your pocket calender out of the wallet and show them, ""Mo Di Mi Do Fr Sa So"" (for  ntag,  enstag,  ttwoch"" etc.. Duh.

Fachfrau/mann Betreuung 
Pflegeassistent/in

If you go there, you'll be seeing every habitant of the valley. It's very ""champester"" (no idea how to say that in English: ländlich). Ask people at the Chasa cumünala for baby sitting. In these small places, the information is not written down anywhere, everybody just knows or knows who knows. Even if you can't go the whole day, go there are speak to the coordinator (It used to be Mario Pult, no idea whether he is still there), he will be able to help you to get language coaching or courses or something. It's Romansh country, personal contact is everything, forget the formality of the northern Alp-side.

For me I just get too confused if I try and directly translate an English sentence to German, plus the grammar is completely different and it just won't make sense.  This happens to me alot when I have been speaking English for sometime and then must switch to German, I end up directly translating from English at first and my German sounds really funny as I use English grammar.  I find it best to seperate the 2 lanaguges clearly and only translate words not sentences.

The problem with this though is this is my translation of something that may well have another, quite different, official translation. As such, they may have difficulty understanding what you mean.

			We've lived in Geneva for almost a year and both our girls go to the public school. They are native english speaking and speak polish fluently.   
My 9 year old can understand, read and write French but her standard is not satisfying the school who expect more competence after almost 1 year.    
She actually knows plenty, but is hesitant to take risks and make mistakes and doesn't yet connect learned vocabulary into sentences and have conversations.   
This is making it difficult for her to keep up with other subjects, particularly maths.   
I'd like a recommendation, from personal experience for an empathetic tutor in Geneva, to work with her on 1:1 to improve her confidence with spoken french, focus her maths learning and help her catch up with the class.   
My preference is a tutor familiar with the Geneva public education system and curriculum.   
Thank you.

			That is good to know.   
I've been quite impressed with the folks at Swissing.  I've met with Susanna Iglesia (who is wonderful and speaks Spanish, English, French and German).  I also had a class with Tiziana.  I thought she was wonderful.   
Bella Lingua seems good, but ultimately I think that they wanted too much money up front.  They wouldn't even give a trial lesson.  But Swissing was very accommodating and let me have a free group lesson and a free private lesson.  I was most impressed.

			Hi everyone, (Mods - I am not sure if I have posted this in the right section, please move if necessary - many thanks!)   
In addition to my High German and Swiss German language lessons, I would like to start a book group for those at a C1-C2 level.   
We would read a mixture of literature in a broad range of genres, written by well-known (as well as less well-known) German, Swiss and Austrian authors.     
The book group meetings would take place at my home office/classroom in Wädenswil.  Alternatively, we could take it in turns and each member of the group could host a meeting at their place - I am flexible in this regard.   
If you are interested in more information, please send me a PM.  I look forward to hearing from you!   
Cheers, 
Lianne

			The best thing to do would be an intensive German course, full immersion is the way to go and they teach you the grammar which are super important for understanding in German. 
There are some good apps out there for learning German and some really terrible ones. I've tried a heap of them and the biggest recommendation I can make for someone who is just beginning is the Michel Thomas Method (you will see him recommended in other threads). They have made an app for his program, which is expensive but hardly the cost of buying the CDs. The app is Iphone built but it's all audio so the larger layout is not required. It gives you a heap of confidence in speaking fast.  
For a tap and play Ipad app Busuu works well but they are always trying to get more money out of you. I would highly recommend 'German Flash Cards' by Declan Software. Absolutely awesome as it has phased repetition and a bunch of other tricks to make it stick. Get it it's worth it. Avoid 'word power' or 'word bots' they are terrible. The only thing with app programs is they usually give you words, German needs grammar for understanding and learning this alone can be painful. In a class it can actually be fun!

			I was wondering if anyone has ever done the german course which the Swiss Unemployment office put you on in Basel. I am starting it on Monday, it's an intensive 5 day, 20 hour a week course lasting for 3 months being run by the K5 school on Gundelingerstrasse. I have heard some things about it but not much, does anyone know if it is a good quality course and what to expect from it?   
I am going to be giving it 100% as I really do want to learn the language so with that in mind do you think it would be possible for someone to get from a low A1 to a B1 standard and take the  Goethe-Zertifikats B1: Zertifikat Deutsch (ZD) in that 3 months?

1286	08.07.2012, 00:40	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: USA	"    I'm actually a student at uni who has studied German for 2yrs and would like to take a language intensive course while visiting friends in Bern for a month. I'm paying myself.   
Berlitz looks really good, but do you know if there are an intensive (i.e. daily) courses that can be taken on a flexible schedule?        That is very true, and some truly amazing advice,  !    
My only concern about Migros is that I heard it does move at a slower pace, and I'm looking for a program that will really push me since I won't be there long and want to strengthen my speech (hopefully, lol). I will, however, definitely get in touch with the school to learn about their programs and options!

			Hi all,   
We currently live in Neuchatel and are moving to Zug at the end of July.     
In Neuchatel, Ive been attending French classes at an organization for women called Recif.  Its brilliant!  Basically, whilst I have a French class, my toddler goes to a supervised crèche/playgroup run by the same organization (and its in the same building).  Its a great way for me to meet other people and for both me and my son to practice French.   
So, my question is does a similar organization offering German lessons exist in or near Zug?  And/or does the Canton of Zug offer integration courses with daycare?   
Hoping someone can help!   
Thanks in advance xx

			I enrolled for the summer school at the University of Geneva many years ago and it was the best course for me to improve my French.   
First they test everyone to provide the right level.  The course is fairly intensive and includes lectures/teaching of grammar etc., language lab to improve pronunciation and some fun add-ons   
Most students are young; between 18 and 24   
I know you mentioned the price may be an issue, but I highly recommend it as for me it was worth what I paid at the time.

If you are still looking for a solution, I can offer intensive private French tuitions during the week ends.  
I am a UK qualified and experienced native French teacher. I teach French in British schools, such as St Georges in Clarens and gives private tuitions to individuals and business.

Caribou is not just the reindeer like animal in Northern Québec, it is also something consumed at carnival. Typically a blend of red wine and spirits. After a few shots it does not feel so cold outside.    
By the way the accent is not funny or strange, it is just traditional old Norman and Breton French, unsullied by the Paris intellectuals who changed fin de semaine to ""week-end"" and stationment to ""parking"".    
Of course there are always a few good natured misunderstandings, such as ""Ne touche pas à ma blonde"" Which a Belgian would interpret as ""don't touch my beer"" and the Québecois knows is ""leave my girlfriend alone"".

			I'm not a translator...   
But I am a native English speaker and I think that passage needs some work to improve the quality of the English before you start translating it into French.    
For starters, what is it supposed to be? An advert, a mission statement, or a 'what we believe' statement? To be honest I can't decide if the passage is supposed to be chatty or formal in tone - it is an uncomfortable mix of the two. Your sentences are too long, poorly structured and some of them don't make a great deal of sense.   
If you want help, I suggest you provide more information about what you are trying to say, what your target audience is, and what the context is. Then perhaps someone will be able to help you get that paragraph into a paragrapher that is decently-structured, grammatically correct, and that contains vocabulary that is appropriate for your aim and audience.    
You might also consider updating your profile to be a little more specific. I am not inclined to help someone who cannot decide if they are a 'business student', a 'business man' or a 'business owner'. Why? Because I prefer to help people who are upfront about who they are, what they need help with and why they need it. I am under the impression that most of the posters on here feel the same way. If you come back and explain a little more, I'd be happy to try and get your English into better shape. And then perhaps someone might help with the French.

			Hey, 
it might be an idea to say what is your mother tongue. As most people will be interested in learning a language from a native speaker. Also you should consider that offering to teach someone English when you are not able to speak perfectly might not be a good idea.  
Sorry to say but you have a few grammer and spelling mistakes in your post.

			The class I have been attending is facing closure as we only have three students and we have been told we need at least one more person to continue it.   
We are currently three ladies with a female teacher and are at about top A1/low A2 level.   
The class is run at the Eltern Kind Zentrum in Stäfa and was planned to take place at 0830 to 1000 on a Friday morning (not including local school holidays).  The ELKI has childcare during lesson times if required which is on site.   
Course cost is roughly 260CHF per semester, plus childcare at 5CHF per time per child.   
If you are interested and would like the contact details of the lady in charge or more details, please send me a PM.

Three little girls talk about where babies come from. The German girls say, ""In our cantry, babies are brought by ze stork."" The French girl says, ""As far as I knoh, in Fronce it has somesing to do wiz erotticke."" And the Swiss girl says, ""In Switzerland, zat differs from Kanton to Kanton.""

And for that, I suppose you'd need to mirror writers with styles you'd like to emulate. Perhaps someone somewhere has written a program to emulate a writing style. It's probably easier to have another reader.

			Hello, 
   I  want to start studying french in Montreux or Vevey Area.  I am looking for a class of 5-20 students.  I have been studying on my own since January, so I am probably an experienced beginner.  Looking to find a place that is fairly reasonable for 1-3 months of study. Also interested in 4 hours a day of study.   Anyone have any good advice or ideas?     
Thanks for the help.

			I second that, they are crafty: the schools in each city were separate companies, he just immediately closed the companies that were not making a profit.    
Maybe a reasonable action for him, but many employees had to sue him to get their wages paid, while the other cities were making enough money. Why couldn't he give formal notice and pay his employees?    
So I would only pay him on a daily basis, in case the school went bankrupt before the next lesson.

			I agree with Stifoan. The Cambrige Proficiency proves you can express yourself in English - but this does not mean you can translate well.    
A learner with a vocabulary of 2000 words can understand 96% of spoken words but only 80% of average written text. A learner with 6000 words understands 90%. However, using them correctly in context is far more difficult. Like asking an equestrian to ride a tiger.    
From Wikipedia, a 1995  study estimated the vocabulary size of first-year college students (high-school educated) at about 12,000, and college-educated speakers at  about 17,000 word families.   
With the help of a dictionary you can be more precise, but only a native speaker can choose easily between close synonyms. ""A Swiss with CPE would be quite good  at translating from English into German, but not necessarily the other  way around."" I'm an English teacher, but no matter how long I learn German, I will always be very wary of translating into it.   
Check your vocabulary on

Thanks for the pointer on schools.  I may still try Goethe, and stay at the hostel there. 
Also the Alphasprachstudio web page was not working, but when I googled the school name I was pointed to the Equal web page listing partner schools that meet their teacher qualifying criteria.   
Any other pointers are greatly appreciated!!

			I am neither a hiker nor a climber...   
But I do live in Swiss Romande... and it seems to me I've heard that word used to refer to energetic babies or toddlers who are scaling the sofa!   I'm not sure where that leaves you...   
Word reference, which I generally use when in doubt, translates it as 'rock climber'. See  .   
Hopefully someone who actually does the sport will come along soon and help you...   
But I can confirm it is used in Swiss Romande to refer to a climber in a very general sense, at the very least!

			Okay I am going to attempt to post this one more time, since the last two wouldn't post.  Where to start......my name is Tyra and I am in the U.S.  I found this forum due to teasing from a friend.  He would say things to me in what I now lovingly refer to as swissy (Berndeutsch).  He would taunt me with the fact that there was no translator online that could tell me what he was saying.  Well he was wrong........I found all of you here.  lol.  He even gave me the old chuchichaschtli test!  He and I have become rather close in the months that have passed since this has all started.  He is an amazing man.  He calls me Sweetness and his Sunshine, he has told me macht das dsunne schint.  I make his sun shine.  I wanted to impress him so I'd ask for some translations and how to say certain things on this forum.  Unfortunately he has been right though, I don't have many resources.   
I read your thread about the resources for learning swiss german and some of it has proved to be helpful, but very little.  Most of the listed resources are in German then going to Swiss German or they are not the dialect I am looking for.  I also saw your post about tandem language partners but most people are in Switzerland for that.  I am here in the U.S.  There are no classes here and not much in resources to learn Swiss German in general let alone Berndeutsch.  I want to be able to talk to this man in his beautiful language not mine.  Sorry for the long winded explanation.  I guess what I am getting at.... is I am asking if someone on here could help a little american girl learn some real Swiss German (preferrably Berndeutsch).  I am fully aware that learning another language does not happen over night.  If someone on here invested their time in teaching me I promise you I will not waste it.  Any help would be much appreciated, more than you'll ever know.  I will be in debt to you.

1344	15.04.2012, 17:25	Newbie	Thanked 3 Times in 2 Posts	Location: Hoenggerberg	"    I would recommend Hull's School (at Stadelhofen) or AKAD (in Oerlikon). I did my Lower Cambridge with Hull and my Proficiency with AKAD. Both were great decades ago, and apparently have improved. Migros is tremendous for private correspondence and holiday trips. Mum was at Migros School learning English between 1972 and 2001 and found it splendid. But for university you need the proficiency, and this is quite a different thing. You will get lectured by Cambridge educated teachers, who may be humourous but mean serious business. It is not easy work to get the Proficiency Certificate but you learn a lot, not just about English but even about how to teach other people in a senseful way, about English culture, about how to behave in the English speaking world, about business, and more. A lot of work but worth any minute.    
From Hönggerberg, AKAD may be nearer, the question however is where you work. And S-Bahn trains from Hardbrücke to Stadelhofen need less than 10 minutes. So that both options are open. Locationwise, my preference would be Hull

When I had to do the same , the Swiss embassy in Dublin had special preprinted forms for this - they just filled them in from the Irish ones, put a nice big stamp on them and that was that.

			My wife is attending a German course provided by Gemeinde Zollikon, in Zollikerberg.   
She had her first lesson, and at the moment there are only 3 students, and unless 2 more people join they will close the course.   
The teacher seems really good, and the price is great for such a small class.   
The lessons are every Thursday, 9am till 11am and due to bank holiday the next lesson (the second lesson, you havent missed much) will be on May 24th.    
The course runs until 5th July, stops for the summer break and restarts on 23rd August until 27th September.   
If you would like to enroll please call 00 41 391 73 72 (Gemeinde Zollikon) or if you have any more questions let me know.

			Hi Everyone,   
I'm looking for summer German or Swiss German language courses in the Basel area. Any recommendations? I will be staying from around the 25th of May to the 15 of August, so I would like something that would fit in that time frame.   
Now, a lot of people have told me   to go to Switzerland to learn german, but I have a good reason I swear! I'm a young Swiss-American college student who, because of various circumstances, never learned Swiss German from my Swiss parent. However, I started taking German this year, and I really enjoy speaking it (go figure), and I would like to be able to use the opportunities that my dual nationality opens up for me.   
Also, some type of summer job/way to earn some pocket money would't be a bad thing, so any suggestions on that front would be helpful as well. Because of my other languages, is working in a hostel or being a tour guide feasible? Any music related suggestions (I play violin)?   
Thanks for your help!

As you know ""intensive course"", so I think it is not so fast, like me, I am learning intensive German in Migros Klubschule, to finish Level A1 (means A1/1 and A1/2) and A2 (A2/1 + A2/2), we need 4 months. Personally, I think it is better when we shtudy in a normal course, 2 or 3 days a weeks, so that we have a more time to review in details. Studying in intensive course, I often skip many new words or some Grammar.

			Hello,   
My husband and me are learning German but unfortunately not having the chance to practice. I mean: learning a lot of grammar in School (A2-B1 level) but not able to have a conversation.  
We are both Spanish. We think it will be nice if we can find someone interested in practice Spanish and willing to teach us some German (you need to be patient, hehe).   
Joining ones a week some where else for a drink in or near Olten sounds good for us.    
Anyone interested?????

			Thank you for your help everyone - and sorry for the delay in replying - I have been reading your replies but have been struggling to keep on top of tasks this week!   
Interestingly several people seem to struggle to understand what I mean by breath hitching. Perhaps it is not a common phrase. Or perhaps I'm loosing my English...   
To try and clarify, the best explanation I can give is that I I use the phrase 'hitching' to describe a sensation I often experience which is very similar to a series of gentle hiccups in my chest - without the 'hic'! So my breath comes short, slightly faster than usual and in an irregular pattern. But it is not due to overexertion, anxiety or being upset - hence why I want to avoid saying my breath is catching in my chest which for me (in English) implies a more obvious breathing problem generally linked to an physical or emotional cause.    
(As an aside, if you really want to refine your English and French vocabulary in the areas of emotions and physical sensations, a 20 week CBT group will provide an excellent training... and if you do 3 such groups, you will find yourself pondering minute details of vocabulary as described above on a regular basis)!    
I think that the 'chatouiller' suggestion might be best, as to me that sounds the least dramatic! Or someone offline suggested I simply said 'J'ai la respiration irregulière'.    
Thank you again - for nothing else, for demonstrating to me once again that we all identify and describe our physical sensations in different ways.    
Now to go and do tonight's exercises!

			Hi everybody,   
I am new here but actually I have been in zurich for a while.  After a period for my work now I decide to start learning German, although it's not really necessary for working but it feels really good when I buy something in Supermarket or just on bus...    
I come from China and learned for 6 months in China, now I want to find a German speaking study buddy who happens to have some interest in learning Chinese. Then we can teach each other~~   
Hope to find someone here. PM me if you are interested and we can discuss details like schedule later.   
Best,

			Yeah, my ex-wife got an earful in Fribourg when she asked at a kiosk for a coke! But as she spoke no French it had no effect on her, but she always thought the Romandie people were very rude to her, ha ha, they would be if you go about asking for hard drugs!    
In Germany I learnt that a Schoppe was an old European one pint measure, hence the festival ""Frühschoppen"" when they start drinking at 10 am.   
For a milky coffee ask for a ""Renversé"" (Spelling ??) when they put more milk in first before the coffee.    
A friend of mine taught me that the part of Geneva known as Gex is pronounced Gay. And how do they pronounce sex, is it ""say""?

			I attend ECAP Winterthur (there's one in Zurich also) and so far, I like the experience. The teachers are energetic and compassionate, and it is the least expensive intensive course I've found. (3 hours class time per day, 5 days a week.)  
AND, it seems like EVERYONE in my class is on RAV(except me).  So, it's worth a check. 
Good Luck!   
Oh, and it's my understanding that RAV will only get you through A1.(3 months)

			My kids, 17 and 20, (who are french) love the site ""vie de merde"" - lots of little snippets of how life trips you up, usually ending with the predictable punchline.   
Canard enchainé is pretty advanced french. It is the french equivalent of the british ""Private Eye"", but with better investigative journalism, IMHO. Great if you are interested in french politics and scandals, but not much fun if you're not. The fake column by our nearly-ex-President's wife is a good laugh.

1390	05.06.2009, 03:45	Junior Member	Thanked 131 Times in 11 Posts	Location: Wetzikon, Zürich	"    Absolutely not! We love it when you try our language, no matter how bad your pronunciation is. And most Swiss are really happy to hear something nice about our language, or even see people trying to learn it, boosts our self-confidence a bit.   We don't really like it getting compared to German too much, or hearing that it sounds similar. So if you want to say something nice just say it sounds a bit similar to Dutch, something the Dutch themselves would agree to as well. Have never witnessed any bad reaction from Swiss when exposed to foreigners trying to speak Swiss German, and I interact with quite a lot of foreigners on a daily basis in both work and private life. Be prepared to be made fun of though, and don't take it to heart, it just really sounds funny/lovely to us.  
It seems like most Swiss really have a huge deficit when it comes to speaking about their language, so chances are you'll get an hour-long lecture about the differences in dialects and how this and that canton speaks a nice/ugly accent.

I don't know where exactly you come from, but if it is the Kanton of Zurich, I recommend the highschool I attend:   
They have courses from A2-C2+. Since we are a school of Linguistics, Translation, etc. we have highly competent teachers and equipment. You can also take the Goethe examinations here.

			Heres another: you can follow several different conversations in several languages simultaneously  among guests dining at tables around you without translating. You simply know what they said and its understood. You don't even think: you just understand. However, if you think its getting worse, its actually good, because you are out of your comfort zone and improving. You can never be good enough!

(Make sure to find someone who has a degree in teaching German 
as a second language).    
Majority of the listings of the tutors are in Germany, which one 
can work via Skype. The advantage is the hourly wage rates in 
Germany are significantly lower. And you can learn via Skype!

1414	12.11.2011, 09:57	Junior Member	Thanked 9 Times in 8 Posts	Location: Zug	"    Few people learn languages ""automatically"" and to learn another language if done thoroughly IS work. I have taken up a paid assignment as a private German teacher once per week. The student is a Latin American lady who came to CH 8 years ago and has a 6 years old son who speaks  fluently Swiss German but of course not yet Standard German. When being there I throughout the hour strictly keep to Standard German, and try to bring a bit of grammar and structure into her German language mess. She does not lack intelligence at all, but I strongly suspect that she never learnt proper Spanish grammar either. Another aspect to be cared about is prononciation(s) and regional variations.    
I have done such teachings for apprentices in our company in the 80ies in German, French and English.  The problem was that they, majority-wise of Italian origin, spoke Swiss German perfectly well and were better in French in a general way then their native Swiss colleagues, but missed structures, grammar and spelling. Critical was the situation with English, as in aircargo your professional (legally binding) language IS English, and not just a ""bla-bla Swinglish English"" but a correct one. Things did not arrive with those teachers of the Commercial School of KV-Z really well, so that action was needed.    
My grandfather (mother-side) language-wise was good but a bit the ""victim"" of his father (my grand-grandfather) who had lived for roughly a decade in the USA, but had returned in the late 1870ies and married. AND demanded of his son fairly early to learn properly English, which was not excactly easy at the time. He then had to ride by train to Zürich in the evening twice per week and when needing more of it on one side in the 1920ies bought some of the earliest ""audio"" things available, and had one radio tuned on the BBC and listened to BBC broadcasts and to speeches of people like Lloyd George, Ramsay McDonald, and Neville Chamberlain. He by some self-courses also learnt Italian, and so was the correspondent in his company for English, French and Italian. He improved his linguistic proficiencies by meeting Englishmen, Frenchmen and Italians while on holidays in the Alps, sitting together with them until midnight.    
He of course heavily encouraged the enthusiasm of his daughter for other languages    "	made some interesting contributions	Join Date: Nov 2011	Groaned at 2 Times in 1 Post	Rosetta Stone	smtrickett	Posts: 79	4,399	25	Language corner

The   speaking immigrants, called  , from the Valais settled in many pretty isolated areas that were avoided by the original inhabitants of the Grisons. Examples are the   and adjacent valley, and the Prättigau, which is almost entirely  .   can be found even in Austrian Vorarlberg too (  and  ). The mountain settlements in Southern St. Gallen and partly also in Glarus were founded by   settlers too.    
In the Chur area, there are   pockets all over the place, which, of course, caused a blend of the languages in the course of many centuries.

""How many people in Switzerland can   English?""   
The stats quoted are for ""  a language"" ... (which I paraphrase as ""they think they can speak"" or ""they have taken a few years in school"") ... now that can be quite different from actually speaking a language, as I have discovered here at work.

			When I was learing German in college, I had one teachter from Austria who played us a tape of what Swiss-German sounded like. There's no way you can even learn it without being there. The best you can do is learn southern German, like Austrian or Bavarian. For some reason it's also hard to find a German teacher in the schools around the world who happens to be from Switzerland. The closest thing you can do to learning Switzerland's languages before living there is to learn German from Austrians and to learn French from Belgians. Or Italian from people from Northern Italy. Those are the places people have to be from before they'll bother to remember to tell you, ""Oh by the way, this is what Switzerland says..."" or ""this is how it's done in Switzerland...""    
The best I was able to do was get out the Austrian that Switzerland always uses the ss instead of that symbol that HochDeutsch uses (I don't even have it on this keyboard) and says Sonnabend like Austria instead of Samstag. On the French side, the best I could get was that they use the original-Latin words for seventy and ninety like Belgium (septante and nonante) instead of saying ""sixty-ten"" and ""four-twenty-ten"" like France. This far I got from learning French from Belgians.    
The countries around it whose languages it shares, all seem to treat it like it's not even there, or that its ""variation"" of the language in question is somehow ""not correct."" I had a German teacher from Berlin who seemed not to even remember that Switzerland is even THERE, somehow. I'm in Quebec now, so don't get me started on how the French treat Switzerland regarding their shared language...!

1435	09.02.2012, 12:22	Senior Member	Thanked 403 Times in 182 Posts	Location: Birmensdorf ZH, ex-Lausanne	"    I right now give German lessons to a lady from Latin America, who does not hesitate to speak in German, but whose grammar and structure in German was a bit of a mess, and so, I concentrated my efforts on grammar. Many German teachers, even North Germans, however have a meagre command of grammar and so rather avoid than tackle grammar which is widely regarded as boring, while it is the skeleton of a language. I do not believe that there are any schools with ""Deutsche Grammatik"" classes, while there are teachers who give more or less emphasis to grammar.   
What you mention about your talking problem in fact obviously is a mental and psychological problem. You possibly when going to such places like those lessons should relax more and take it easier. I in secondary class had a teacher who, under a bit ""shady"" pretenses on specific days picked on me and ""condemned"" me to an ""extra-hour"" after 4pm. It was his Italian lesson, he gave me some nice stuff to work on, which I even could take home with me. And then, as he knew that I from holidays had quite some command in practical Italian, when those students got ""stucked"" suddenly asked me  ""how would YOU say it"" and I then replied ""well, simply  ........""  .  And I took the most simple way possible.  Which, as Dr.Dr. R.M. stated, was THE way to go. So, back again, relax and take it easy.  Do not try to be perfect, but try to communicate. Do not feel frustrated when/if the teacher corrects you.

			It depends your present level. I believe in vocabulary in context, not in word lists. But that might be just me.   
I would claim that 20 Minuten read every morning with revision twice later in the day and vocab. logg cards of some kind is a good way to go for more than just the basics and for adding a bit of sophistication to your colloquial basic German.

			It seems  strange to me, that the term ""lotrecht"" is used in the context of maths (where normally ""rechtwinklig"" or ""orthogonal"" would be used).   
A ""Lot"" is a tool which is mostly used to determine wheter a wall is pependicular to the ground or not. In its simplest form it is just a string which a weight attached. ""Lotrecht"" litterally means the direction into which the Lot is pointing (i.e. the direction of gravity.) 
According to wikipedia the corresponding English term is vertical direction.    
It seems though that in Geometry the therm Lot is used (altougth I never heard it in this context before). In which case it just means a line which is perpendicular to an other line.   
The term Senkrecht is a bit ambigious it is actually synonymos to ""Lotrecht"" (it derived from the word ""Senkblei"" which is onother word for ""Lot"") and means the vertical direction.   it is on the same time often used to express that two lines are perpendicular to each other (here ""rechtwinklig"" or ""orthogonal"" would be better choices). It seems as if the teacher did not pick the best termology.

			Thank you all for your responses, it is reassuring to know that many people have been in the same situation as we will be and have positive experiences to speak of.    
I did have to smile when reading the comments regarding 'Dragon Parenting', I hadn't realised what an emotive issue this can be. Since we will probably be in Switzerland for the long haul, I just wanted my daughter to be able to make some friends and to hopefully learn some of the language before she starts kindergarten. I would also like to help her French as none of her French family speak English and as I mentioned in the original post, she is reluctant to speak it. Also, what I didn't say was perhaps more selfishly, one of the main reasons for seeking local playgroups is for me to meet other parents as moving abroad with small children (I also have a 9 week old) is a very scary prospect, and one that many of you have been through!

			I'm at ECAP - just behind HB and they're quite good. Both teachers I've had so far have encouraged discussion. I think they also have an office in Oerlikon (check ecap.ch)   
Have you thought about joining one of the many German-speaking groups which are advertised around here?

			Hi There,   
Started a search on the German teaching schools in Switzerland, came across many.    
Any suggestions as to which one is good, I stand at level B1, and want to start with Middle level (Mittelstufe B2).    
My preference is more conversation than reading from the book chapter after chapter, looking for some interactive course setup esp. designed for professionals or something. Any suggestions?   
Thanks in advance.

			There's ECAP. 330Fr for 40 hrs IIRC.    
Twice a week, 2 lessons per session. So 4 lessons a week.    
I don't think spending more hours for classes would help much if you have gone over the threshold. There's only so much you could possibly learn. The key here is to use the lingo everyday.

			Just to follow up on this, my daughter did attend the ESL Zug summer school in August 2011 and found it really good. They do formal German classes in the morning, and then do outings/activities later in the afternoon. She really enjoyed meeting people from all over the world. And the location, near the lake and old town, is just gorgeous. She's now back at school in the UK and the whole experience has boosted her confidence considerably, and not just in German...

There are many kinds of written Swiss German - its existance is not questioned, the Bücher Brocky will show you nice examples of it. However, the authors just write it like they want, and that is not always that easy to follow. Each author demands a certain training, or even just to read it loud. Not standardized, with all the inconvinients of that situation and the taste of authenticity at the same time. One likes it or not, that´s a question of taste.

			I did the intensive, month-long CELTA several years ago. The biggest challenge for us was cramming all the prep and assignments into those 4 weeks - with theory in the mornings, that often meant CELTA-ing 14 hours a day. Hopefully you won't suffer the same pressure with the 3 month one!   
Overall though, a brilliant learning experience, and my biggest worry - having your fellow students and tutor observing /critiquing - was soon forgotten. I learnt masses, despite having years of observation/teaching experience to begin with (as a Teaching Assistant).   
I didn't completely agree with the marking scheme - e.g. rapport was one box to tick, but given equal value to every other box - e.g. presentation of materials. That meant that a guy in our group, with zero connection to any of the students and whose class everyone dreaded, got the second highest grade, having ticked enough boxes in other categories. But.. that's a minor gripe!   
The very detailed tutor report at the end is really useful. Just don't lose your certificate. I've heard they are irreplaceable.    
Good luck

			Bündnerdeutsch was the first Swiss dialect I learned. I was in a Rumantsch speaking area but people spoke S/German to me. I later moved to Bern-land for nearly 4 years, then on to Zürich. I learned high German from reading and television.   
School wouldn't have worked for me because I have difficulties learning in a theoretical way. I have to do and experience things. I'm sure if I moved to a  German city I would speak good German in a short time by absorbing the language around me.   
If your a theoretical learner then I would advise a good German course, for the rest I'd get out and about and communicate as much as possible with those around you, it's not difficult to keep both separate.

			Maybe it was the title of your post which makes it confusing. On here, with the exception of the Tandem Thread, Language Corner is devoted to matters concering the  languages used (officially) in Switzerland. German, French, Italian and Romansch. Other language classes etc. are considered Off-Topic as they have nothing to do with general living in Switzerland.   
I appreciate that this all sounds very complicated. Just stick around and you'll get the idea. Hope you meet up with some new friends soon.

If you are here with a job (or with someone who has a job), and therefore have an income, then I doubt very much you will get something for free. I would imagine the same thing applies if you are a student.    
If you are out of work, then you   be entitled to a free language course (talk to your ORP advisor or social worker).    
If you are on a low income, or in a 'precarious situation', and are not able to benefit from other French classes, you may be able to get help from these people:  . The classes are not free, but they are very cheap.    
If none of these options apply / appeal, you could post a request for a langauge exchange on  . I think that you might also be able to find someone studying at UNIL or EPFL for a language exchange... A friend of mine did this (and ended up marrying her language exchange partner, but that's another story). I don't know exactly where she found the ad though, sorry.    
Hope that helps.

			I just asked my husband, who is a primary school teacher. He said it takes a lot of practice, regardless, even if the child does not have dyslexia, so try to make it fun and don't get too stressed about it.   
I know at my preschool/primary school they had a plastic clock with moveable hands, and a clock stamp where you could make the clock face and then draw on the hands to whatever you wanted, and name them.   
When making the switch from English to German, they say 'half to' the hour whereas we say 'half past' - so 'halb 2' is 13:30. One of the first things my husband did as a new english teacher for the primary schoolers was to make sure they could all tell the time and say the time in english properly... because it's pretty confusing.

			We own   I found it to be a useful resource and read it before the birth of our first.   
We choose to operate as a OPOL (One Parent, One Language) household. No matter where we live or where we are, I speak exclusively in English with our children and my husband speaks exclusively in Swiss German. As a matter of politeness, when guests are at the table with us, we speak predominantly in the least common denominator language. However, when telling my daughter to, ""sit down properly"" or other manners things, I'll still speak to her in English.   
Before we moved to Switzerland when she was just shy of 2.5, she was fluent with her understanding, but spoke back almost always in English. Personally, I wanted my husband to push her more to speak back, but he didn't think it was necessary and her Swiss German is not under my control.   
When we moved here, it took about six weeks before she was fluent in both speaking and listening. The real turning point was when we went on a week long vacation with another Swiss German family. The intensity of that experience really helped her spoken language blossom.   
Then in October, we went back to the US and it worked the same way in reverse. The intensity of two weeks in an English speaking environment resulted in yet another language explosion in English.   
My daughter has always been extremely very verbal in English and she began early. I found that as she started speaking more and more Swiss German, she followed the same path in regards to the extent of her vocabulary and ways that she uses it.

I have put a lot of thought into how to do bilingualism in my household and have considered a lot of methods. I always ask other bilingual families how they do it and bilingual adults what they did and didn't like about the experience growing up. I've come to the conclusion that there are many, MANY ways to raise bilingual children. You have to figure out what makes most sense for YOUR family. It also very much depends on the child. My daughter loves to talk and loves to express herself. I am not at all shocked by her fluency and how long it took. It's just the way she is. Other children are shy or some don't want to say a word until they know it's perfect. What works for one, may not work or simply may not make sense for your family. In the book that I linked above, there are many examples as well.   
*****   
Direct to your question, I once read on the forum about a family who introduced a doll to their child during bathtime or something like this. This doll could only understand Swiss German. Apparently this was a non-threatening way for the child to practice and during a limited period of time so it wasn't overwhelming. I liked that idea and have put it in my toolbox if I ever need it.   
Hope that helps!

			when I was in language school back in the dark ages of the late 20th century, we practiced routinely to speak ""about myself"".     
We started first by writing our little biography, starting with where we were born, where we grew up, went to school, something about our families, hobbies, interests, and plans for the future.    
Once you have it all written out, you can go through and edit it for content, grammar and structure.    
Then you basically just memorize it.

			I tried the Babbel.com website last night. I was hoping to find something good for practicing sentence structure, however, it seems like they just have you attempt writing a text and then you can send to others to be evaluated. Not very impressive.    
The vocabulary exercises seem very good. You start off slowly and then build up to the full spelling of the word. I was hoping they might have something like that for sentences, especially to help with word order.

			Although my experience has only been on the French side I can certainly empathize.    
For the last 11 years I have been visiting my Wife's family in Valais on Holidays, Christmas etc staying with them for anything up to 10 days. It has been quite painful at times. Since none of her family spoke any English.    
Since these were brief visits I didn't make a big enough effort to learn French. I did take some evening classes however living and working in England meant I had very little use / practice for it. My Wife still blames herself for not teaching me and now we don't get the time with a 2 year old running around.    
Now also we have moved to Switzerland she's worried she'll start losing her English so wants to speak English at home. I'll be going off to more French classes in Late September, so for now it's back to the books / cd's / Television.

			Hello,    
I am an English teacher/native speaker living in Luzern. I am currently learning Italian (know the basics) and German (I start lessons next week) so I would love to chat with someone who is fluent in either Italian or German. We could meet for coffee and speak half the time in English and the other half in the other language/s. It would be great if you live in Luzern send me a PM.   
Thanks,

			I did an ""understanding Swiss German"" course at the Volkshochschule in Basel.  It was really good.  Although it was entitled ""understanding"", we were also encouraged to speak it a bit, although it was fine if people only wanted to stick to German as well (but saying things out loud does help get them in your head I find).   
You had to have a minimum of B1 german to do the course, and I discovered that my greatest problem was understanding the other participants, most of whom came from Northern Germany and had a quite inpenetrable accent (well to me anyway!)   
There was not a class where I didn't think ""oh wow, that's what that means .."" so it was really worth while.  As we are in Basel, it was Basler SG, but as I come from the depths of Baselland, the teacher tried to differentiate where he knew things were said a little differently round us.   
All in all, would warmly recommend it.

			Well, you could post a tandem request (first thread in the language corner) and exchange language skills.   
If you don't get responses you could as well post at the notice board of the university:       
In which language do you communicate at work? Why are you in the hurry to learn English fast? It's a bit strange if a friendship is solely based on the need to learn English very fast. A bit more information could help. Maybe a tandem learning partner could be the right option and/or hanging out in Irish pubs.   
Concerning the short time period, an intensive language course could be necessary.

			I'm very sorry for that. 
You have to know that generally speaking Italians don't speak english so this fact could be the reason why you found this bad feedback from my  fellow citizens. 
Italian languege is very difficult but if you want to learn it you'll learn it.   
If I can help you, please let me know.

			The Beobachter magazine did a very good job and Pro Juventute should've been dissolved because of this scandal. The official Switzerland should've never allowed this program nor given the competences to Pro Juventute.   
About 30'000 Jenish people live in the country, only a couple thousand are still traditionally vagrant. Romansh on the other hand is spoken by about 50'000 Swiss.

Same in some parts of Thurgau.      According to new (= reformed) orthography, it's ""dass"" also in German German (in Swiss German standard it was already since the 1930's). And ""Schifffahrt"" with three f's is only logical and a simplification compared to the old system of ""Pressspan"" with three s's but ""Pressack"" with two, althoug it is a composite of ""Press-"" and ""Sack).    
I don't like the reformed orthography, but there are things that are substantially simpler and clearer now.

And that's NORMAL. Same with Swiss. Keep your accent, it's natural. It can still be perfectly correct High German. A fellow (very) Swiss teacher speaks dialect only to the cleaning ladies, otherwise I've never heard her speaking anything else than perfect High German... she however pronounces   with a long /o:/, like ""ohp"" that's quite disturbing but still, she has the nicest High German south of the Neckar.    
Swiss High German is perfectly fine. Local specificities are normal, and it's not any different in High German north of the Rhine (and of Schafhausen).   
Frankly, one hears usually quite clearly when a German comes from Schleswig or an old Hamburg fellow. They also have their own High German sometimes.

			Also it depends on the group of students.    
It's possible that you'll get real pain in the ar** know-it-all in either school.

And it is similar in case of TV, where also those in crime-stories where the Dative gets gradually eliminated. I think that the Genitive in German language in a not too distant moment will be something for the linguism-scientists.     
The books of Bastian Sick btw. are good and have read two of them.

			Hi jfl,  
I can recommend the Language School International. I was able to do a 2 week crash course there a couple of years ago, which meant I was busy from 9-3 every day. I didn't do it for a certificate but there were others there that were studying for an exam provided by the school.  
Hope this helps.

			Hi there, all very good advice.   
One tip........practice practice and more practice. Make your intentions clear to a native Swiss German speaker and go for it. Ask to be corrected when you get it wrong, but stick at it.   
You're sure to earn their respect (not always easy) if nothing else.   
Good luck to you.

			Just in case somebody wants to know: LENGTH OF VOWELS   
- First part: Vowels are long when followed by single consonant, short when followed by double consonant  
NOTE: ck, tz are ""doubles"" and ch is ambiguous as it can not be written double   
- Second part: Vowels are long when specifically elongated by -h or double-vowel. 
NOTE: Double-vowels are mostly low-German northern words that somehow found their way into the High German dictionary.  
EXCEPTION: IE. When comming from monophtongason of old ie pronounced /iä/ like in modern Swiss-German, the old spelling ie stayed for the new long vowel.   
- Third part: Elongation with -h (Dehnungs-H) is not specified before voiced occlusives (b,d,g) as the elongation always finds place in the official version of high-German (northern German accent keeps the old short vowels), the only exception being the absence of elongation in one low German word with low German spelling kept in Ebbe.   
- Fourth part: in -IEH-the h is not a Dehnungs-H but a remain of the shift due to Verner's law (hence shift h/g in ziehen/zog and h/ch in Vieh/Viecher)   
- Fifth part: Regional pronounciation may have kept the old short vowels, it's especially the case in the two extremes low-German and Swiss-German. Standart Bühnendeutsch however have consistent elongation of vowels in syllables with voiced consonant that where open originally at middle-high-German stage. With unvoiced consonant in that configuration, the vowel normally stays short and the spelling is double consonant.

			Sorry I cannot join, but just wanted to say that I have attended  german courses at the Volkshochschule for the last 5 years.  With only one exception (and I'm prepared to admit that was a simple personality clash!) all the teachers have been outstanding.  I am now studying for my German C1 Goethe Institute exam, having come to CH without ever having learnt a word of German.     
The courses are also very reasonably priced and I have got to meet a great mix of people, some of whom are now firm friends.   
Would warmly recommend this school.

Or have they? By law children must attend school. Unless you told them you were home schooling.   
The local schools I am most familar with maintain that the children are better off learning the German language in the village school rather than parents trying to give their children a head start with private instruction. In the past I had a lot of clients who wanted to use the summer before a move to try to help their kids get a better start and the schools advised against it saying it was better to start them off their way.    
One thing to keep in mind, as I am sure you have discovered, October 1 is a major moving time and after that the next main moving date is not until April. Not sure how long you have been looking but there is not much around at the moment.

I have two lessons of 2 hours per weeks, the teacher is good and also the book we are following, and Bellingua give us a lot of additional material. 
Then every two weeks we have a short test and it is really helpful, because it forces us to study in a regular way. 
I am finishing the A1 level and I can already notice that I undestand  more German and I can speak a few. I will continue with the next level.

			Hi, 
depending on your needs you may consider this option or a similar company :        
I am very sorry if i take away work from locals and EFs but for what i needed this company was a better option. Top journals in my field (fluid dynamics) are suggesting it together with others companies. I have used their services to edit my PhD thesis and it saved me several headaches.    
It is targeting academics that need help editing their English for technical papers. It is cheaper and much faster than any local editor and the paper will be edited by somebody with direct experience in your field.     
Locals editors that i had experience with had an amazing English but not technical enough to meet my advisor 'standards'. Here i have to say that my advisor is reeaaaalllly picky about it, and my field is quite technical and mathematical ... Moreover, local editors were not alway able to understand the deep logic of the period thus they were slightly changing the meaning and the logical implications of the sentences.     
Obviously, local editors have their major advantages (usually targeting different kind of customer, more flexibility, more personal interactions etc etc ) and you have to evaluate by yourself what do you really need and which is your best option.    
I have no conflict of interest with the cited company.

1548	08.09.2011, 12:47	Moddy McModface	Thanked 8,181 Times in 2,985 Posts	Location: Basel	"    I'd say ""Nein, danke"" is more frequent than ""Danke, nein,"" but the important thing in both cases is the ""no."" However, when there is no ""no,"" as in the case of ""Danke, ich muss noch fahren,"" things can get confusing for those who are not familiar with such peculiarities.     
It's not a Swiss or German problem, though. Such misleading situations can happen in just about any language. During my first months in Greece, I had to learn all sorts of such subtleties. Like, when you say, ""Den katalaveno,"" (""I don't understand""), that means you don't understand the language, but when you say, ""Den katalava"" (""I have not understood"" -- yes, sounds silly, but there is no really equivalent translation for the Greek aoristos), it means, ""Pardon me?"" I learned that during my first hour in Greece.    
On our little island, when the proprietor of one of those picturesque taverns on the waterfront asks me, ""Do you want to have a beer?"", that means he is treating me to it. If I tried to pay afterwards, I'd badly offend him. If, on the other hand, he asks, ""What do you want to drink?"", he's expecting a normal order.

1553	30.08.2006, 21:31	The Architect	Thanked 418 Times in 115 Posts	Location: Zollikon, Switzerland	"   , it is designed to provide some background information on some of the grammatical constructs used in English. Why? Knowledge of how certain things work in English can be directly applied when learning other foreign languages.      (for people who didn't go to school)      - A doing word e.g. run, jump, laugh, speak, be, have, become.    - A word which describes a verb e.g. quickly, slowly, patiently.    - A person, place or thing e.g. computer, internet, John, Zurich.    - Describes a noun e.g. big, small, smart, stupid.    - Replaces nouns indicating people e.g. I, me, you, him, her, they, them, myself.    - modifies noun and verb phrases e.g. for, with, at, on, below, through, around, by.       
Nominative case is simply a fancy name for the  of a sentence. Consider the sentence:       
The subject of the sentence is the dog. It's the part of the sentence that is performing the action (verb). Therefore we say that ""The dog"" is in nominative case.       
Accusative is also a fancy name for the   of a sentence. The object receives the action from the verb. So in our sentence above, the boy is the object.       
In English our sentence patterns are often formed with specific word order. Generally it is very easy for us to tell which part of the sentence is subject and object simply because the  subject  usually comes first, followed by a  verb , followed by the  object . Colours have been used to illustrate the point.         Other languages use different word order. Some may have an almost fixed pattern like English, and others may have variable order depending on the other elements in the sentence. German may be SVO or it may be SOV - in some cases the order of subject or object may be reversed.   
Therefore instead of thinking in terms of word order it is more useful to ask yourself the question ""Who is doing what to whom"". Who is giving the action, and who is receiving it?     
Consider the following:     
We know that the subject is ""I"", and ""am eating"" is the verb, but where is the object? We could imagine that the object is whatever might be in my mouth. So the sentence really looks like:     
What about :     Now the subject seems to be missing - but the person must be talking to someone, so it is most likely:           
Passive voice won't be covered here, it is mentioned only because these types of sentences do not fit into to the normal structure given above. Passive sentences do not contain an object. An example might be:   
Passive voice:  
Active voice:    
When trying to find the subject and object in passive voice the student may become confused, so it is important to at least recognise these types of sentences at this point.       
Can you see the subject and object in these sentences?     Now you can see that ""I"" is a nominative pronoun, and ""me"" is an accusative pronoun. Likewise he/she is nominative and him/her is accusative.    
If you are unsure about a sentence, try to rearrange it slightly so you can put ""I"" or ""me"" into the sentence. So if you are having trouble with:       
Change it to either:     , or   .   
Now by seeing where ""I"" or ""me"" would fit, you can instantly tell which part of the sentence is nominative and which part is accusative.       
Nominative and accusative case are not difficult, but unless you have a basic understanding of what they mean and how they work you will probably find that you can never progress past a certain point in the foreign language you are trying to learn. An understanding of how they work in your native language will be very important if you wish to also use them effectively in another European language.

It's in Morges, about halfway along the one-way street you drive through heading towards Lausanne, parallel with the lake.   
I really enjoyed it and learnt a lot, and there are classes at different levels and times of day, once or twice a week, etc. Much depends on the teacher, though - mine was marvellous (but she no longer works there). I also believe it's possible to swap if for some reason you don't 'click' with the group or teacher you're first allocated, they're quite flexible (as they want to keep you attending as long as possible, naturally  ). You sign up for a term at a time, so it's not a terribly long commitment, and I think I was allowed a free trial lesson before signing up.

I had very very basic knowledge of German (little to nothing), so I signed up for this class at Migro. Firstly, there was about 15 people in the class and only 3 of us spoke no German; the rest all spoke German but with poor grammar etc. Therefore us 3 were already at a distinct disadvantage, this therefore led the teacher to work at different speeds and favoured the German speaking students more.

			One can perfectly learn High German in Switzerland. So do the Swiss. It can even be less confusing, as Swiss High German words are integrated right from the beginning. In a course in Switzerland, you'll learn  right away. In Germany, you learn die S-Bahn (in Hamburg even die Hochbahn) and have to adapt when coming to Switzerland. It is no problem at all when you speak German very well (German people adapt very quickly) but it may be more disturbing as a beginner. I don't know, just guessing... I may be wrong.

			From the student side, having tried both, I must admit I always enjoyed the group lessons more. In the 1:1 situation I felt far too self conscious and kind of stupid - at least with others there I felt like I wasn't alone in my stupidity  (and realised that actually I was quite good compared to some of the others  ).    
Even though the teacher was very nice I just didn't enjoy the 1:1 situation. I imagine it depends on you as much as the teacher, but why not try both and see which you prefer?   
The most important part for me was being able to practice outside of classes, because my work was in English and pretty much everyone I knew spoke English. For that I'd highly recommend enrolling in some kind of other practical adult education class - like cookery or painting or DIY, to give you a chance to just hear the language being spoken in a normal setting outside of German class. Make it something where you can follow by copying - so not German literature or something, but anything where there will be practical work as well as listening. I learnt to drive here which did wonders for my German! Also, watch German TV as much as you can stand - start with something like the news (where they generally speak clearly!) or sports programs if you're into football or something.

			Hi, 
Try 'Flying Teachers', they will do home lessons. 
I guess you can also put a notice up in your local supermarket.    
I attended 'Inlingua' for French lessons in Zurich and they were great to deal with - but I don't know if they will send teachers to one's home. 
Bon courage

			Hello,   
I am trying to find a good conversation course in Zurich (Tandem is inefficient). I encountered this one:       
Any experience with this? It looks extremely cheap, but there are small groups (6-10 students in a class). Maybe the teachers are really bad (even though it seems like these classes are partially financed by some external source). Anyway, any information would be very appreciated.

			You will get there.  These things take time.  Most imporatantly that I have seen in people is that you are seen to be making an effort to communicate and learn how to communicate with them.   
I have travelled a lot all over the world over the last 3 years and often find myself in situaitons where I don't understand the majority language being spoken.  I have adopted the following tactics:   
I see if I can pick up the thread of the convesation and then if I feel that I have something to contribute, I will chip in and put my point across in English.....always prefixed by a polite ""excuse me but are you talking about .... "".  People will make a lot of allowances if you have something to contribute to a conversation and and often this can lead to you learning a lot as they explain what was being said and you can relate it to what you thought was being said.   
Occasionally feel free to chip in with the odd humourous    You need to pick the right circumstances for this one and read the crowd.  Sometimes they will give you a couple of minutes of English conversation.  Once again, the more you wow them with your conversational skills, the more they will make an extended effort to educate your into how to communicate with them.   
The more you hear ""Dude, you really need to learn German."" or the such, the more they are telling you that they want to help you.   
We are social creatures by nature, all embarressed by these situations and our languages.  A little humour and witty conversation and ice breakers always goes a very long way.

			This wasn't in Switzerland, but when I was in Montréal I took a ride up to the top of the observation deck at Olympic Stadium. One of the attendants noticed that I was wearing an Expos cap and asked me about the Washington Nationals. His English wasn't perfect, but he understood me until I said that as far as the Nats were going, we fans were ""waiting for the other shoe to drop."" Is there another idiom in French that means the same thing as expecting bad news to come?

			In regards to torrents: Get Nod32 or equivalent and read comments to each torrent. There problem solved.   
As for the original question, I've used Pimsleur for a few langauges and have found that the retention rate is quite high for everything you do. Downside is even after a few levels your vocabulary is quite low (less than 1000) but you should remember all of it. It's more for conversations rather than true knowledge of a language and you never see the words your learning so you can't learn to read. It starts off with Hi, how are you, good, where do you live, what, what do you want to eat, with me, with you, etc simple things but useful. 
If your an audio learner then it works well, if your visual well.....   
Rosetta Stone: I've never used it myself however from my understanding it's based on a picture/word approach similar to a site like livemocha.com (which is free, try it out). So you see a picture of a horse and the software says Cheval and you associate Cheval with a horse. And repeat.

And yes, with languages it depends on the language in question and you yourself. I always find Spanish fairly easy even if I never really learnt it, but Portuguese rather difficult. In Turkish, when trying some words in Turkish I tend to pronounce the Arab way, which they do not like at all. And as German is spoken by so many Turks in so many places so excellently, no problem. Greek is a language which is not mine, but as so many Greeks speak English, no problem. Hebrew is relatively easy, except that many words in Hebrew have quite a different meaning from the same word in Arabic, which irritate. But as virtually all Israelis speak English and amazingly many German, this also is no problem. Interesting was, when I had to make phone-calls to Argentina, the questions ""do you speak English"" ""parlez-vous Français"" lead to nowhere, but ""parliate Italiano""  had quite a positive result fairly often.

You just go there and ask about German language courses.  If there is one in the vicinity they will point you at it. 
The link I gave in my previous posting will direct you to your nearest course.     
But the teacher will usually know more than one language - to help a student totally unable to understand a given word! 
My teacher was a Linguist, and spoke very good english, as well as Albanian, Serb, French, Italian, Spanish, and a few other languages as well, but only used them in dire circumstances! He even knew the different Swiss dialects.

Does anyone have any ideas how I could help him with his German? My German level is pretty basic, although I am learning. I asked his kindergarten  German teacher who suggester we went to Orell Füssli but made no suggested of what to buy.

			I usually vary depending on what type of verb I'm using.   
If I follow it with a verb for a specific type of action, I tend to say ""er macht sich"" (ans Putzen, an den Abwasch, etc.)   
If not, which is often the case with the phrase ""going about,"" I use ""er stellt sich."" Meaning, he is going about it in whatever way: 
Er stellt sich dabei unbeholfen an/he's going about this is a clumsy way

			I must say I did sleep with a Britt regularly over years but we speak German. Beside English, I confess: intimate relations do boost the whole experience. More speaking time, more understanding, no bullshit answers, intensive practice etc. In one word: quantity.

For example, ""Okay, I'll see you later than."", instead of, ""Okay, I'll see you later th n.""

			hi, 
i played DI college tennis and have 3 years teaching experience at private country clubs for the past 3 summers. now i started my professional career and don't play anymore (mostly because its too expensive in switzerland).   
i've been living in switzerland for about 9 months, am on level 4 of german rosetta stone, and also took an A2 klubschule course last winter. i am determined to reach fluency within the next 6 months, and i think private lessons are the next step to reach my goal.

			You can learn a lot in an intensive week - enough to get by at a very basic level- especially if you ditch your mother tongue and go for full immersion. You will have a head like a football (I remember it well) but it will pay dividends. Sadly I cannot offer to help as I live too far away- but would be quite happy to offer this for French.

			My guess is, as this assistant apparently never really worked closely with the children/parents, she would be aware that the parents have been asked to write a few lines.        
If it's for someone who knows my child, I'd favour something put together by the children, and be it ""only"" a potted flower with some wire-paper butterflies made by the wee ones, and a painting.    
And that's only for starters. But as the OP wrote - the assistant didn't spend much time with her child.

She is called Elena Selva   As Skype may prove to be a weird channel, what she normally does is to provide a free-of-charge lesson to a potential new student to make sure he/she feels comfortable with this system.  Further, as I said she provides personalized lessons, i.e.: she has a folder for each of the students where she gathers specific information on the student, such as: objectives, performance, common mistakes, and so forth. This way, she makes sure there is an learning evolution.  I believe shes got a great approachin fact, I am looking for something similar for myself in German,   Hope it helps!

My frustration led me to speaking more and more English at home and after I while we stopped using Spanish.  Now I regret this almost daily after seeing how easy my kids have learned German...  ! 
I suggest that you keep speaking English to them even if they answer in German, I bet you they are understanding and retaining everything and the speaking part will come later.  Maybe when they get older they'll be more willing to speak it with you.  I am trying to spend some time now playing games and reading books in Spanish with my kids which keeps their interest and it doesn't feel like extra work for them (My oldest son is now 10 and he actually remembers a lot of words), hopefully this will begin to mend my dumb mistake. 
Good luck!

			I live in your city - the commune might have some lessons for you, even better choices for females. They are slow paced and catered to new arrivals pending their approval for settlement ( asylum seekers for example ), new arrivals such as a foreign spouse and so on. These are low cost and not more than once / 4 hours a week. More information from your Stadt Verwaltung, Florhofstr. 6   
In CH, normally one adapts to the way things are, and not the other way around. Private lessons IMO are the best options for you. There are plenty of DE teachers who can be flexible enough to meet your needs. If you need a certificate of proficiency ( A1, A2, B1 etc. ), you might have to sign up at the test center and / or school, nearest being in Zurich city.

1649	16.06.2011, 15:39	Member	Thanked 90 Times in 56 Posts	Location: Zürich	"    When Friedrich Däniker of the Däniker English Bookshop died in 1989 at only 70 years, his shop was sold to Orell Füssli, who integrated it into their mainshop, but in a rather bad way. Unacceptably bad, a real shame. When Mr Staeheli, a great chap actually, died 10 years later, his shop also was taken over by Orell Füssli, and I feared the worst. But Orell Füssli in the meantime had come under the influence of a family of real professionals from München, and so, what now is the ""English Bookshop"" at Rennweg was continued as was the Interlingua. The Interlingua amazingly retained the Staeheli name to some extent, which is nice. I think that now, both great old gentlemen would be happy to see what has come out of their two shops     
The start of the Staeheli English bookshop had a cultural-political background. Up to WW-II, lots of German language books were simultaneously printed  in Leipzig, Wien + Zürich, as Leipzig was the Capital of German bookprinting. In the first few years of Nazi rule, it was still possible to print good books in Germany, amazingly as it looks. BUT after about 1936, all changed, and books from Leipzig were filled with Nazi ideology. So, as a result of that, Mr Staeheli and his partner decided to go into English language books.

It obviously isn't my day.    
As the quote you put in told the story, I thought it would be OK.

			Okay I am going to attempt to post this one more time, since the last two wouldn't post.  Where to start......my name is Tyra and I am in the U.S.  I found this forum due to teasing from a friend.  He would say things to me in what I now lovingly refer to as swissy (Berndeutsch).  He would taunt me with the fact that there was no translator online that could tell me what he was saying.  Well he was wrong........I found all of you here.  lol.  He even gave me the old chuchichaschtli test!  He and I have become rather close in the months that have passed since this has all started.  He is an amazing man.  He calls me Sweetness and his Sunshine, he has told me macht das dsunne schint.  I make his sun shine.  I wanted to impress him so I'd ask for some translations and how to say certain things on this forum.  Unfortunately he has been right though, I don't have many resources.   
I read your thread about the resources for learning swiss german and some of it has proved to be helpful, but very little.  Most of the listed resources are in German then going to Swiss German or they are not the dialect I am looking for.  I also saw your post about tandem language partners but most people are in Switzerland for that.  I am here in the U.S.  There are no classes here and not much in resources to learn Swiss German in general let alone Berndeutsch.  I want to be able to talk to this man in his beautiful language not mine.  Sorry for the long winded explanation.  I guess what I am getting at.... is I am asking if someone on here could help a little american girl learn some real Swiss German (preferrably Berndeutsch).  I am fully aware that learning another language does not happen over night.  If someone on here invested their time in teaching me I promise you I will not waste it.  Any help would be much appreciated, more than you'll ever know.  I will be in debt to you.   
Merci Vilmal

			Hello Simon,   
My name is Nicholas,   
I am actually a Swiss citizen but have lived in the UK since I was about 5 years old and been in China for the past 4 years.   
My mother tongue was Swiss-German, which I unfortunately 'forgot' due to the lack of exposure to it.   
I am at an intermediate stage of fluency in Mandarin and my English is about as British as it gets.   
I am highly keen on regaining ground in Swiss-German and would be more than glad to exchange it for Mandarin and English. The only matter of Concern is that I currently am not in Switzerland so that the exchange (were you so inclined) would have to be undertook via means of something a liken to Skype.   
If you are interested at all, please feel free to contact me via PM   
Yours Respectfully,   
Nicholas.

			I find Swiss more tolerent than Germans on that one. In Germany, I would check the gender first or go for Frau Müller and see if the Müller in question reacts to that... if it's a Herr, you just have to add a sentence in your next letter with a polite appology and if it is a Frau, it's bingo. My experience: Frauen hate to be called Herr and make big fuzz (German expression for that would be    ), the other way around will just be politely corrected without declaration of war.    
But in CH, I'd go for Frau/Herr Müller if you really can't call them to find out gender or get the first name on a website or email address.

1665	07.01.2011, 17:42	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Ireland! YAY!	"    I'm also Irish and am currently trying to get into university in Switzerland in the city of Fribourg.   
I am not 100% sure if this is the same for all universities but the few that I have checked require the following for entry (this includes normal universities and the engineering schools): 
1) 6 leaving certificate subjects. 
2) Minimum of 3 at higher level with a C or higher in each. 
3) Minimum of 3 at ordinary level with a C or higher in each. 
4) Of the 3 higher level subjects one must be in a natural science or maths. 
5) There is generally a language exam required for entry. Each universities / engineering school's language level required differs.   
If you decide to come to switzerland to study it would of course be best to find out first hand from the university what is required.   
I have lived in Fribourg for the last year learning french for entry to the university here (high langauge level required for Fribourg, b2+ in german or french in reference to CELP). Fribourg is very much a student town, similar to galway I would say.   
I can give you a rundown of what kind of prices you'd be facing if you like (of course those would be figures for fribourg).

			when I first came I chose private lessons in the place closest to my work.  It cost 110 CHF per hour which I find a huge amount of money but I figured it would be worth it.  When I arrived the informed me that the sell these lessons in blocks of 10 - which meant that I owed them 1100 CHF, all I had done was sent an email!   
I didn't care for the teaching style or the materials so I didn't renew after this initial welcome to Switzerland experience.  I have since done a one year course of 2 hours per week and a LOT of my own work, I am now able to communicate quite well, here are the resources I have used, some are free some are low cost   
All the best!       Here is the translation dictionary that I use, you can get a toolbar in your browser and when you highlight a word you click a link to go straight to the translation, make a user account and you can save words to your vocabulary list   www.dict.cc     If you need to know how to conjugate a verb then go to the next link   http://www.verbix.com/languages/german.shtml   Type in the infinitive and your off     http://www.canoo.net/   Very good resource - does too many things for me to explain     Podcasts   www.slowgerman.com   www.geo.de  (seacrch for podcasts)     They are free - the first one is good for beginners.     Reading   www.spiegel.de   A bit advanced but easier than speigel magazine which I also recommend when you progress   www.geo.de   Also not really ideal for beginners - but the stuff they write about is really interesting so keep it for when you progress     www.bkyi.com   Flashcard software - you can get free stuff which is good for beginners or buy it if you want to make your own, I make my own and find it really helpful     I can't remember the text to speech software that I use at the moment, I have it at home.  It isn't free but for the package and two native German voices I paid about CFH 100 - well worth it for what I have been able to do.  You can make mp3s and have them playing on your ipod while you work.  This takes care of all memory work which doesn't have any logic.       I really recommend this   http://www.amazon.co.uk/Frequency-Di...2307674&amp;sr=8-1   It is not really cheap but again well worth it - instead of learning random stuff you can learn the words that are used the most.

Being in the French speaking part of CH - your closest CELTA centre is in Geneva (The Bell School) see link above.   
At this moment in time you can only do the CELTA there, and in Zurich (FT)Full time and in Baden (The language Centre) part time   
As from next year you'll be able to also do the CELTA in St Gallen (part time with Cambridge ESOL) and in Basel Full-time (based at academia school)   
I was a tutor on a CELTA course in York UK.                
1) Fees for the intensive course in the UK are much lower than here in CH    
1095 pounds in the UK - between 3,700 - 4,000+CHF in Switzerland   
(this means if you know someone you can stay with in the UK, it can actually turn out cheaper to do it there)   
2) The CELTA course and your experience on it very much depends on the type of tutors you have.    
3) If you opt to do the intensive don't even consider commuting anymore than 40 mins   it is very intensive to say the least.   
4) The CELTA certainly will help in getting you through the door and into jobs, but the certificate is done in 4 weeks - it provides you with a foundation or a basis to work from. In other words teachers post CELTA normally still need plenty of professional development and training.   
5) Based on the above point - once you have the CELTA it isn't ideal to just then go off and teach in isolation - good schools will offer teachers   internal development opportunities in the form of workshops and teachers meetings and the possibility of a mentor system. These are very valuable. Good schools will also offer to pay for 1 or 2 newer teachers to attend national ETAS conferences as part of that development.     
Hope that helps somewhat 
Steph

			When I first came here I used a company called  . They give lessons to adults and children (ages 6 - 12) via Skype. For some of the course options you have to purchase books, and some have a requirement for homework which you then e-mail to your tutor.    
I found them very flexible, and supportive. I was hospitalised and the owner and my tutor sent me a get well card, and when I came out of hospital they arranged for me to switch to a different lesson model that meant less pressure - and they gave me a good deal on the switch.    
I don't know of anyone who has used the children's course, but if it's anything like the adult lessons it will be good, and the advantage is it's in the comfort of your own home.

			It's anderer, Genitiv indefinite with strong ending. 
If you want the definite, then it's der anderen with weak ending, it's plural.   
""Emphasize"" is a generic term. Sure is that the first place is a special place. The word is actually  . Sentence structure is devided in two parts of speech (since Aristoteles, revamped by the functionalists linguists): Topic and comment (also called Thema - Rhema by Germanists). Look up functional perspective, Prager School and functional grammar.

The official things or your specialty (science, IT, knitting ...) have a limited vocabulary and you have a pretty good idea what's coming next. Conversation is much more open ended.

			Hey all,   
I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but you all seem pretty nice, so here goes:   
I'm currently a grad. student in education in Hawaii.  In a year and 2 months, I'll have a master's in teaching (secondary English).  My wife and I have a dream to live in Switzerland...specifically Basel.  We've never even been to Europe, but love traveling, languages, and culture.  We've also spent a lot of time in Japan (she's Japanese), so we're very comfortable living in countries other than our own.  We want to make this dream a reality, so we're both studying Pimsleur German.  Will that work for getting around Switzerland?  There is also a Pimsleur Swiss German, but it's only like 10 lessons vs. the 90 for the more ""standardized"" German.   
Also, any other enlightening info on life in Switzerland and Basel would be great!  Is it hard getting a teaching job in Basel?  Would love to work at the international school or even a Swiss school for that matter, though that would have to wait for the language skills to improve.

			From what I could listen to on youtube, the most typical Baseldeutsch without rolling-r is this one:       
She still says Kh- and not Ch- for High German K- and that is not always the case anymore, influence from the rest of the country, one believes:    and    
But she has the rounded ü in   (Leute), für whereas one also hears   and   with long /i:/ sometimes. She sounds very much like my neighbours and the dialect I hear normaly spoken by adults. The younger generation speaks however something between that and Zürcher Deutsch (or is it just their way that I feel ""strange"" and wrongly qualify as Zürcher?)

			Would very much appreciate any info, insights, experiences with Eurocentres.  I emailed them and below is the response that I got from them.  I understand the teacher is the most important part of the learning experience, so I will be interviewing them tomorrow.    
I am interested in taking french lessons   
Also some questions   
How do you compare to other schools 
- a friendly professionnal team with aims and sucessfull methods in 29 schools 
around the world for more than 40 years    
What makes your school unique: 
- our professionalism and the way we follow the students, the atmosphere of the 
school   
What is the teaching style used 
- communicative teaching and work on 4 competences: speaking, listening, reading 
and writing   
How many students in a class: 
- max 14   
What is the teachers background: 
- master (university) and specific pedagogical study   
What is the average profile of the students: 
From 16 years old until 84, international and all social environments   
What is the proficiency of students once they finish the beginners intensive  
Class: 
- depends on their own capacity, but when we say that the level is reached, they 
can interact in a simple way, askand answer simple questions about themselves, 
where they live, people they know and things they have, initiate and respond to 
simple statements in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.

			Bonjour! 
I live in Basel, a bit too far maybe to meet up especially I have no car but if you can write to me in French if you want! I am French, and I have lived in the UK for 10 years before ending up in Basel a few months ago. I have 2 children, one is 3 and the other one is 13 weeks old! That keeps me quite busy at home! I studied a bit Mandarin a few years ago, I loved it, I think it is such a great language. I actually finds it easier to learn than German! My German is close to zero but I am learning, step by step, as much as I can. So maybe I could try to write to you in German and you could write to me in French.  
A+ (short for ""speak soon"")

Angst and gemütlich have now found their way into the English Dictionary for the same reason. Cosy, the 'nearest thing' to gemütlich is, by implication, 'small gemütlich' and somehow sounds stupid for a bigger group or bigger room.

			There are two different things:   
- There is a determinant/article in front, in your sentence: zwei.  
- The questions is: Does it have the needed ending matching Gender/case? 
- When not (here because it is a number where one can not add an ending), then the normal ending goes over to the adjective if there is one. - If several adjectives, they all take the same ending, for order and clarity's sake.  
- If yes, the normal ending is on the determainant/article (eine, dem, jener, dieses...) then the adjective take a ""fill-in"" ending just to fill in the blanc. 
- There are three cases where ein does not take an ending even though it logically should (Masculin Nominative, Neuter Nominative, Neuter Accusative). The normal ending jumps over to the adjective if there is one.   
Therefore:     
D er  rot e  Hut steht mir gut

			Ok, here is the first part and the Refrain in some poor english:   
Sepp has a cat that reproduces very fast 
thats why he gives the cat as a present to his godchild 
he takes a basket and puts the animal in it 
and wrote ""she is yours forever""   
Refrain: 
But the cat returns, suddenly she stands there 
The cat returns with the kittens arranged behind 
You won't believe it, it's kind of gruesome (not sure about that) 
miau, miau, miau, in front of the house she stands   
Now you can rearrange it and make a nice english version.

			How about us getting back on topic. Has anyone been in this situation? What did you do? 
My first thought was, if you don't 'have' to use the language in everyday life, go for a trip, even a short one, to the country or area of the language that you are learning and try out the bit you already have. Sometimes it is depressing, but sometimes, when you understand just few words, you are very motivated to have another shot.  
Sometimes taking a short break isn't a bad thing. You don't forget all you have learned by any means, and listening to an early lesson, or reading one of the first chapters again, can be quite fun.

			Hey there,   
Not that my German doesn't need polish (it does) but I was hoping to find a place to study French at night/weekends so I could communicate with my in-laws. I live in brugg, so it's not exactly French central here. Anyone know of a good language school?

			Hello,   
I am looking for somebody who can offer private German classes at a good price or in eschange for Spanish lessons. I am a certified teacher of Spanish and professional translator of English. I am very good with languages so I would like just somebody who can explain some small issues and give me some direction of what to study. At the moment I am only working part time as a Spanish teacher so I need somedy who can make a good offer for classes or somebody who is interested in exchanging the lessons for Spanish. Please note that I am not interested in just making conversation in German I need somebody that can more or less explain and teach me the language. 
I live in Kreis 6 and have a place that I use for teaching Spanish so we could make the lessons there or somewhere in the city.   
If you are interested please send me a PM.   
PS: I need somebody that commit meeting at least once a week. I had students before teaching me German but it was terrible to have a class a month so please only write if you can commit minimum one hour a week   
Thanks!!!

			Interesting for anyone who is thinking about one of the Goethe institute's advanced exams. I came across this today.      (in German)   
Essentially, the Kleines Deutsches Sprachdiplom (KDS), the Grosses Deutsches Sprachdiplom (GDS) and the Zentrale Oberstüfungsprüfung (ZOP) will be merged from next January, into one qualification: .   
Interesting, as the new GDS will be C2, while it is currently beyond C2. Anyone taken the GDS here?

Before you buy French films, have a look on any existing DVDs you may have to see what other languages the subtitles/audio is available - French is sometimes one of the available options.

			Go figure, I came here to learn German. I arrived here 3 months and 2 weeks ago and I started my German classes after 2 weeks of my arrival.  
I have been wanting to learn German since I was in Gymnasium but most of the schools in my country offer English, French, Latin, some even Russian, German-not so many schools, unless you go to a School or High School that have German classes or everything is in German. I learned English, French and bit Latin.  
Anyway, none of my friends speak German so I was watching TV programmes in German which I liked and I was keep saying that  I want to learn German, it sounds so nice, I like the writting  bla bla. 
So I said ''Ok, I really want to learn German and I have to do something about it''. So I came here. Before coming here I was saying ''Oh I will learn it quite fast, I understand a bit, I know the basic words'' so I was enthusiastic and open to everything that my German course and teacher would offer me. Of course I know and I have been told by so many people in my country and even here that German is not an easy language and why do I really want to learn it? Well, I just want to. 
Now, after 3 months, what do I know?- waaaay too less things than I expected!! I think I expected too much from my self!! I can not believe that after 3 months of German classes I am cr@p. I understand, I read quite well, I write well but my speaking sucks. I have no words, I don't know how to make a right sentence and I am confused. 
I even have some people in my class that have been living here for 4yrs or 6 yrs and they don't speak German! I didn't ask them but the reasons in my opinion are: they have a job that doesn't require German, their friends and families don't speak German and they preffer to speak their native language, when they go shopping they just pick things from the shelf or search for them untill they find it, instead of asking for help, and they just pay on the way out, if they need help somewhere they will just use their English. 
In my case I want to apply for UZH but apparently they only have  1 German test a year, in January 2011, and I have to get to a B2 level by then, for me it is impossible! I am going to an A1 level eventhough all the tests I am taking (online) say I am an A2 towards B1 level (maybe they are wrong) but I am so dissapointed because I can't apply next year and I will lose a year just like that, that I don't even have the drive to learn German anymore, I feel I came here for nothing and it will take me so much time to learn it that I will get bored of it. In fact I am bored on my German class because everybody is slow and I don't like being slow, I want to progress. I think I will change the class/level or take a break.

			The International English route really is the way to go for anyone typing more than three umlauts/accents in a message. The cut/paste from the Character map can truly get tedious.   
You can easily *push in the clutch* for the International English for the duration and then then shift back. As soon as you define multiple input languages, you can get a little menu added to the task bar with a keyboard button from which you can switch back and forth. (Be careful: I often accidentally stumble upon the keyboard shortcuts (which I've since disabled) to switch between input locales).   
These characters are called ""diacriticals"" - consisting of the accent character and then the accented character (e.g.: "" and then a  to form ä). If you ARE in international English and you want one of the characters, if you just press "", you'll see nothing. I often use "" followed by a space. Once the diacritical isn't ""satisfied"" (i.e., after "" you enter something for which there's no umlaut), you get the "" and then the character. "" and then z gives you ""z. "" and then space gives you only the "" (the same holds true for the others, "", ', etc.). ' and e gives you é. Oddly, ' and c gives you ç.

			I'm not sure if this Thread is in the right place. If you are looking for someone to help you with your English 'professionally' then this belongs in Jobs offered. If you want to brush up your English 'for free' then you could do a tandem offering Italian (if you are a native or very fluent Italian speaker) in the 'Tandem' Thread here in Language Corner. If you are looking for social contacts to chat in English then try the Daily Life, Other/General, Social Events sections to see if other folk are meeting up somewhere near you.

			Hi,    
For anyone who is keen on learning German, i highly recommend Bellingua which is near Lowenstrasse. I like the fact that they offer halb-intensive course (twice a week), alot of other schools only offer 5-day intensive courses. The teachers are really good and the administrative staff are helpful and very efficient. This is not a publicity ad, but after trying out a few other schools, i know how frustrating it must be to feel like some schools are only keen on earning your $$$.

Fortunately most of my work is graphics based and does not require high proficiency of German.  I have had a lot of experience of Project and People Management in UK (I'm APMP qualified) and would like to transfer these skills over to my work in Switzerland.     Therefore, my Manager and I have agreed to send me on a German course.  However, I'm struggling to find the right one to suit my standard.  Ideally, I would like a course aimed at introduction to German business language.  My spoken German is very good (in a social environment) but my written German (particularly grammar) is awful!!!        Does anyone have any suggestions for where I can get good advice on this matter or can anyone recommend a suitable course for me?  I work near Lenzburg in Aargau and live near Bremgarten, so any course in this region would be preferable.     Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.     Kind regards

			I'm interested in learning Bündnerdeutsch, as I'm quite fascinated by the culture of our (current) neighbour Canton.   
Much to my dismay however I could find no resources whatsoever at the cantonal library here in town about Bündnerdeutsch - or about any other Swiss German dialect for the matter.    
Can anybody suggest good phrasebooks, grammars, dictionaries or other printed or web materials and resources that would help me familiarise with this dialect?   
Also, do you know of narrative or comics written in this dialect, that I could get hold of?   
Or is there any native Grisonian here I could maybe pester with my questions?

			Several discussions on leo:       
Grammatically the comma does change the meaning, but this is a slogan, so here the sense would be to interpret the sentence as a whole with the comma separating a subjunctive clause.   
You could say and this would carry the meaning. Here also this could be interpreted in two ways but the sense is clear from the interpretation.

Mau - Mol (Agreeance or confirmation) 
Nid - Nöd  (Not)

			It's all about cases.   
Q: Wie geht es Ihnen? A: Gut. Und Ihnen?  ""Ihnen"" refers to the indirect object of the verb ""gehen"". So the dative case required. (  geht es gut?)   
Q: Was haben Sie gestern gemacht? A: Ich habe gearbeitet. Und Sie?  ""Sie"" refers to the subject of the verb ""machen"". So the the nominative case is required. (  hat etwas gemacht?)

			The best program, other than going to an intensive German program of some kind, currently I've been going to inlingua for the last 3 months, and can recommend them, is Digital Publishing Inensivkurs Deutsch.    
You can buy the program seperate for 78CHF or together (1 and 2 which covers through B2 level) with a vocab trainer for 168CHF. Hope this helps.[/QUOTE]

			First of all, Ziger, you did not understand that danish is not even my mother tongue.  
Secondly, intelligibility in scandinavia is defined as intelligibility between speakers of different languages. 
Third point, intelligibility between English speakers is a question of intelligibility between speakers of the same language.   
So, one more time more simple words: 
It is easy to understand each other NO/DK with a little willingness although the differences are defining them as different languages,  
THUS, 
understanding other English speakers should not be more difficult that scandinavians among themselves do.   
But do NOT put words into my mouth, what you infer about yourself from my message are your imagination only, not my words.  
And don't lecture me on topics I have a master degree in and places I spent six years in. Thanks.

A playgroup would also be a good idea but I can't find one close to me (area Pfäffikon SZ). I would like a place where I can leave the children and where I don't need to stay in.  
I still think that a story teller would a good idea and there might also be someone else who is looking for the same. I would already know a person who would love to do this but this person is looking for a bigger group of children (age 3+).

			Native standard Chinese speaker w/ higher education in both China and US, is looking for anyone with high proficiency in High German and interested in learning Chinese.     
I have zero knowledge in German, would like to start from pronunciation and alphabet.  So it would be good if you speak high German and also with good knowledge of grammar. I would offer Chinese Putonghua from beginning to advanced business level in exchange.    
The instrumental language would be English or Chinese depending on your choice.

			Here is a link to the Swiss German version of Wikipedia. Useful, because written Swiss German is hard to find.       
It is listed under Alemannisch. I would be interested to know what native Swiss German speakers think of this as a resource for learning Swiss German.

1833	18.10.2010, 14:29	Junior Member	Thanked 4 Times in 4 Posts	Location: Somewhere over that way	"    Interesting is relative - depends what you like...   
German TV shows: 
- Schlag den Raab - it's a show where some candiates compete against a German TV moderator in different kinds of sports 
- TV Total - kind of like a late night comedy show with the same guy as in the above Stefan Raab 
- Wetten dass...? - live bets on TV with celebrities 
- Wer wird Millionaer? - German version of who wants to be a millionaire - might actually be good for learning german vocab 
- Deutschland sucht den Superstar - German version of American Idol or Pop Idol   
TV series: 
- Tatort - crime series 
- Galileo - more like a knowledge/documentary series 
- Komissar Rex - not sure if that one actually still runs but its also a crime series - main character is a German shepherd 
- Der Alte - crime series 
- Ein Fall fuer 2 - also crime series     
Im not a soap fan and I cannot stand Desperate Housewives, Lost, all these soppy hospital series etc. I have a short attention span when it comes to those and I cannot follow every day whilenothing ever happens and then the season ends. If you want cheesy German soaps though, try Lindenstrasse, Marienhof, Unter Uns, Gute Zeiten Schlechte Zeiten, Verbotene Liebe.   
I assume you can get these online somewhere. ARD and ZDF (German public TV stations have shows online, look for the Mediathek on their websites   and   )

Have a look here:     
There are plenty options available, but they might not al be at high standards. Also have a look in the local library and pick up an language comuter course and put an ad on the noticeboard.

			I am not sure what you expect from your French speaking friends, if it is to learn the lingo - think about what benefit they would have form hanging out with you...It sounds funny, I know, but if people speak no language or a very little, it gets boring to constantly correct. If you speak well, then of course you will find friends in no time (yes, it is efficient), especially given your outgoing personality, etc. But if your level is low, take a class and maximize your exposure (extra conv classes, language exchanges, etc.) Volunteering is really good, people are patient, will help you out. But you might want to rethink your apparel maybe, image, etc. - some of the religious volunteering organizations might object   and also the fact that culturally, people here are a lot more...low key, down playing themselves, not as suggestive, etc. and from your posts, it seems you are one of a big kinky party animal. So, if you want friends, you will most probably click with similar mindsets, students, young organisations (there is something called Org for free time, I know they have bunch of courses, afternoon activities, Geneva is really good with this, google it). Uni is a great source for activities, as well. In fact, I am heading today to a Ge mycological society, since I love picking mushrooms and it is too cool to miss. Might not be your cup of tea, but the French I am learning - fab, much better than courses! Just look around, go to theater groups, some activity driven bunch of peeps, so you don't just party. Good luck and up and at it (books ain't that bad, afterall, I promise...)

			You'll be just fine.  I live a couple of miles up the road from EPFL and belong to their library (open to all Swiss residents, not just students).  A very large proportion of the books are in English, all the library staff speak terrific English - there will be plenty of people for you to talk to, and who will happily give you a hand with translating an electric bill and whatnot.   
In the wider area, you could very easily 'survive' with just English, but will of course have a better and more enriching experience if you move into French-speaking circles.  Any attempt at all with the language, even if the conversation then switches to English, is met with encouragement and pleasure as so many people here just stay in their English comfort zone and expect the shop staff, mechanics, etc to make all the concessions.   
Lots of info on here already about good ways to learn languages - scan the threads.   
Good luck for your move.

			Your English has a lot of grammar errors and oddities.  For the most part your sentences are understandable but take some work to get through.  For example, I have noticed that saying ""Ein dunkles Weizen, bitte"" in a pub works far better than ""Ein dunkel Weizen, bitte"".  The former is actually understood faster and easier even though both should be obvious.   
I will give you a few points to remember, but really an instructor should be explaining this to you in person:   
In English it extremely rare and somewhat poetic to have an object be ""he"" or ""she"".   
Next, you normally don't want a comma before that. Especially when it introduce a clause serving as an object.  ""I see that you are right."" is right, ""I see, that you are right."" is wrong.    
""like for example"" is extremely casual, you would in any serious writing replace it with something else, such as ""such as"".   
P.S. I think that billhardie made some changes which are themselves mistakes. e.g. reknown is not a word in English and ""such as 'thanks giving' for example"" is redundant in a bad way.

			It is 246 Fr. for the entire term.  That is 4 hours/week (Tues and Thurs 9am-11am) from the start through Feb. 10.  It would have started this week if enough people signed up, but it will start when they get 10 people.  They also have childcare available for children 6 months and older for $150 for the term.  I don't know if they will prorate the cost for the time missed due to a late start date.  But it's such a deal!   
Please sign up everyone!  Thanks again!

Hi, there are usually professional translators on the list in the Zivilstandsamt, so why not ask them? German-English is not a problen Dutch may be a little more difficult to find :-)  rare language pair.   
I am a professional translator myself, but unfortunately I live in Zug. I would love to help but the travel is too far and this would increase the cost of service for you. So you may want to find someone in Baden.   
try   you may find someone there.   
Good Luck!

If you will be trying to speak in every of the three languages it's your effort that counts and people will (/should) be tolerant about slip-ups.

1912	null	null	null	null	"    Not really.  If I knew a bit of Welsh or a bit of Rumantsch, yes, I would probably go out of my way to find practice opportunities.  I would chat indefatigably about yesterday's weather and My Hometown and the new red shoes of the baker's wife's cousin's daughter and be thrilled just to be   the language no matter how banal the topic.     
Living in Zurich, though, I get enough German immersion just going about my daily life that I don't feel the need to seek it out specially.  As it is, I socialize pretty indiscriminately: I go out with whoever I feel like  going out with, and speak whichever language that calls for as well as I  can, and if I can't speak it I nod and smile.  I don't exclaim over new  idioms, take notes or ask people to repeat themselves because (a) I  have a special horror of being a nuisance, and (b) it is too much like  work.  Treating your whole social life as a language lab may be a worthy idea  but it is   tedious.

			When talking to Germans, even ""real"" Swiss tend to translate - Handy - because they know Natel is widely unknown in Germany.  
When speaking to foreigners in German, some Swiss will keep the perfectly Schriftdeutsch Natel, others will change it into the more German Hochdeutsch Handy. Some Swiss may think (wrongly) that Natel is dialectal and will be hypercorrect and use the German word that they think is more Hochdeutsch.   
In short: you will hear both, but mind the reasonning behind the word change. And Natel is perfectly correct Swiss Hochdeutsch, written and spoken.

1934	07.08.2010, 23:43	Forum Veteran	Thanked 581 Times in 255 Posts	Location: California	"    Yes, it does, especially when speaking.   
When writing, the mistakes appear quite obviously, because it is very rare that a word properly spelled can have either a masculine or feminine meanings .   
When speaking, the gender-mistakes can be of little importance quite often, but it can also be really confusing with a bit bad luck, or too much confidence/persistence in the ""wrong"" gender.   
Some words, by sound, have different meanings when they are used with a masculine or feminine article. Here are some examples that pop to my mind :   
 - la fête (the party), le faîte (the top) or le fait (the fact).   ( ) /=    
 - un fil (a thread, or a phone call), une file (a queue).    
 - un noeud (a knot), une (one, a she-thing).  .   
 - un père (the father) une paire (a pair).    
 - la vie, le vit... J'aime la vie, j'aime le vit...   
It can also be confusing, and turn a proper sentence in a mess (so imagine the mess it can become if there is some additional mistakes...) For example : 
 - [correct]   ( ) 
 - [not correct]   ( , with a lacking article for  , and a foreigner-like pronunciation for  )   
The gender gets also declined, so the mistake can become more subtle : 
- [correct]  (de le => du ) 
 - [not correct]  de la pain = deux lapins, so: )   
If you use a pronoun (il/elle) for naming wrongly a feminine/masculine thing, then it become even more confusing.   instead of  .   
I guess it requires some serious efforts to remember the masculine/feminine of things, but it's worth it. People having French as their mother tongue would almost never mingle the masculine and feminine of things, so it's quite unexpected for them when foreigners make such mistakes, especially when the mistakes are amplified by a logically-correct declinations of adjectives and pronouns; for example:  , the mistake can be understood only when the last word is pronounced, and before that,  and   had quite rule out the eventuality that the feminine word   would be finally pronounced, let's say that some French-speaking would think the last pronounced is more likely tableau (masculine) than table.

			Hello. I need some help...   
I am trying to learn French on my own and need a good textbook that is well-written and thorough. I'd prefer to find a book with CD audio that starts from the basics and continues on from there. I've previously studied a beginner course but the listening lessons were not useful at all. They spoke so fast that I couldn't follow the dialog.   
Can someone recommend a good one?

			Although I have been living in Solothurn for the past 41 years (now Feldbrunnen just down the road) I never actually took a German course here. I learnt Russian at the Migros Klubschule in Langendorf for 10 years and found it quite a good course. Otherwise, from what I have heard, the VHS is quite good for learning languages. I learnt German in England for 2 years before I arrived, and then had to rethink. I now speak mainly Swiss German, but can manage with high German. I just picked it up from my husband and the kids.

Effectively it is simply a document that waives your rights to something and to be permitted must explain the extent of what you are giving up. 
Examples include: 
for bequests which might also be of negative value,  
for freeing the organiser of an event against subsequent claims maybe when a band plays poorly or it rains so you can't pitch a tent etc 
for freeing against claims of value something for which you have not paid classically here are free air tickets through collecting miles 
For transferring a mobile number to another company (the telephone company needs to declare their willingness to give up a number out of their block so the number can be used by the new provider)   
And so it goes on.

			Hello,   
Thanks for your answer. The cost I can recall exactly if I pay CHF 570 or CHF 590 but it is about this range (incl. the material and for 40 hours). We were following the class starting at 7.30pm till 9 pm every day ( if one can not come, they are quite flexible to postpone it)   
I know it sounds very long but it is so much fun because they force you to talk, therefore the time passes by so quickly.

			I admire the guy though I can not image how he can do it in three months. I have learned German for exactly three months but I can barely speak. That's really really frustrating compared with what he achieved. The thing is that I can build sentences in mind but it takes time to speak them out. I need some seconds to come up with the right words and then some seconds to put them in order, and again some seconds to speak the whole sentence out word by word. If I am having German conversation with a person, he(she) would need tons of patience waiting for my answer or leave me alone.

			Glad to know someone else has this question....I am actually pretty fluent in Spanish, Portuguese and German, but the use of the Du and Sie form is totally different in each language, and depends upon the country, even within the same language....(Spanish in Spain is not the same, as in South America, especially in relation to the use of ""tu"" and ""Usted"").   
So, is the use of Du and Sie the same between Germans and Swiss? I had this adorable young man as a patient today, and found myself floating between du and Sie for the entire appointment and finally felt rather foolish....help!

			Or, alternatively, visit this   on how you find your language partner. There are not enough French speaking people in our area of EF, that's great somebody showed up to offer a language exchange. Summer is a great opportunity to polish up language skills, people seem to have more time. I am part of one in Geneva, works out great. And, don't forget to pop in the intro section to say hello.

			You can hardly call 2 classes a week as intensive. You might be better off with lessons offered by the commune / Gemeinde, although GVA is French speaking.   
Such lessons are either free, or very affordable. you might also wish to look into RAV providing you DE lessons through an authorised provider ( some reputable schools are on the panel list )   you are eligible. Another option, as a student, is to tandem with a fellow student.   
All the best in your quest.

			Anyone done one of these?  Been here over a year on an assignment but have now localized in Basel. I know if I sign up for regular classes I'll have things come up at work and it'll never happen. Maybe if I take 2weeks vacation from work and do one of those intense crash courses I'll get there faster. Just lookin for some advice from anyone who has done it. Never studied German before. Only French.

			Hello.. anyone have any recent feedback of Benedict Language School? I have only seen a few in the Forum and they are out of date.  I am looking to join an intensive 2 week class from level A1.   
My other choice is Bellingua.     
Prices are only about 70 to 80 difference, however Benefict offers an extra hour each day.   
Any feedback would be appreciated!   
Thank you.

It's also very near the court house and prison. The Reithalle is ""Under new management"" and they are trying to encourage drug free entertainment for young people.    
The original Reithalle were used to exercise horses in, during the cold winters. They are built like very large barns with high roofs. Recently a new one was built at the national horse center near Avenches.

			I studied with LSI some years back.  Firstly, go direct and not through Cactus.  If I recall, my first contact with them was via Cactus, which then bound me into the deals Cactus offer, which were not as good or flexible as going direct.   
I found LSI a mixed bag - one tutor I had was great for me (very structured, grammatical, logical rule based approach to the language), but had a girl in our course near to tears on numerous occasions as he could not appreciate that style wasn't working well for her.   
In other respects I found it frustrating - they were disorganised, sometimes having no desks available for the class.  The afternoon discussion classes were pretty random, and seemed to suit the interests of the tutor better than the student - one guy took us to visits to the Landesmuseum and medical museum, sometimes we watched films (albeit in German, but on a dodgy little TV with crappy speakers).  Found all that pretty unsatisfactory.

Also Wim Wenders ""Der Himmel über Berlin""  
(English: Wings of Desire). It is a wonderful movie. (Don't be put off my the description and don't even begin to compare it to a similar but absolutely awful movie with Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage)

2020	null	null	null	null	"    Hi Lob, I don't actually agree on that one. This happened to me my first month or so, but as I improved my pronunciation and fluency it stopped happening. In fact the opposite happened - many Swiss would then be embarassed to speak English around me, as if I would judge them. I found this most curious. Nowadays I only get the switch to english thing once in a while, usually from someone who is overjoyed at the chance to practice.   
One thing to bear in mind that many expats, even though they work really hard on their german seem to do very little work on their pronunciation. The English seem to have a habit of putting umlauts on all their vowel sounds and refusing to do the deeper sounds such as u and o. Most insist on pronouncing Zug as ""Zoooog"" (as if it were spelt süüg in German). Many Americans seem totally unaware of the rolling ""R"" in German, flattening it and dragging it into a nasal sound which is like fingernails on a blackboard to a native speaker. These dead giveaways simply trigger a response in a native that ""this person is very uncomfortable with German"" and the response would come in English simply out of politeness.   
To think about it another way - imagine you are in the UK and someone comes up to you and says ""vitch vay to bahnhof"". You'd hear the heavy accent and probably answer in German. But if you just heard a light German accent, you'd most likely answer in English.

			Angela   
Have a look at    
I am on my third course.  They are cheap and the teachers friendly and the work books they use suit me  (lots of pics to explain things.  I learn by seeing rather than hearing!)   
It is subsidised and as it is part of the integration service for foreigners, you get a huge mix of nationalities  so of course all the classes are in German but that is nothing to worry about even as a complete beginner.  You can attend courses without living in Baselland but they will no doubt charge more.   
I also recommend Michele Thomas cds to start you off.  Really helps explain things and helps with the pronunciation and reading   
Good luck   
Annie

			OK, I went to the RAV interview today.  They told me I need to be in CH at least 3 months, submit 5 to 8 job applications a month, send them proof that I was denied. After the 3 months, they will pay for the German Language class. In the same school I'm in.   
They also told me, that they have 2,000 people registered jobless ( don't know if in that office or the Canton) and they only find around 50 jobs a month for them, and usually they are low skilled jobs. So I was better off, getting a headhunter or looking on my own than using their services.   
They told me where to get my Bachelor's diploma certified, also to get my social security card (AHV) and some other tips. So I guess it was worth it.    
Good Luck All!

			A hobnocker is a guy who helps when the  saggar-maker's bottom-dropper's mate is helping the saggar-maker's bottom-dropper to drop saggar-bottoms so that the saggar-maker can make saggars with them.    
Sometimes the saggar-bottoms would stick to the stove they were being made on, and so couldn't drop properly (and an undropped saggar-bottom is not a pretty sight, I can tell you).    
Anyway, this guy - who was neither saggar-maker nor saggar-maker's bottom-dropper nor yet the saggar-maker's bottom-dropper's mate - would hit the stove hard with a large stick to unstick them; hence,  .

So, you're from around Hannover?  :-)   
Indeed a lot of 'Swiss German words' are spoken in Germany.  Though it tends to be in the Allemanisch and Schwaebisch areas.   From what I understand, the Bavarian German dialect is much different than that from northern Germany (or at least that's what a friend who is from Munich mentioned).   
One thing that always amuses me is that the Swiss almost always pronounce German placenames in perfect High German.  For example, Weil am Rhein, just north of Basel is pronounced Wyyl am Rhyy by many of the local Germans, but not by the Swiss.     
BTW, in the Basel dialect it's

			I am using the Pimsleur learn German which to learn High German, which is great for learning how to speak, but I'd also like to be able to read and write well, for looking at websites, or sending emails etc. Can anyone recommend a good textbook. As an English teacher I use textbooks like 'Cutting Edge,' and Headway,' with exercises in reading and writing as well as listening and speaking, and they come with a CD. Can anyone recommend me a good equivalent of these for learning German, that is a series of books with different levels, rather than just learning basic phrases.    
I'll start classes when I get to Switzerland but I'd like to make a head start before that!

			Hi,   
I moved here 3 months ago and have spent the last two months studying at the ILI language school and I am desperate to change.   
I would not recommend this school to anyone as all they seemed interested in is your money. If you want more details on my experience there let me know as I am happy to indulge!   
I have heard good things about the MIGROS language school as well but I am yet to try it out.   
I hope this helps!!!   
GOOD LUCK!

Anyone interested in taking a Beginner's Italian course at Klubchule (Scuola Club) MIGROS from May 17? Mondays and Wednesdays, from 20:00 to 22:00. I heard really good things about the course and I signed up, but they need another person to sign up by this Monday in order to decide to run it.    
Please consider signing up if you are near or in Locarno and are interested in starting Italian...

We have to prepare texts in English that are then translated to German or French. When doing artwork we have to allow almost twice as much space for these languages compared to English, partly due to the cumbersome and exacting nature of their grammar.

			I agree with the OP that ""Merde..."" is a wonderful way to learn dirty french. It uses the Michelin 3 star system to indicate the degree of rudeness. Very useful for beginners. My dog-eared copy is lovingly annotated by vulgar speakers of both languages.    
A favorite of mine is : ""chacun sa merde"", literally ""everyone (has) their schitt"". As far as I can tell, it means ""each to his own"", but is much more satisfyingly rude. Improved interpretations welcome!

			Exactly. First I was going to suggest a translator. A text like this (especially towards the end) can easily be misinterpreted.   
Asking readers to give you a reference as to the level of your writing, well, that's something more conceivable.   
It depends, of course, what you want to use the language for. I guess in some contexts, it could be sufficient, while in others not.   
As a teacher, I'd just suggest that you do other things than translate (provided that the text is your work). Sometimes one's mother tongue can negatively influence the output, given the differences between the two languages. Try forgetting about the original language and use the (little or more) English you have. I know its more and more difficult to do as we get older, but it improves our skills a lot if we don't rely on our mother tongue but use the rules and words we know in the other language. And reading similar texts than the one you're trying to write will give you an idea of the phrases you might use   "	slipped a little	Join Date: Jan 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Need help from English Native , pls help proving my writing.

We have just moved to Lausanne. I am a native English speaker with a 3 yr old (who only speaks English). I speak no French and am looking to learn the basics.   
If you are a native French speaker living in the Lausanne area, and you have a child similar in age to mine, please send me a PM!   
I used to run English speaking playgroups for kids aged 0-4 and their parents (so I am used to teaching rhymes, doing story time, engaging kids in various games and craft activities, etc.).   
If you can teach me French (with my child in tow), I can help you with your English or do some fun stuff in English with your child.

			Personally, I like Galileo, on Pro7. It's a science-oriented educational little show, often doing some pretty entertaining, although maybe a little silly, experiments (e.g. which chewing gums resist better to YEARS of mechanical chewing  ).  
Since it has a news-like structure, it's pretty easy not to lose concentration.   
Also for a ground level, I suggest cartoons  . The ones which are meant to preschoolers (say Mickey Mouse Wunderhaus, Winnie the Pooh, Dora, Caillou) guarantee a pretty high rate of understanding since the concepts and words are...well...suitable for toddlers.

In the letter there's written only what I've written here, and five lines in German, which I translated and say only that they found out that I have to pay this tax.    
I took a German class, and my husband's firm should have paid for it. Maybe they didn't recognize the payment as mine...  
I'll figure it out, thank you again!

			interesting! I think German itself goes as far back as Sanskrit, but would need to double check. There were also Germanic tribes ( The Goths ( East Germanic) who died out- only leaving their architecture, right?)  
West  Germanic ( Eventually High German as we know it today) 
North Germanic  ( Swedish/Danish)   
Martin Luther- fascinating guy, did a great job of translating bibles from Low German ( basically Dutch) to High German, and it's because of him we have High German today.   
Have recently observed, how like Dutch Swiss German sounds,  
1. Words like Hoi 
2.dropping of the end of verbs and words 
3. Guttural G,     
perhaps then it is a mixture of Yiddish and Dutch sounding idiosyncrasies, or simply- it is influenced by many influences over time.

			I have the HP6 book and CD's that correspond to your HP1 book and MP3's and yes, they can be used to listen and read along.  The information sheet inside my CD package says, ""Aus dem Englischen von Klaus Fritz. Gelesen von Rufus Beck"".  It also lists the earlier HP CD and MP3 products (yours MP3 product is included) for the Klaus Fritz translated HP books.  So I think you should be fine.  If you want to be extra sure, then I suggest you email your question to the ""der Hörverlag"" at   (go to ""Kontakt"" link at bottom of page).

			Then I'd go for the last suggestion I made; you get the answer you need. 
Expect an answer to be more on the long term though: landlords or parking lots owners look for long terms rental.   
If you are looking for a parking place for the comming summermonths (-vacation), I guess many car owners who go on vacation by car could be interested to rent their parking place during that time. A message on the pinboard at the Migros in your neighbourhood?

			Gosh, what a topic! You're confusing me, and I am German!  
I am trying to think of a simple rule... all I can come up with ist this: 
Strangers are always ""Sie"" unless they are children/teenagers. 
Once you get to know people it gets a little complicated... if your German is good enough you can try and juggle around addressing people. If not it is always safe (but somtimes a little impolite) to use ""Sie"". If in doubt, why don't you simply ask? Coming to think of it, that's what I do (here in the French part), and people mostly respond well.  
Don't despair,

I remarked at lunch that I was understanding most of their conversation, and they replied that because of me they were all speaking high German!

Swiss German is not a written language, it is a spoken language - there are many different versions of the spoken language & even more variations in how people attempt to write it.  Consequently on-line tranlations will never work.

			Hey there,   
I am a 26 year old male from the U.S. who is hoping to expand upon my limited French.  I took it in high school but have since forgotten most if it.  I would be happy to meet a few hours a week just to have conversations with a native French speaker and in return perhaps help them with their English.   
Please let me know if you are interested.   
Thanks so much!

			Well, I saw ""Das Leben der Anderen"" and I enjoyed it. Good movie. But as far as the pedagogy of learning a language by watching a grown up movie goes...eh. It was so frustrating that it took about oh, 2 days, off an on, to get through.    
So I'm sticking to the more comedic suggestions on here.    
My next attempt may be cartoons, Swiss or German. 
Cheers

2159	01.03.2010, 23:28	Junior Member	Thanked 3 Times in 2 Posts	Location: UK/Baden	"    Rules and signs mean nothign to some people. One Hauswart I know well (he and his wife look after a group of small buildings) told me that the state some people leave the laundry room in can be awful.    
What I find amazing is that in flats with specific wash days and sign up sheets, you almost always know who the culprit is. The best thing is to tell the Hauswart and let them confront the culprit. Unfortunately, no amount of signage or rules is going to change the way some people behave.    
It's a real pain when you have to clean up after someone before you can begin washing.   
It's no wonder everyone wants their own washer/dryer. This is becoming more and more popular now and some people are willing to pay that little bit extra for this.    
Other than flats built to be sold, renovated apartments in unusual buildings (without cellars) tend to have their own laundry, as do houses. The advantage of the shared laundry is you have more drying space often with a wall dryer.

			Since we're sharing... posted this one before, but quite a while ago so here it is for the newbies:       
It's the US Foreign Service course, used to to train diplomats before shipping them out overseas.  Don't be fooled by the course being called 'Basic' - it goes from beginner up to a very solid B1, almost B2 level (good enough for free-flowing conversation and almost any situation you'll find yourself in).   
Choose a course (I'd recommend Basic, then after a few months try the Phonology to tidy up pronunciation of those tricky vowels), open up the workbook, then play the associated 'tape'.   
(Edit: Just been reading the forums on the FSI site, and apparently for total beginners it's best to start with the Phonology THEN move to the Basic; if you already have rusty school French you could do it the other way round, which is what I did.)   
It's an old course, from around the 1960s or 70s I think, so don't expect whizzy graphics or fun.  It's traditional learning, with lots of repetition and lots of verb drills.  But it's very, very effective, very comprehensive and totally free!   
kodokan   
PS: There are also lots of other languages on the FSI course, including German and Italian

			Hello Everyone,   
I saw the other thread about people meeting in Zurich on Wednesdays to practice their German and was wondering if anyone would like to meet on the weekend? My thought was Saturday mornings, around 10am, maybe once or twice a month. I have an English playgroup so we could use my space and you can bring your kids along if needed -- plenty of toys for them to play with! It just might be a bit noisy but I think this could be convienient for moms.   
Anyone intererested? My space is located in 8966 Oberwil-Lieli.

I currently have a truly excellent teacher with lots of energy and she is also pretty imaginative.  The school is Hull's school.  The teacher I had before her was not so good.         
In the past I had Lingua-top ( ).  Teh guy that set up the company is an excellent teacher, otherwise I had one excellent and one rubbish teacher from them.

			I agree with the OP that ""Merde..."" is a wonderful way to learn dirty french. It uses the Michelin 3 star system to indicate the degree of rudeness. Very useful for beginners. My dog-eared copy is lovingly annotated by vulgar speakers of both languages.    
A favorite of mine is : ""chacun sa merde"", literally ""everyone (has) their schitt"". As far as I can tell, it means ""each to his own"", but is much more satisfyingly rude. Improved interpretations welcome!

			Hi Kirilisa 
I am a Swiss woman, 48 years old, and looking for an exchange German-English. I would suppose to meet somewhere in the center of Zurich and drink a coffee together; just to take stock of each other and to see, if we are matching for a language exchange. 
Possible meetings: Thu/Wed/Thur/Fri afternoon. 
If you - or other people - are interested write a mail to

			Panda, I work for a Kantonale Berufsschule but not the one in question.  Our school allows 3 trial lessons before committing.  I'd advise to call the Sekretariat and ask if this is the same case.  This will allow you the freedom to decide for yourself if the course meets your expectations or not.

Remember how you learned to chant times tables as a kid, so that merely by saying '5 nines are...' the answer would pop into your head to finish the pattern?  It's just like that - after a while, sentences will just 'sound' right, the way they do in your native language.   
Pronunciation doesn't matter for this, so don't worry overmuch about it.  And make it easy on yourself - stick things up around the house, so you can read out loud little and often.  Our entire downstairs bathroom is wallpapered with articles and kids' comics, and I regularly change what's on the kitchen cupboard above where the kettle boils.   
kodokan   
PS: Just re-reading, and perhaps reading out loud was what MathsNut meant all along.  Never mind, I've typed it all out now, and the wall/cupboard bit's useful.

			It's not specifically French, but I use iVocabulary for learning vocab.  There's a free accompanying Mac program you can use to create your own lists but there are also many lists which other people have created and you can download for free.   
For dictionaries, I used the Oxford Multi-Language Pack Pro, which I use frequently.  For verb conjugation, the Ultralingua dictionary proves useful.

			hello   
i've been a student at both Goethe and GLS in Berlin. Goethe is very expensive relative to the other schools in Berlin, but the teachers are very good and I would rate the course highly.   
Prior to Goethe I was at GLS   which is a lot cheaper and the teachers I had were also pretty good. If i was going back I would probably just go to GLS because its cheaper and at my beginner level its all pretty much the same. You can start any monday from one week up. This is good but also a downside if you're there a little longer as your classmates always change.   
Another option is the volkshochschule, there are branches all around Berlin at its very cheap but i hear the teaching quality can vary. This is the one nearest to me when I was there      
if you're a german citizen there is also some deal where the government will subsidise 600 hours of german language courses at VHS, but unfortunately I didn't hear about it till I was about to leave. I can dig up some details if thats the case for you.

			I think it would depend upon your usage needs...?   
If you are looking to work in some corporate office, it is likely that your needs will be for ""High"" German and English (assuming one is hired from the standpoint that they ALREADY speak English) and then learn Swiss German for day-to-day dealings outside of work.   
ON the other hand - 
If one is working in a ""front line"" position, say a hotel desk clerk, a store sales associate, a restaurant server... I think learning Swiss German first is more valuable as spoken communication then takes precedence over written.

			I suggest you do a quick  since this topic has been covered to death before. Mind you that ""Swiss German"" is not a dialect of German, neither is it the way German is taught or spoken in Switzerland - it's an independant language. But again, don't forget to do that search!

			They usually do give you a test which is aimed to find out at what level of profficiency you are. They are cost free. If you have no idea about German alphabet and never spoke a word I would simply tell them it is a waste of time on both sides. However if you have some basics and you can remember anything, it's good to determine where you would best fit. Sometimes taking A1 level is not fun and you could rehearse entire book in few days.

			I have been going to Ecole Agora (conveniently located along St. Francois) for over 4 months and it gave me a fantastic foundation  
in terms of vocabulary, grammar and pronounciation.    
Price is fair considering it's an intensive course of 3 hrs. everyday... 
they also have some evening classes for those who are working, but $I haven't tried this.

			Hi,    
Does anyone know of a German language teacher in Zermatt - I'm struggling a bit here and could use a boost in the language department. It has to be in Zermatt though, no time to get to Tasch, Brig or Visp!   
Any info greatfully received

(at least in Neuchatel).... a number of products/advertising boards/signs have English catchphrases... eg: a stop sign is ""STOP"" not arrete(sp) or halt....  I think the sheer amount of English catchphrases, pop music, celebrities, movies makes it slightly easier for French/German to learn English that it is for a typical Brit, Yank or Aussie to learn French/German/Italian.

			I would love to do a french beginner class. I have a french O level but that was many moons ago. I'm over for Christmas and then moving out in February to Vevey. I will have two toddlers so need to find out about childcare for them to do a class in day, else it will be an evening but I fear I will find it hard to stick with an evening class. Would prefer day with nearby childcare. The migros site looks to have a lot of courses. Dont know what level I would be. Guess its best to go there for a chat first. Anyone found a class to suit??

For whom? What for? 
A Danish expat teenager in need of mother tongue support does not need the same kind of teaching as an adult total beginner.

			Wow....got to love the law of attraction.      
This just triggered a thought. When I learnt Albanian I did it with an Audio course, that speaks about attracting a language rather than learning it. Funny concept in a way, but wow, did it work!    
Anyway.... lol...don't know why I am posting this here.... Just had to think of that when I read ""law of attraction"".    
Hmmmm... maybe can be of help anyway on what concerns learning French.    
I am a French teacher (for primary school kids that is) and I always find that listening to radio programmes or buying books on cd's can help.    
If you are a beginner then try to dive into the language as well as you can, make sure you surround yourself by it, giving your brain the message: This is important.    
Thinking.... I will go and check whether they have those audios in French too....    
Yep.... they do:    
Hurray...  This may really help you. If it is anythign similar to the one I did in Albanian it is well worth it.    
Other than that playgrounds are great places to learn a language in too. Find French speaking moms (if you have any kids, that is) and off you go.... engage in a conversation...

The dialects spoken in the Alsace, in southern Baden-Württemberg up to Stuttgart, in southwestern Bavaria and in Vorarlberg and Tirol are almost or really the same as the Swiss-German ones. ""Native German speakers"" ?  Depends on where they are from. People from South Germany and Western Austria understand most Swiss German dialects.    
Low German is a term which refers to the ""Lowlands"" of NorthWest Germany, with one of its forms being Platt-Deutsch which sounds similar to Dutch (and even English) but by structure and grammar is closer to Standard German than the South German, Swiss German, West Austrian dialects.    
You remind me of a visit to Leipzig and Halle, where I told a local from Halle that Switzerland was positive about German reunification, but at the other hand could have lived with two, three, four or five Germanies, and also for instance with the Kingdom of Bavaria (having Bavarian as national language). It then was HIS point to be VERY positive about the idea   "	an excellent reputation	Join Date: Nov 2009	Groaned at 20 Times in 18 Posts	What's the difference between High/Standard German and Low German?	eddiejc1	Posts: 982	3,583	1	Language corner

			Hi everyone,    
I had already posted this link before for a person looking for a german lessons in Wintethur, but I thought I would post it in this thread too, because ECAP is also in Basel, Bern, Zurich, Luzern, Ticino, Solothurn, Aargau..   
Some of them have childcare, some don't have it, it depends on wich kanton, but almost all of them have evening courses (2 times per week), intensive courses (monday to friday) and saturday courses.   
Just to give you an idea, in Zurich I attend tuesdays and thursdays from 7:00pm to 8:50 aprox. with a ten minute pause, and the cost for 3 months was about CHF420 (I can't remember exactly) but includes books and CD.   
You can check it out in the website   and use   to translate it if you have problems:

			I will be looking to start a German course in Zurich in January, and wondered if anyone else was doing the same.   
I am a complete beginner ( i know about 3 word and pronounce those badly! so will be starting at the bottom - A1 (unless theres a lower level  ) I just thought I'd check to see if anyone else had the same plan.   
I haven't decided where or when yet, ideally evenings, but as I have no idea what time I will be home from work and most courses seemed to start at 6:30 so I might have to be looking at Saturday mornings instead (good bye Friday - drinking sessions  ).   
Anyway if you interesting in starting a course in January feel free to get in touch. I thought it might make the whole thing a bit easier if theres someone to practice with mid week over a couple of drinks.

			i used to keep a notebook (eventually i migrated to excel), in which i maintained a list of words i learnt. but there were too many to note, so i kept only those i thought were useful/interesting. at the beginning, i would conscientiously go back to review the words, but i never recorded the context in which the word was used, which presented various challenges. knowing what a word meant, did not necessarily mean i knew how to   it. nothing stuck, eventually i gave up. its akin to the german theory of ""logical atomism.""   
then i started doing newspaper cuttings, looked up the words and wrote them on some space on the article (printing off the internet gives you more space). this way, i have a finite number of new words to learn, an article that put meanings in context and sentences that demonstrated its use. it's a mini ""logical holism"" that strings everything together nicely. i file them away for future references, as i know certain words are often used in certain topics.   
when learning new words, i accept that i will forget a good portion of what i come across, maybe 50%. so i just try to do as many cuttings as i can   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	How do you record your vocabulary?	chardie18	Posts: 304	808	6	Language corner

			So I have been here for 2.5yrs. I take my german classes each week and I can get by with day to day situations, and basic converstaion. To be honest I am dissapointed with my progress. I have a Swiss Boyfriend and many german speaking (High and Swiss) friends so exposure to the language is not the issue -- but I work in an English Speaking environment which does not help.   
I know that I need to take an intensive class. Unfortuntaley these are aimed at people who are not working. Taking more then a week off at a time is not an option for me, so I was wondering if anyone has been able to find an alternative intensive learning format. 1x per week is not working!    
Thanks for any ideas or suggestions.

			Hello all, I am looking for a language tandem, here the details:     I am trying to learn German, current level A1   
Mother tongue italian but I speak also english   
I live in Luzern   
I love many sports and travelling   
I am Italian, from the north east part (Treviso, close to Venice). I have been in Switzerland since February 2009 and I came here because of my job (Schindler). I am interested in learning German but I have problems of time, so meeting in the evening once a week would be perfect.

The solution might be to find an English speaker near Geneva (I assume that is where he plans to study) to practice with on a regular basis while his main focus is on studying French.

In German and Swiss German, you will find many words with an ""umlaut"", basically: ü ä ö, like in the word Zürich.   
For languages, keyboards, typewriters that do not have/recognize the ""¨"" the letter ""e"" is placed after the vowel, so it can be spelled, Zürich or Zuerich.   
You will come across this variation very often.

			You are 100% correct, but I find it unusually liberal that everyone can open a school and offer ""MBA"" courses. I was not aware how bad the situation actually is before I found a   here on the forum and had a look at that school. They have the EduQua basic QM system (that even the Zurich hairdresser school has - no joke) and make it appear as a sort of ""official governmental accreditation"". They even offer doctorates! When I googled a bit, they seem to target specifically Indian and African distance students. If those print a ""name, MBA"" on their business card in the impression that they did receive ""the real deal"" for their money they might get into trouble in the EU.

Im a native spanish speaker, and also have a fair knowledge of english, and Im currently taking german lessons but still quite basic..   
So I was wondering if someone native german speaker (high german in this case) would like to meet up once in a while for a language exchange? conversation, etc?   
I can help you with your spanish, correct your pronuntation or help you with your grammar or to improve your vocabulary, and I would like to get the same too, someone who will not let me make mistakes just because 'it sounds cute'   
If you would be interested please let me know and we could set up a day/time that fits both parts, thanks and have a nice week!

Got my Casio G2200 in 2004, it's very handy considering that it carries 5 dictionaries in such a small package. Most of all, (common) word combinations in German are also defined which is practical in the advanced level, when trying to read complicated texts / newspapers on your own.  
It is more expensive than conventional dictionaries at about CHF 400 but it's worth the price..

			I have just started a semi intensive German course at the following location in Baden:     Stephanie Minet     Bahnhofstr. 44     5400 Baden     056 205 61 22       
TLC - The Language Company [info@tlcsprachschule.ch]   
The couse runs for 3 days per week, 2.5 hours per session. They have a variety of start times to suit different working environments.   
I am enjoying the course I have chosen and the group is small (6 people), if that is of any help!   
Good luck!

			hi,   
Is here anyone want to study Chinese? 
My mother language is Chinese and i can speak English as well. 
My intention is to find someone who can help me learn German and i will help him or her study Chinese, therefore she or he shall speak English and German so that we together can do language exchange to help each other.   
It does not matter whether she or he is or not a local person of Zuroch or Switzerland.   
Please contact me: pm me   
Awaiting for your reply.

Generellay, you can do well if you do no tspeak italian. You can do the shopping, and other related things.   
BUT, if you may try to find a job, then the mission becomes impossible. I mean that if you are not extremely good in something, for instance (software programming) and you do not italian, it is impossible to find a job.   
If you need more info, do not hesitate to PM me.

			To save my pedantry hijacking a recent thread I thought I'd point the difference out here. It may help some people who are in need of one or the other, and could help avoid an embarrassing situation where wrong person has been employed   
A   typically translates the written word from one language to another - books, documents - anything that is written. From my knowledge most translators translate in one direction only, normally from foreign language into mother tongue. Of course there are exceptions to this and it is possible to find translators who can work in both directions equally ably.   
An   translates the spoken word immediately, and does so with both languages - typically employed for interviews, discussions, speeches etc.   
Of course the crossover between the two types is large and there are people who work as both translator and interpreter.

I am interested in improving my French, I lived a couple of years in Paris and I'm scared I might lose my French over time.    
About me: I'm from Barcelona so I speak Spanish and Catalan as my native languages. I also speak good English (I lived in the US for 2 years). I came to Zürich to do a PhD at ETH a month ago and I don't really speak German... yet!

			Hi guys,   
I already introduced myself in the introduction topic thingy... 
My first language is German but i am quite fluent in English too - especially orally (no not the kinda oral some of you might be thinking of now :-)   
Anyway as you can see my English is too informal - so that kinda rules me out for helping Germans learn English...   
But I'd love to help some of you guys out in learning German. I already have experience in doing translation work and i can translate from English to German instantly. I speak German without ANY accent but i CAN speak Alemanic (the basis of Switzerduitsch) if necesary.   
So i would like to offer myself as a tutor or translator and since i wanna gain experiences in tutoring 1 on 1 i would do the tutoring for free (for now).    
Maybe you guys also know some place that i could like register or something, so that i might be able to better get into contact with people looking for a tutor or translator (as i fell just posting it here probably won't reach everyone).   
Anyway i guess it would work doing it via skype or whatever... so if ya interested just drop a reply or send me a PM or whatever...

I'd say go for it, given you have a few years to play with and that you're keen. Given you have a little background in French, maybe start just with that, develop some good learning habits, try it out in real life if you can, then start German.   
The languages are very different and you won't confuse them. You should find French easier though, especially to read, with your background in English.

			In German, ""wenn"" and ""falls"" often can be interchanged, but yes, sometimes it's a matter of vibes to know what's appropriate. I think it's very difficult to cast it into simple rules.    
The very same applies to ""if"" and ""whether"" in English. There are cases where there's not even the slightest doubt, but sometimes even my Michigoose, who is a professional writer, isn't quite sure what to use.

			At various times England was invaded by Romans, Anglo Saxons, Vikings and then the Normans. Each left their mark on English vocab which means often in English you have different words which express the same meaning because English vocab imports words from German, French, Latin etc.  
""Invoice"" is derived from the French word   = to send. Envoy comes from the same root. 
""Bill"" probably comes from the Latin   = a document. 
You could also use ""account"" which came to us via the Latin   meaning a calculation, which became à compter, then  in French. Ditto  ""Facture"" which comes from the French ""Facture"" or German ""Faktur""   
At then end of the day it all means the same ......you have to pay up  "	made some interesting contributions	Join Date: Mar 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Bill / invoice	zanskar	Posts: 180	1,985	3	Language corner

			I can't say which is best, but I'm certainly enjoying and getting a lot out of my lessons at Swissing.   
I have a one hour one-to-one lesson every week, which costs CHF125.  I'm aware that this is more expensive than most other schools and I will consider trying somewhere else when I finish this course.  I can't fault the quality of the lessons though.   
One-to-one has worked very well for me as I did have some school German lying dormant in my brain . . . if I suddenly remember a chunk we can skip on to other stuff quickly.

You're right, getting a job in Switzerland without knowing the language will be difficult to impossible. Just in order to make things clear: The daily, spoken language in the Northern/North Eastern part of the country is NOT German but Alemannic (a topic which is discussed in several threads in this forum). Still, if you want to learn High German, I suggest to see the website of   (however only in German, French, Italian, three of the four official Swiss languages). Migros Klubschule is the largest private school in Switzerland, you can learn anything between languages and repairing a car from them, they are very reasonable pricewise, their teachers are some of the best you can find in Willy Tell's own country. The nearest Migros school however is in Thun, quite a bit away from Lenk. To see where they are to be found in central Switzerland, check  .   
If you have additional questions, feel free to come back. The more you post/ask, the more you'll be noticed. The EF is not only a place of knowledge but also an ideal site to make friends. You'll need them here once you have made the jump over the big pond, they can contribute immensly to your integration into a society that is of course quite a bit different from the one that you are going to leave soon.   
Again: Welcome!

			I remembered this question when I saw on the back of a DVD that the sound would be in German Dolby 5.1, English 2.0, etc.   
I then googled a bit and found this blog which seems to explain another meaning of English 2.0       
Examples:   
English 1.x: Compelling melancholy 
English 2.0: Compellancholy   
English 1.x: female bee 
English 2.0: beemale   
Fortunately, this blog (and hopefully the concept), has died off. Phew. Otherwise it would be frightmare. By which of course I mean a frickin' nightmare.

			This is aimed to all mothers (or mothers to be) who have recently arrived to the germanic Switzerland.   
I arrived 2 years ago and for me it was very valuable to attend to a MuKi Deutsch course (MuKi is the short form for ""Mutter und Kind"" so it is German for Mother and Child).  I did it in Bern but I know there are courses like that in Basel and Zürich (at least), you just need to go to your gemeinde and query about it.  You might even be welcomed to attend to another gemeinde (if you can get there in time for lessons and there are places available - of course priority is given to residents of the gemeinde).  The greatest thing is that you take your child along (no matter how young - but the setting is ideal for 3-5 year olds, younger than that and you will need to ask, because it will depend in the number of children there) and they learn through play while you are next door,  in a proper classroom setting.  In many cases you don't even need to take a child along (they might be already in school or you might be expecting it  ) to take part.   
The aim of the course is to provide you enough German: I took the above from:  , but I can tell it was very useful to me.  I also did various ""high street"" language courses (a lot more expensive) but none addressed the pointers above and the MuKi courses did.   
As I said, just go to your gemeinde and ask whether they provide a similar course if you are interested.  Hope this is of help!

			I don't know if any of you may know about this already, but I just found out that some gemeindes may offer subsidised German lessons. The one I will be attending is done by Fällanden and it costs  , once a week for 2 hours. It's an integration initiative for mothers and children above 3, although not everyone who attends need to have a child with them (I'm not sure if they include men in this, sorry). The children stay with their mothers during the first part of the lesson with the idea that they would help the mums because children aren't as easily embarrassed. Later they are taken out to a playroom and looked after. Class sizes are up to 12 adults.   
If any of you live in or around Fällanden, this could be a great option for you. I was told that they still have free places. They start end of Aug/early Sept and here is the link to it:   Funnily enough, the site is in German =)   
And if you don't live nearby, check what your gemeinde might offer. You never know.

			"".I think the difference between ""gauche caviar"" and ""bobos"" is that gauchecaviar was mostly used to talk about high profile members of the french socialist party while bobos seems to be used for pretty much any member of the socialist party with money.   
In France ""bobos"" seems to be used with scorn by right wing politicians (to try to divide the left wing electorate) but I really don't see anything wrong with being rich and being for solidarity in society, on the contrary I think it is very respectable.""   
BOBOS is an expression that is pretty much the same as ""gauche caviar"" but that does not only apply to people belonging to the socialitist party. It is also used against any kind of people well off and who pretend to hold ""social"" or ""liberal"" views. The scorn is not aimed at the money in itself but on the feeling many people have of having been betrayed by the socialist party and the left in general.  
Also it is a criticism of the way of life. For instance the fact that they love living in the heart of cities, in old handwork shops ets, thus rising the cost of living for the lesser of who find themselves having to live further and further away from where they live. The term is much more used in France than in Switzerland, though.

			Hi all   
I'm a native Chinese (Mandarin) speaker with good English skills. I'm looking for someone who could teach me German (High German or Swiss German). In turn I could help you with your Chinese on any level (have already teaching experience). I live near the city Zug. My contact per Private Message.   
Thanks in advance

			Hi Chantal,   
I am not a native English speaker ... but have 4 years of experience in teaching Enlgish. I do speak fluently for 15 years now & I used to live in the U.S (but have a british accent though due to my past 4 years of working with brits only). I am looking for someone who could teach me Swiss German - I speak fluent High German with mistakes in mostly grammar and der/die/das - and I am looking for an ""upgrade"" to Swiss German. I am interested in ""small talk"" in Swiss German, and some comprehension of pronunciation rules, etc.   
If you may want to try an exchange of lessons with me feel free to PM me.

			i'm moving to zurich this fall and i'm looking to improve my french... but as *cheaply* as possible. can anyone recommend any good language schools? i'll be living in zurich, but i'm thinking of taking a course in the french-speaking part of switzerland, hoping to be with people my age (mid-20s or so).... i'm a fan of alliance francaise but it's definitely pricey. i've looked into ecole suisse and compared to other swiss language schools the prices seem okay... anyone have any experiences there???   
any suggestions appreciated!

I would go for private tutoring as this is extremely flexible and very efficient way of studying. 100% of the teacher time is reserved only for you and your needs. Of course this would cost more - something like 1CHF per minute or more. 
And it's worth to try several teachers, because a) their teaching styles would differ (some will suit you, while others not) b) some teachers are not the best ones...   
No matter which way you choose, try to find a tandem learning language partner in order to practice more...    
There are some blogs and podcast for learning French, but for me their usefulness (as a main learning resource) is rather low, as I want to learn the things I want, and not the things that the author of the site wants me to.

			Hi there!    
Just read your posts. And it turns out that I'm looking for pupils.    
Just to give you my background: I was a primary teacher for 8 years and am now studying science of education.    
I'm presently also giving one-on-one german lessons to English speaking pupils here in Zurich. I'm doing this privately because I found that the schools make you overpay and underpay me.   On average over 100.- CHF on one-on-one lessons and I found that they usually don't even use properly trained teachers.   
This is what I charge: 75.- per lesson. If you need more details don't hesitate to contact me on my e-mail (isabatliner@gmx.li).   
I'll be writing a post to give you more details.   
Have a nice day 
Isabelle.

			Hi Sandra!   
How do you find working in the finance industry in Lugano? Congrats, a bold choice for a woman... but then again Russians are smart (don't ask me to play chess with you =)! I'm also interested in entering that field, but don't they expect you to be fluent in German for this kind of rocket sciency jobs in Switzerland? I suppose your everyday routine is based on English (and possibly Italian for the more informal situations in the workplace)... do you ever run into trouble because of the language, or do you feel pressured into improving your German?   
You say your conversation skills are good, that makes me think your self-assessment as A2/B1 is a little understated. Either that or your grammar/written skills are lagging. Grammar is best learned on your own, with a paper companion of a suitable level. Have you tried reading some  Swiss/German publications about the topics that concern you professionally? E.g. for the same company, my uncle used to keep copies of annual reports in several languages (E, D, F, I, as available) for translation purposes.   
Best of luck!

			Hello! If you are taking   homestay courses and would like to know about   the internet can be a good source of info. The charge usually varies with the country. Most of the time it is only after a mutual agreement of terms is achieved that invoices are sent.

			Thanks for the feedback,  
As for Belingua, am reasearching schools, 
Has anyone gone to Belingua, who has already had previous Lessons? 
I did pass the B1 last year, but have largely forgotton most of the Grammar, and am expecting to have to go back a step. Its hard trying to find an intensive course, when you have got to an level with several grammatic holes in it!  
Would greatly appreciate more feedback on this school...yes have searched other threads too.

			Hi folks,   
Based on another thread I was reading, it appears to me there are a fair number of people around A2 level who are potentially interested in hanging out/going out for a drink or snack and practising speaking German.   
I thought of making a Zürich conversation Meetup.com group -- there is already one, but it is shutting down, dunno why -- but instead I have made a simple poll on doodle.com to judge who, if anyone (other than me!), might be interested in hanging out and attempting to speak German (thinking A2/B1-ish), even if badly. Badly is still practice, right??    
Here is the poll, please fill it out if interested. Emails will be hidden, never fear. I guess I will leave it there for a week or so and see what happens if anything...

			Hi    
I have started learning another language (French), and it is as difficult as any other language .    
I am looking for some one with whom I can practice my french. 
I can help him/her for practicing English, or learning Hindi/urdu or Punjabi.

			Hey all, 
Does anyone know TLC Sprachschule in Baden? Especially in relation to their teacher training courses. I'm thinking of doing Module 1 of the DELTA there starting August. The cost is about 2095CHF (and then add exam fee) for face to face, versus the DELTA online which is £350 + £85 exam fee. 
I know the benefits of face to face versus distance, having studied both in the past, but does anyone have anything to say about this school in particular? 
This is the first time Module 1 has run, so I know it might be hit or miss with TLC. The Distance DELTA people have a lot more experiece. So, you can see how I might waver. Anyone with experience of TLC want to chip in?   
Thanks!    
Anyone wants in on a DELTA-esque/ESOL/applied linguistics-ish discussion group from August in Zurich please get in touch. 
All the best, 
Sarah

			I used to have 1-on-1 French lessons at ABC Institute (Mila de Bie), very clear close to the SBB train station. I'd recommend them. (I'm now concentrating on my Germany)   
You can write to Mila in English if you like - her English is very good. I wouldn't say she is inexpensive though.

			We don't expect anyone to learning Swiss German and most probably wouldn't have the slightest clue how you could learn it.  
It's appreciated, however, if you know a few common expressions like 
-Merci instead of Danke 
-Äxgüsi (Excusez-moi) instead of Entschuldigung bitte 
etc.   
And it's probably true that we're happy enough if foreigners speak German, for Germans however, many expect them to at least show the slightest hint of accepting our own ways, so just a word of Swiss-German will be taken kindly.  The reasons for this has probably been explained in many other threads, no reason to go into it again.

			KuniC,  
thanks for your response. If you have been with the same school all these years, it must be good. I was considering taking intensive courses with them in Paris for a month or two, but then my life took an unexpected turn and brought me here to Zurich (which I am very happy about), but I don't want to give up on learning French...  Will look at their website for classes and when it is possible to join. Thanks a lot, again!

			Hi EF'ers,   
I am here now on my 6th week job-hunting holiday and haven't got much of a luck so far   Before my tourist visa expires, am thinking about applying for a student visa to learn German to extend my stay while I look for job.   
I went to Academia (in Basel) to check on their courses, I must say their prices is 7 times more than I would pay to Goethe Institute, Singapore. Its kinda crazy if you asked me   So I wonder if anyone has such a similar situation or if you can recommend any other school (in Basel or nearby) that will offer intensive German courses and is willing to help out on the student visa application. I've check with Migros Club School but they aren't as flexible and their lessons did not meet the requirement of at least 23 lessons per week (required by the authority).   
Would you know if I am able to convert my tourist visa to student visa without leaving the country?   
Thank you all for any advise, and pardon me if this column is the wrong place to post such question    
-Merci vielmal-

			You'll have no problems as you've already got high German.  You just have to surround yourself with natives.  I understand Swiss German perfectly, yet still speak mostly high German, interspersed with the odd bit of dialect.  I have no communications problems.

			You say you are only here for 3 years. I suggest you forget the grammar. Learn the language like a child. Listen to it incessantly. And speak it whenever possible without bothering whether it is correct.   
Do you have a hobby or skill? Then join an association or club to meet others and converse.

			I use the Little Pim DVD's (Little Pim website) which are a set of 3 dvds created for young children.  They are fun and friendly, cover a nice basic vocabulary (foods, colors, shapes, parts of the body, clothing, games, greetings, basic questions and answers...) and my four year old loves them.  Usually put them on while I am making breakfast.  Have noticed a big jump in his French since we started using them.

			Depends on levels and intensity. B1/2 uses Hueber's Deutsche als Fremdsprache Schritte 6. B2 uses Hueber's EM series. These books are Germany-based and make references to German places and regions.   
You could just go to your nearest school and ask to see the book.

			Well, if you're moving to Australia, you need to learn Stryne, not English... and I can help you there, being a native Stryne speaker. Of course, you'd have to come in to Zürich to meet up with me, but I know there are other Stryne speakers in Switzerland.   
Be comforted, though, that even if you can't get any lessons in Stryne, most Australians can also speak limited English.

			I find the English Forum Electronic Translation Service is very good. All you do is create a post, paste in your text and hit the ""Submit"" button.   
About a day later you will get many results back - one of which may or may not be a translation of your text.   
You will also get a number of results either telling you how stupid you are for having posted such a dumb translation request and giving you a link which invariably leads to Google.   
Hope this helps.

			My husband and I are likely to need someone to help us with translation at a meeting in early june. It's a tricky real estate issue and it's possible the meeting could get a bit hostile, too complex to go into the details here. The person needs to be fluent in english and french, diplomacy skills or background in mediation would be an advantage but not a lawyer.

			If you have already done CELTA then definitely don't pay for a grammar course. Just get a copy of Swan's Practical English Usage and away you go.   
That, or as said above, learn it from online sites that cost nothing there are hundreds available.   
The Uni ZH and ETH have a language learning website that has a good resource pool. This link goes to a result list of resources for English Grammar:    
Good luck.

			My daughter also loves ""Der kleine Eisbaer"", which comes both in High and Swiss German. We usually order DVDs from  . 
You can basically order any film or series in the German version from amazon. Most of time you're lucky and get the English original version as well. Mine always get to choose whether they want to watch ""Bob the builder"" or ""Bob der Baumeister""... 
Super RTL has a good program for toddlers in the morning, ""Toggolino"". I usually record it because it has tons of adverts in. 
Toggolino also has a surprisingly good website ( ). My children both love it and it actually does teach them lots. 
Other than that I found that listening to music helps a lot, we are currently doing it with French. Unfortunately I do not have a clue about Swiss German children's songs, sorry.

			Thanks for the useful replies people.   
I am in the intermediate stages of learning Russian so I was hoping for something a bit less painful than that and it seems my assumptions where correct.   
Its actually strange but , in Russian there are many words that are similar to Afrikaans too, possibly owing to proximity between traditional slavic regions and germanic regions   
ie Meubel, Apteek, soldaat, papegaai all have similar Russian equivalents.   
That being said the hardest thing at the moment is trying to find a job in CH. Looks like its getting better but still tough.

			Hi Peeps,   
I'll be in Switzerland for the next 2 months, so would like to learn German. Thought of enrolling with the school, but it's usually a 6 months course. I speak perfect English & Mandarin, so anyone keen on the exchange for German, let me know.   
I stay around Birmensdoferstrasse, Zurich. We can meet up for coffee at the Starbucks around the corner.   
Cheers!

			My partner and I did this in Zürich and the form was completely different. I'm kind of taken aback - although I can understand why - about the part asking how you met - kept in touch - etc.   
For me - a US citizen - once we completed the form I had to have an original birth certificate issued within 6 months - a copy of my passport - a notarized residency statement (showing the my current official residence) was outside of Switzerland at the time - and of course the 300CHF or so in fees. However - we made sure we had all of this information prior to going to the canton office and so when we completed the application they reviewed our documents - made copies where necessary and approved the application on the spot. We actually then chose the date for our civil ceremony that day - and were done.   
All in all it was a pretty easy process -- I know -- a shock, right    
Now we are in Schaffhausen - I applied for my B permit and it was issued 7 days later -- of course it took another 10 days for them to notifiy me it was ready - but overall pretty smooth sailing.   
Good luck -- I wish you all the best.

			The question is what *kind* of charity you mean...   
Some of the options German provides are:   
Almosen  = alms 
Barmherzigkeit = mercy or compassion 
Güte = kindness 
Mitleid = sympathy 
Nachsicht = leniency 
Wohltätigkeit = beneficence (from Wohltat = good deed)   
I'd go for the suggestion made already (Wohltätigkeit ohne 
Grenzen) simply because it has the closest equivalents to 
the English uses (a charity bazaar would be a Wohltätigkeitsbazaar 
in German).   
Second option: Güte ohne Grenzen (it has a slightly antiquated 
tone to it, and is a little treacly - charity 'out of the goodness 
of my heart' and the like - but it retains some of the older sense 
of ennoblement that doing good used to have).

			On Ricardo, you could opt for ""Neuwertig"", which means as good as new.  
However, in the case you describe, I would choose ""Gebraucht"" (= used) and then elaborate in the text the actual condition. This will save you getting bad rep if the buyer is disappointed.

			For those Zurich-living people who are interested in learning French, Alliance Francaise is starting new classes on Apr 27th 2009, and they still have room (I called them to check). Here's class info;       
Study material cost extra on top of that, 48 CHF I was told.    
From what she said A1 is for absolute beginners (no previous knowledge), A2 for slight but very little knowledge. A3 is when you start with future & past, and from there on out I didn't ask, I assume B1 you have some better understanding and can make yourself somewhat understood.

			Hi All,   
After looking a lot on the forum, I realized  we are having numerous replies for the language exchange. But nothing is clear as whether it really works or not.    
So I am posting one more thread for German-English exchange. 
I speak A2 level German and perfect english. So anybody who is interested in some German practice sessions is most welcome. We can meet ones a week over a coffee or beer and can have some fun practicing this difficult language.

			Hi, I agree. Learn High-German. Your son will be fine, but you're the one who's going to have to be able to fill in all the endless forms for everything and understand what they say in the first place and that will all be in High-German.  Once you have the basics then you can try and pick up some Swiss German.   
You'll get by with High German wherever you go in the German speaking area, whereas Swiss German changes from area to area.    
The other thing to consider is how you learn. My daughter has picked up Swiss German from her kinderkrippe but of course, at age four, has no interest in the ins and outs of grammar, whereas that is how you will initially learn.  Your son will learn from hearing and being immersed in it, so he'll pick it up quickly but kids learn in a different way and in a way that is so different to formal  teaching.   
I found the best way for me was to do a combination of class lessons and audio lessons. The audio tapes (Pimsleur) don't explain grammar but get  you talking really quickly while the lessons explained everything and were very complementary to the tapes. Not that I'm anywhere near fluent yet!!   
Good luck!   
Kate

			I am starting an intensive French course a week from Monday at the Inlingua school in Lausanne.  At the end of my first week I will update this post and let you know how it went.   
The course is every morning, Mon-Fri.  The hours will depend on how many sign up for the class.  They take no more than 8 people per class.  If 6-8 people sign up, it is 3 hours every day.  If it is 4-5 people in the class, the class is for 2 hours and 15 minutes.  We are supposed to call on the Friday before the class starts and they tell us how many people signed up.  I think it starts at 8:30, but I'm not 100% sure about that.   
The cost is 350 CHF per week.  You can skip weeks if you need to (which is why I'm trying this school, because the week-by-week enrollment is so flexible).  Anyway, this is dirt cheap compared to the private tutor that my husband's work had originally set up for us.  That person wanted 115 CHF per hour!

I don't know if it's rude or presumptuous, but since German is not my language by any stretch of the imagination, I'd let the German-speaking person take the lead in suggesting switching to 'du' whether or not I'm older than them.

   Thats a good offer and helpful for all expats in the France part of Switzerland              We at awewa could offer you France lessons during the week.

			Thanks for all the info. Do you know what happens with the DW link? It doesn't work to me and I would like very much to find the utilities you describe. Maybe you can help with another hint to do a google search of that...   
Thanks

			Hi, I'm a native speaker and looking to improve my French - still looking for someone to have tandem French-English lessons with?

2546	23.04.2008, 14:29	Forum Veteran	Thanked 837 Times in 412 Posts	Location: Horgen	"    No, that's wrong (sorry...). Eben and ebenfalls have different meanings. Ebenfalls means - as you said - likewise or as well.   
""Die Kinder kommen ebenfalls"" - the children come as well.   
Eben can mean many different things as an adjective (e.g., flat), but when used as an adverb its typically used to reinforce a statement. ""Ja, eben"" then means something like ""Yes, exactly"".    
""Ja, eben, das habe ich dir doch schon gesagt"" - yes, exactly, that's what I've told you before.   
Just ""eben"" alone basically means ""yes"" with a slight qualifier meaning something like ""yes, why are you telling me that - that's clear anyway"" or ""yes, that's what I've said before"".   
Eben can also mean right now like in ""Er ist eben aus dem Zimmer gegangen"". Well, looking at that sentence eben could also mean something different again, but that's getting too complex. I think best is to try listen to when/how people around you use it. Unless you're sure its probably better not to use it to fill sentences since it actually can alter the meaning of the sentence quite a lot....   
Now, the Konjunktiv question. ""Das wäre"" is correct Konjunktiv II Präsens. So, you better use that. ""Das würde sein"" is actually Konjunktiv II Futur (""das würde morgen sein""). In spoken language people will often use würde for the Konjunktiv II, but in writing its better to use the other forms unless they sound very awkward/old fashioned (e.g., Konjunktiv II of ""gewinnen"" - ""gewönne"" sounds strange - better to say ""würde gewinnen"")   
Hope that helps.....

			To be frank, I've been learning languages since I started school as a kid! In Malaysia, Malay, Mandarin and English is taught in school and then there are the other dialects like Cantonese, Hokkien, Hindi, Tamil, and such which people learn at home. So it's nothing new for me (picking up a new language) - it's just a question of how easy it is to be fluent in a language.   
I started learning French when I was dating the hubby. Felt that it would be important and such not for our relationship but for myself, resume/education/career-wise. However, work commitments made it somewhat difficult to continue and I stopped after a year.   
I continued again after arriving in Switzerland only to stop due to my pregnancy and financial issues. Still, I am using what little French I have learnt (basic-intermediate stuff).    
I read French BDs & Swiss newspapers, listen to French music/radio, watch French films and speak to the HB in French at least once a week (or more). When I go out, I try to start off conversations in French and finish them instead of bailing out with a ""Vous parlez Anglais?"". At my ILs (they are French), it's French, French, French so much so that I learn more in the two weeks I spend with them than two terms of classes back in Malaysia.

			Hi Satya, 
I am preparing for a move and was told that if these docs are in English, they do not need to be translated. So assume yours are in a different language. 
Or maybe we were given a wrong info by KPMG. 
Why do you need them certified and by whom? Notary Public? Or any other authority? Swiss or your native country? 
Thanks in advance for clarification.

			Hi all,   
after living for 4 years in CH, I have made up my mind to learn German  (more oriented to conversation then to grammar).   
I'm looking for a private teacher in Basel, primarily focused on conversation, then to grammar, for me and possibly another colleague of mine. 
Ideally we would enroll for 6-8 hours/week during working time to be decided (Mon to Fri, 9 to 18). 
My first aim is to be able, within 5-6 months, to hold a basic conversation. 
Anyway, I'm willing to discuss for an ongoing service (1 year+)   
If interested (or know someone who might be) you can contact me providing reference, price and the other details.   
Cheers

			Many thanks for all the advice and consolation.  Macchiato, this is the first time I've ever done it (to my knowledge!) so I think I'll be OK... treading on thin ice though...   
Yeah, normally if I'm unsure with someone I'm very good about listening to hear what pronoun   use, but this time there was simply nothing to go on.   
I'm supposed to meet with him tomorrow afternoon - that'll be in English - maybe if I get an opening I'll just ask him then.  In the meantime I guess I'll avoid pronouns if at all possible, and use ""Sie"" if I must use something.     
Question: if I ask him and he does say he would prefer ""Sie"", should that also be my cue not to call him by his first name any more (in German)? It's always seemed to me that there's some correlation there... but maybe I'm just perceiving a rule because I so want there to be one.

			Hi   
I think best for you would be to having someone for language exchange and I hope you will find someone    
Because if you find someone older 18 years and you pay for the lessons and this person has not his/her own registered company or is not employed by e.g. a language school where you get an invoice from you are going to be counted as an employer in Switzerland and you are required to register the person by AHV/IV. This is new since 1.1.2008 in Switzerland. ( )   
If you are looking for one to one teaching from a language school, there are several. We at awewa also offer German lessons in one to one teaching or in small groups. Should you be interested in such an opportunity please feel free to contact me.

			Honestly, I think it is better that you take the German lessons when you are already living on the German side.   
I took German lessons at the école-club Migros, and went to advanced 1 level and when I came here I couldn't understand a iota.   
The thing is, people here don't speak german, they speak swiss german, german is another foreign language for them.  Most of them speak it yes, but not all and they speak it in a different way as the germans.   
my teacher in Geneva, was a great teacher, she came from Hannover and had a beautiful accent.   
But it didn't really helped here.   
Now if you want to take some lessons to be prepared, try to find a german student who is trying to give lessons.   
There are usually plenty of them at the Unis or High schools and they won't charge you 100 CHF per hour.

			I'm a Singaporean working in Beringen but I stay in Schaffhausen. I've been picking up the basics of German on my own but finding it tough to get a good grasp of the grammar.   
The thing is that I can probably put together a simple sentence and hopefully get people to understand me. But my limited vocabulary hampers my ability to comprehend what others are saying to me.   
My main concern right now is to be able to converse fluently at work and on the streets. I need to find a way to learn the language effectively rather than tackling it blindly.   
So bottomline is that I'm trying to find someone who knows German well and wishes to improve on their English or Chinese. Hopefully we can help each other out.    
As mentioned above I stay in Schaffhausen so if by chance anyone is nearby do drop me a PM or make a reply here.

			I can't help with hard statistics but I left here in 2001 and came back last year to find a huge change in the number of people using English as their main language in work and coping with everyday life. Mainy of these would be native English speakers and many, many others from every continent of the globe who use English as a second language.

			Thanks, Sarah,   
After a little practice, I'm sure I'll have some practical questions for you!   
I am already quite familiar with Translator's Cafe and Proz. They're great resources! (I have a few contacs on Proz from years back.)   
Right now, though, I'm really looking for some practice in a professional setting - specifics that one only learns first hand, on the job.    
Best,

			Hi Geman78,   
I just found out that Gampel is by no means close to Thun. While I appreciate your offer, I am afraid it's not that easy to meet. By the way, I am not a native English, your English is probably better than mine. But if you happen to be in Thun or Bern, pls send me an sms. It would be nice just to meet and have a coffee together.   
Good luck with your move!

While posting I looked   up on   and, clicking on the   link was led to the   which described it as a neologism  .

			Hi,   
I have been staying in Baden AG for a few months and am currently taking German lessons. I find, however, that I need more speaking practice than I get at the course. Therefore, I´m looking for somebody with a good knowledge of German (doesn´t have to be native) to meet up for some German talk. In exchange I can help you with your English or Swedish for conversation, grammar or whatever you´d prefer. I am a native Swedish speaker, have a master´s degree in English as well as a teaching degree.  
I am 28 years old, maybe you are about the same age, with or without kids. I would prefer to meet daytime so it would be best if you don´t work full time.    
Please PM me if you or somebody you know might be interested in this!

I am looking for someone in Luzern to give me 1 on 1 German lessons, my level is intermediate, i can hold a good conversation but my grammar isnt great.   
I feel if i go into a group class i will be good at some areas but way behind in other areas so a private tutor would be best for a few months.   
I think 40-50CHF per hour is reasonable to pay ?

sounds like you and your son are having a good time getting him settled in school! 
I found that my son (he's only 4, though) has picked up an impressive amount of French by being with his maman de jour and her 4 year old son. He can talk about knights and aeroplanes now, and I don't understand the half of it! Maybe you can find him a friend who can teach him the essential boy vocab? I have also seen some good picture books on all kinds of topics called L'imagerie, but I don't know if you are too grown-up for them at the age of 9. 
PM me if you would like to meet up for a cup of tea and a good rant... 
Good luck for your talk to the teacher!

However, to benefit these free courses, you should be officially registered as an un-employed person in Geneva. This means that you must have been working minimum 18 months, and then lost your job. If I understand your situation, you just arrived. So, unfortunately, you will not be able to benefit these free language courses.

			I had this when I went to do a French course in zurich (with the uni!) I was expecting that the teacher would be speaking all the time in French - even to explain things to us as that is how it's always been in my language courses. But he never even tried to explain in French, always in SG! I tried to follow as much as I could but when I didn't understand, someone else in the class explained to me in English. Was quite annoying when he gave us vocab lists to learn though..had to translate from german to english before I could understand the French!

And it is certainly easier when you have people coming back with answers like this to help you on the way.

			I'm looking for someone/a company in the Zurich area who can translate a page of handwritten Arabic (written in Egypt -I don't know if that makes any difference) into English for insurance purposes.    
The insurance company have said they will reimburse the translation fee so I don't mind what it costs as long as I get a receipt. (They have also tried to translate it themselves but say the writing is illegible.)   
Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

			My daughter was 8 when we moved to Vevey. She did not speak French, but I had spoken French to her (I am French), so she'd heard it. It took her about 6 months at school to learn the language. During her first year at school she had one-to-one classes with a teacher to accelerate the French learning process. What I mean to say is that your daughter does not necessarily need extra French teaching. But, of course, it will hurt it she gets extra teaching.

			I've just completed a four week level A1/2 intensive course at the Migro Klubschule in Oerlikon. It was really good, I learned a great deal. Met some fantastic people and the teacher was especially good. I would say that the class went very fast and I feel I need a month out to go over what I have learned to really understand it and get my head around it.    
I would highly recommend it to anyone.

			So, i have almost completed my 3rd week in the school of Migros. It's basic but hard anyway as I have never studied another language before and never knew what I was letting myself in for.   
It's complete immersion, that is to say, they don't speak in English or anything (unless they are pushed to if you don't know what the hell they are saying ) I mean, it's the only way it can possibly work, there a people in the class from all different parts of the world, 12 students in all and has now decreased to 10 due to reasons unknown.   
The first week flew by, I was learning numbers, verbs, how to introduce myself, where i work, that kind of thing.   
2nd week, we were learning how to put verbs into practise and use them like you would in an everyday conversation. My girlfriend put post-it notes on everything in the house to explain what it was which was a huge help because it meant i was not slowing the class down by having to look into the dictionary all the time to translate a word.   
3rd week and I can already tell a passing chav how ""sorry I am that I cannot give them a cigarette"" which I was immensly proud of    
The learning experience there has been strange and gives you a great injection of the being able to grasp the basics, now they are asking me to do the 2nd level which i will be declining because of the amount of resources available to me on the net and also with help from family and friends.   
In a nutshell, i have found that, even though i am learning with Migros, I am learning pretty slow, you can only learn as fast as the rest of the class are capable of and 1000 chf is quite a lot to shell out considering what you get out of it.   
I will use Rosetta Stone again after I have finished the schooling, it is pretty good but i am extremely glad I took the lessons (so far)  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2008	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Rosetta Stone	lee1000	Posts: 56	2,122	11	Language corner

			I have just bought a German linguaphone course on ebay.co.uk.   
As I was searching I found a French - Rosetta Stone - version 3 - levels 1,2 & 3 for auction.   
It has 18 hours left, currently at £55 I think.   
Just thought I'd mention it, seems like a bargain.   
Search  'rosetta stone language discs' to find it.

			This is the mother of all free online language courses:    
My link is to the French page, but there's a German course down the menu on the left (and tons of other languages).   
It was originally devised for American diplomats being sent overseas, and is designed to go from complete beginner to reasonably fluent coversation standard.   
It's veeeery thorough, to the point of 'gnaw your own foot off to relieve the tedium'-ness, but very, very good, as it makes you repeat the same phrase over and over, with slight variations for conjugation, noun and so on - 'I have a dog, I have a car, he has a dog, they have a car' sort of thing. There are little dialogues, where you first hear the whole thing and then take the different parts within it, as if you're having a conversation.    
I have a lot of French learning packs and out of all of them, bought or free, this is the one that gives me the best workout with actually speaking the language, over and over, until my mouth automatically knows the shape of the words and phrases.   
To use, first open the workbook for the required level (takes a couple of minutes, it's nearly 500 pages) then have it on the screen whilst you listen to the various 'tapes'.   
In the French section, there's also a 'Phonology' course, which takes the language to pieces sentence by sentence, word by word, syllable by syllable, and is immensely useful for improving pronunciation and accent.   
Hope this helps.

			I was away for the w/e and am just catching up.  I wanted to post some of the schools and people I called last week in the greater Zurich area.  I've narrowed it down to 3 and will make my decision after discussing the materials they use.    
Anyway here's what I know which I want to share but remember that its all subject to change as time passes:     
Stadelhoferstr. 10 
Haus Olivenbaum 
8001 Zurich 
Te. 043 268 8787     so I didn't ask their price.     
Am Bellevue 
Theaterstr. 12 
8001 Zurich 
Tel 044 254 2070   
Swiss German private lessons CHF 96 for 45 minutes, in addition to a CHF 90 fee (I think like an enrollment fee.)     
Zeltweg 50 
8032 Zurich 
Tel. 043 268 0313   
Sorry I didn't write anything in my notes for this one and now after 3 days I can't remember why      
Universitasstr. 86 
8006 Zurich 
Te. 044 350 3344   
Private lessons:  90 min. CHF 172; 1 hour costs CHF 115; 45 min costs CHF 86     
General-Willie-Str. 21 
9001 Zurich 
Te. 044 201 5600   
Private lessons 1 hour= CHF 105. 
Semi-private (2 people) 1 hour CHF 57.     Tel. 041 740 1144   
Private lessons 1 hour=CHF 108; 45 min CHF 81. 
(Thanks moosealot! - I spoke to him and like him)     Tel. 076 410 1313 
e-mail  
(Thanks to the member that e-mailed me his info - I e-mailed him and he responded with an e-mail in German which I liked and will respond to this morning.) I have to confirm pricing with him and will come back when I do.       
Group lessons up to 4 people 
Private lessons CHF 50 for an hour 
She has prepared her own materials.   
I'm probably either going to go with Swissing, Harry or Peter  - fwiw.   
You can see that the range for an hour-long lesson on the wide side is between CHF 50-115.  The middle ground is between 80 and 100.   
Please do your homework and don't make the mistake I did.  
Good luck!

			It's not a conversation group, but if you want to practice your English speaking skills regularly, then you could try a club such as Toastmasters. There are 12 clubs across Switzerland including a few in Zurich:   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Conversation with English Native Speakers	cbzürich	Posts: 1	1,203	1	Language corner

			Quite possibly you are already trying this but just in case I would suggest calling the international school in Basel; they might well maintain a list of tutors in the local area, or possibly some of their English teachers do some tutoring on the side.        
(I don't have any links to the school, just a thought. I have seen international schools in other parts of the world help out in this way.)

			Hi everyone,   
I'm looking to improve my French with a conversation partner to practice with. Ideally I'd like to meet with someone who has young children as I have two children under 2yrs of age! Then they could play together whilst we chat   
If you're a native French speaker and would like to improve your English we could do tandem learning.   
Many thanks

			Hello All!   
I am searching for a German tutor to start in late August or September. I have finished the A1 class at Migros clubschule. Pay is negotiable or/and an exchange for english lessons is also possible. If anyone else would like to join the tutoring lessons that is at the same level as I am, I think it would be a good idea! A small group is always good for learning and interacting! Please PM me to let me know if you are interested.    
Thanks!

			Hi, and thank you for the quick response.     
I am a native English speaker (born in Germany, but grew up in Australia and now live in England.  Been speaking English all my life, and I think I could be a useful practice partner.   
My French is adequate for reading and also conversation, but I still make a lot of mistakes and need to build up speed and gain more confidence.  Ideally I would like to improve my skill to greater fluency, so as to be able to work in a French-speaking environment.   I am taking some conversation  lessons every week, but I would like more practice.  My main interest is in being able to communicate more fluently in French, and I feel that practice is important, but grammar also.    
I expect it is similar for you with English, so if you want to meet up and see how it goes, please send me an email to  .  I normally go home to England of Fridays for the weekend, but I am in Zurich the rest of the time.  I will be in Zurich until December, though they might renew my contract again.

			Prego means ""you are welcome"" and ""please"", exactly like ""Bitte"" in German.   
prego as a verb would be the 1st person, present tense, of ""pregare"" (to pray) 
I pray in the church = prego in chiesa 
pregare is also a politer/formal way to say ""to ask"", that is the ""si prega"" form. 
""si prega di non fumare"" = literally ""it is asked to not smoke"" = no smoking, please 
la prego di sedersi = I ask you to sit down = sit down, please

I would like to know if anyone is interested to join me (two to one) for a German class with a good teacher in Basel. I have had the introductory lesson from her and feel much confident in her teaching, but unfortunately it is very costly for a one to one session. Hence would be happy to find my german learning twin here. 
I can only come for the evening classes as I am working during the day. 
Timing: Tuesdays 7.30 pm 
Price: 68 CHF (2x45 minutes).   
Danke!

I have desperately been looking for a Russian tandem partner so if you are still interested... let me know. Once or twice a week would work out perfectly well for me and I can help you with French, Italian and German. Do you still need someone for tandem? If not, would you know of a Russian friend who might be interested?   
Looking forward to reading you,

Whilst i agree about the Züridütsch with you as being to quick and often like a staccato , I am a Bernese, I rely on lipreading mostly and I find my dialect not particularly difficult, I am lipreading in H Ger ,English and French as well and don't think them either as difficult at all, thus I conclude that it has a lot to do with personal adaptibility and ability.   
For some it may help to book a course with the local Schwerhörigenverein,whereas for others who really struggle it may be easier to switch to High German alltogether.   
I am one of these persons who never had trouble learning or understanding a new language ,but I can not calculate well nor am I any good with numbers in general...... and I know the opposite to this exists as well  I think it has to do with the brain which half of it is your stronger one.

2728	18.07.2008, 20:37	Junior Member	Thanked 12 Times in 9 Posts	Location: Thun, Berne	"    Surely there are others more qualified than me, but my experience might still be of some value...   
I am not fluent in either German or Swiss-German, but what Swiss-German knowledge I do have is built squarely on a foundation of High-German, which IMHO is very helpful, if not downright necessary.  My admittedly limited Swiss-German knowledge and skills have otherwise come mostly from as much ""immersion"" as I've been able to get.  Lots of listening and repeating (and plenty of ""not getting it"").   
Since my initial post-classroom ""immersion"" in both languages during two consecutive summers in Winterthur, I've spent more time in the U.S. than in Switzerland, so it has been a struggle to prevent losing what was gained.  But I have found a few Swiss films on DVD, as well as both   resources, that have allowed me to keep something of an ""ear"" for Swiss-German, and even build some vocabulary, as I would eventually like to return and live there for at least a few years. As you're already there, I think you have access to a much wider selection of resources and tools.   
It sounds to me like you've got more of an advantage than you may realize, with opportunities to listen to, converse with, and learn from other members of your own household.  My family just tolerates my efforts at Swiss-German, though some are interested enough to learn and repeat words and phrases.  But by being there and taking advantage of the opportunities and examples available to you, I think that with patience and perseverance (and as much ""self-immersion"" as you can manage) you can   reach a place where you can adequately communicate in Swiss-German.   
Best wishes for a successful learning experience!

I would suggest that you try & get into a tandem learning situation where you can speak German & your correspondant speaks English, this is basically how I learned initially & after that, total submersion, due to romantic situation ...

2742	30.08.2006, 13:17	Forum Legend	Thanked 2,220 Times in 1,324 Posts	Location: Appenzell	"    Your question was whether it was present or perfect? The answer is ""present perfect"". If it were past perfect then both verbs would be in the past - ""I had brought my book with me"", but your sentence indicates that something has ""just happened"" so it is kind of still in the now, even though it refers to the past, hence the term present perfect. Present perfect can also be called ""perfect"" and past perfect can also be called ""pluperfect"". Confused? Excellent    
I agree with Wombat's comment except that ""Ich bringe das Buch mit"" could be used in other situations other than if you are walking towards someone with a book. This is called present continuous in English and would be ""I am bringing"", however present continuous doesn't exist in German, so we use ""Ich bringe"" instead. As well as potentially having a present continuous meaning it could   indicate a habitual action - ""(Jeden Donnestag) bringe ich das Buch"". More importantly it could also indicate a  action - ""bringe ich das Buch"" could indicate that you are going to bring it later.   
Please note that this use indicating the future is not strictly correct. If you look in a grammar book you'll see that the future tense should be ""Ich werde das Buch bringen"". Unfortunately nobody seems to have told any native speakers that they are supposed to use werden in a situation like this, so you'll almost always here the future tense formed without werden in this case... For example - you'll almost always hear ""Ich gehe"" to mean I am going to go. Correct would be ""Ich werde gehen"", but you'll almost never hear it being spoken that way (in either High or Swiss German).   
Hope you aren't more confused that when we started       Agree with Wombat on this one - just wanted to expand a little. Just remember this little joke. A german walks up an Englishman and says ""What for a dog have you?"". The Englishman is puzzled and has no clue with the German means. But if we literally translate and have the same word order we get ""Was für ein Hund haben Sie?"" - In this case the ""What for"" or ""Was für"" means ""what type of"". Note that ""was für"" is two words. Wofür, Wobei, Woran are single words and are questions where the answer can also be paired as ""Dafür, Dabei, Daran"" - I'm guessing you'll get to these later on, but for the moment just remember ""Was für"" to be ""what kind of"". Remember the dog joke - it helps       I agree with Wombat, but I would probably shorten it slightly to ""Hab' ich nicht verstanden"". If said quickly and naturally then the missing ""das"" doesn't sound bad.   
By the way - the good news is that English and German tenses almost map exactly to each other - so once you learn the terminology to describe each tense you can apply those terms in both languages.

			Hi everyone,   
I am looking for a tutor in German for my girlfriend in Zurich, starting from the middle of July 2008. Her goal is to pass the German entrance exam of the university of Zurich, thus she will be attending extensive classes which are intended exclusively for preparing to this exam and are conducted by the University of Zurich. My girlfriend is a real hard-worker, she is very motivated, and we estimate that she will need something like 3 lessons a week with a tutor for a period of one month.   
So, if any of you give private lessons in German or know someone who gives those lessons, please contact me. It is recommended that this tutor will be familiar with this exam or have experience with preparing students to such tests (this test is in the same level as the C1 exam of the Goethe institute).   
Thanks everyone in advance.

			Hi all,   
I've just started a full time job in Basel, meaning I now don't have time to continue with German lessons and am considering taking private lessons rather than going to an evening course.   
Anyone have any advice on where I might find a private tutor?     
Thanks 
Nikki :-)

			Hello, I could give you lessons in the German language. I`m a German author and Personal Coach/Consultant and I would be willing to go to Switzerland for a while to teach you German, if you like. What are your expectations, for how long would you like to get teached, I mean for how many hours each day and for how many weeks or months all together? I probably could start with it in the end of June.

2773	05.06.2008, 16:29	Member	Thanked 3 Times in 3 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Back to the actual post...What is intensive for you? Here it would normally be 4 hours per day (a la Migro), semi-intensive might be 3x per week. Neither are vastly subscribed by high level proffessionals because they dont have that much time. So once per week is standard. If you are already working at a bank, they should be offering you courses anyways...   
I have taken a course with these type of people (swissing.ch), but also have to say the experience was underwhelming. There was far too much chit-chat and too little actual german learning for me. I was far happier at Migro Klubschule with the Brazilian housewives and RAVies - and they are up for socializing, don't expect many english ex-pats - but you want to learn German anyways    
Also professionals are too busy (or think they are) to be doing a huge amount of smoozing with their german classmates, and the high level ones will either already know german or be taking private lessons with a flexible schedule.

			If my application to Novartis is successful, we may have to consider upping sticks and moving to Basel. However, for the moment I'd rather not as my daughters are still in primary school and the eldest will be entering the 5eme year, where things start to get pretty important prior to CO. Should the commute turn out to be too much and we have to move, will my girls be able to continue their Education in French in Basel? There is a German-speaking school here in Fribourg (obviously being a bilingual canton) and I was wondering if there was the equivalent in Basel. 
Cheers, 
Paddy

2781	18.10.2007, 06:26	Junior Member	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: USA	"    I can see your friend's point. It's kind of what I was trying to get at with the comment about there being benefits from standardizing languages instead of perpetuating patois. And it's not just the political unity of China but also the cultural unity which is huge. Even the most independant minded Taiwanese I worked with still regarded themselves as part of a ""greater"" Chinese cultural family. As for China itself, centralised rule, an iron fist and Confucius also probably had a hand in keeping China together. The other thing is the language was free from outside influences, as was Japanese, for hundreds of years. That helps maintain stability of language. Unlike poor old English which was changed for ever after the Normans came. But if Chinese stayed basically the same down the centuries (I take his word on it) then presumably it was because the culture was stable so it remained a relevant, living language. It must have adapted some over the years - new vocabulary for new ideas (communism for example and ""capitalism with chinese characteristics"") etc. What's interesting is how languages ""move on"". If you listen to Welsh tv  you hear english words for modern stuff. Same in Japanese - the Japanese for hamburger is ""hambagga"" and they have a special alphabet to write words of foreign origin.

My understanding is that not all of the actors portraying the Swiss characters in the film were natives of the Zürich area, and since they were ad-libbing the Swiss-German from a German script, without knowing which of them was actually from Zürich, there's no certainty that their   would accurately or consistently reflect authentic  throughout, if at all.

			Are you already a qualified English teacher?  It might be a different situation if you are.  I seem to be just getting round to something that students do in their gap year and i'm in my mid-30's!

I dont have any paid in school work experience, but have lots of volunteer, student teaching blocks experiences, and as a Early childhood Educator I have also worked in Child Care centers in Australia and Canada.

			Great to see that so many want to learn (Swiss) German. Actually, I'm a bit overwhelmed with all the replies I've received.   
@ Mikey: I'm looking forward to discussing the latest make-up trends with you    
@ JenniferD: That sounds good. I think it's best if we correspond by PM for further details.   
@ lorenzogolini: I'll send you a PM.   
Don't forget, there's also a German Conversation Event on the 15th of April, details  .

			Hi Nate,   
I took German lessons at the Ecole Migros. No real complaints, although I must say that learning German in a French-speaking place is obviously a bit more difficult. Our classes were all held in German only, but the materials all had French translations (which is okay for me, but might be a problem for you, depending on your French.) The bigger problem I found is that francophones have a very hard time pronouncing German correctly (they can't pronounce -ich ,-ach, and similar sounds) and I didn't find practicing speaking with my classmates to be particularly productive. I ended up doing most of my learning on my own.   
You might do well to go with a private tutor, seeing as you already have some background in the language and might need something more tailored to an anglophone. I'm afraid I can't offer any advice on that, but you might wish to search the forum for information on learning French in Lausanne. This will at least provide you with more information on the various language schools here, or how to go about finding a tutor.

ESL, Migros and even with individual trainers, but since I know Jean-Francois and Anne Marie from Ecole Agora I only suggest them, I met both already 9 years ago in Geneva where they worked before they started their own business in Lausanne. My wife is from Russian and within 6 month she mad excellent progresses. One of my colleagues moved from Bresil to Switzerland with his family without any French Background and after 3 month Saturday classes we had already very good discussions in French. Ecole Agora mad a very good Job.   One of the key factor for this success is, they are the owners of the business not only paid teachers, the other is the special way to teach.      Its your joys and its also a question where you are located.     - Check the Schedules (Saturday, Evening and Day classes) important if you are working    - Check the Prices   - How long are the lessons     If you have other questions please contact me but any how have a good start in Switzerland.    	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Mar 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Where to find good French Lessons/Institutes in Vaud?

			The Engrish language is in a constant state of flux, how can one spelling of anything be correct or not.   
Otherwise it'd all still be ""The"", ""Thou"" and ""Whence"".   
FWIW: ""communication"" is the act, ""communications"" is the means.   
(Hmmm, I guess this is still doesn't cover the word for a set of communication, maybe it does?!)

			The resources state above I have found are very good, with Leo and the Pons or yellow German/english dictionaries (langenscheidt).     
If you need more of a beginner's level, I have this wonderful one that really helped me out when I first moved here and it's a Visual, German/English dictionary.  This is more for the complete beginner since it doesn't have allot of more specific words and terms I needed later,  
also Hueber has a wonderful resource of German learning material as well as Pons.  I have the ""Grosser Lernwortschatz - Deutsch als Fremdsprache""; which is a big English/German vocabulary book with Thesaurus which divides vocabulary into different subject areas (topics).  They also have it in German with other combinations, I think French/German, Italian/German, etc....   
Good Luck...

And even if she doesn't speak German by then, she'll learn in no time. And she won't be the only child in her Kindergarten class that doesn't speak German, I can promise you that. 
As I said before in other threads - if you'll be staying in Switzerland for the long haul, send your daughter to a public school - the public school system here is excellent. If you'll be leaving again in the foreseeable future, send her to an international school - but don't expect her to integrate well if you choose the latter.   
As your daughter speaks French, she'll have an advantage over the other kids in Primary School which she can use to make up for her deficiencies in German (if she still has any by then, which I don't think is likely).

If you just need to be able to converse with people, then no one really cares whether you say le or la. They'll still understand you. I'm having to learn both French and German (and Swiss german) simultaneously because half of my husband's family speak swiss german, the other half French. It is possible. Just be aware that every now and again the words will come out in the wrong language!   
If you are continually using German e.g. for work, then I don't think it will be too much of a problem to learn French as well. If you don't use German day to day, then you may have more problems.

			It is possible to pick up a dialect, or a rough approximation of one, or at least a similar accent that people can understand. It just takes time and a bit of effort - and sometimes not as much effort as you would expect.   
For the last three years I was working in the Netherlands and living in Germany. Everyone in NL wanted to speak English with me, despite my many requests/demands to learn Dutch - at first this was helpful, but after a while you couldn't help but feel that they wanted me to simply help improve their English. But I eventually managed to get by in Dutch.    
But since I was switching back to German on the weekends, my German gradually changed without me knowing it. I think largely due to me eventually absorbing how the Dutch intonate. So eventually, many Germans thought I was Dutch (previously, most thought I was English) and many Dutch could understand my half-arsed attempts at their language.   
After that experience, I don't see why Swiss German should be any different. I think you first need some sort of basis in German - it doesn't need to be fluent, just a basic level of understanding. Then you just need to listen to people speaking Swiss German - HOW they say things is just as important as WHAT they are saying. Find the rhythm and try to adopt it.   
You can't force it. I've tried that, and it simply doesn't work. Just relax and try to go with the flow.

			I suppose I am. I have to be sure of the school and its teacher(s) since it is funded by the organisation who expect a certain level of proficiency within a certain time frame. Never did pay or have anyone pay for any of the 3 languages I speak as it was all picked up along the way without pressure.   
The positive part is that people here make it easier by rather politely correcting my mistakes in pronunciation and attempted speech generally.   
Thanks for the advice Uncle Max.

Same here and honestly it gets on my wick when people say that Swissgerman is not a written language.   
Granted that there might not be a general Thesaurus covering all the grammatical rules and acting like a dictionary,but there are quite a lot covering several dialects.   
Ever heard of Jeremias Gotthelf who used a mix of high german and Swissgerman in his books, or Rudolf von Tavel who wrote book after book in Bernese dialect more than hundred years ago.........and whose writing (e.g. grammar and spelling) was a sort of foundation for many others to build up on.   
Only because the dialects are not used as official languages, doesn't mean they are not languages in their own right   
*** step off soap box   
feel free to get in touch with me by PM if you want to have something in SWISSgerman written or translated

			You could try volunteering on a farm in Germany. I know someone that came over from Canada knowing very minimal German, went to work on a farm where they knew even less English than he knew German, and he very quickly became skilled at German - he didn't know all of the grammar rules perfectly but he had no problem talking to people and understanding what they said. There is an organization called WWOOF ( , which is in English and German, similar organizations exists in many countries) who can put you in touch with organic farmers who are looking for people willing to work in exchange for room and board. Because you don't get paid, you don't need a work visa, but if you are non-EU then a tourist visa may be necessary. I believe most farmers expect a minimum commitment of two weeks.

			Hello everyone,   
I came to Zurich about 3 months ago and I started to learn Deutsch. As I only use english in my work I don't really improve with Deutsch. I don't practice too much so I would like to know if somebody would be interested in teach me Deutsch. As I am from Spain, if somebody is interested in learn spanish, we could meet and speak a bit of Deutsch and then Spanish.    
Do you know somebody interested on this or where can I find it??   
Thanks a lot for helping me, I found this forum really usefull!!

			SOS! Does anybody know if there are books or CDs or internet course for a Bernese dialect? I took the biscuit of all idiots giving my Swiss neighbours a word to learn Swiss German. I couldn't help doing it, they were so charming and promised to learn English specially for me. I've found a few books and Eurotalk CD-Rom, but they are for a Zurich dialect. A thought about them speaking English fills me with despair. Yes, I can begin studying high German, but it won't be so interesting.

			i thought it was the other way around... ie. if you have problems that need to be done at the time of the assessment, you have to pay that. Then once you sort that out, they pay in the future. thats how I understood my the letter I got. When I went to the first assessment, i needed to get a small filling. They didn't pay that but should pay moving forward.

I know that at the place where I study translation, the English profs have various degrees- one has a BS in something, one has an MA in French, and one actually does have a PhD in English language and/or Linguistics. And don't just look at the ones in the area where aou live. Chesk alllllll over the country, because you might have to commute.

			I've got one of those Franklin ""Deutsch Professor Pro"" German-English devices.  It's pretty cool.  Recently I found an add-on module for French-English, though it was a bit hard to find here in Switzerland.  Mostly you just have the options of German and (French, English, Italian or Spanish).  The MediaMarkt in Sihl City has a huge selection of these devices.   
They're not terribly cheap, at about 200 minimum for a reasonably decent one.  Then again, it's way easier to carry than a dictionary.  The one I have has roughly 5,000,000 entries.  It's even got some of the more colorful terms in it. ;-)  These devices also have the advantage that you can look things up way quicker.  The only disadvantage is that you can't just sit back and read random pages.

			Yup, the procession starts at 12 and winds it's way through Arth to Goldau, returning to Arth at about 3:30. At least that what's the flyer seems to indicate.   
And yes, judging by the looks we sometimes get from our neighbors, it seems like we are the only expats in Arth...my husband is here on a year assignment, and we figured we might as well live somewhere completely different from where we usually live. And Arth certainly is a far cry from San Francisco! Despite the occasionally ""earthy"" smell that wafts through the open windows on hot days, it's really lovely here. We spent the summer hiking all over Mt. Rigi, and jumping in the lake on days it wasn't raining. It isn't too far/long to Zurich or Luzern, but sometimes I do miss city life. I feel lucky to be living somewhere so beautiful, and also lucky to have someplace to San Francisco to go home to    
So anyway, if anyone wants to venture out to the sticks to see how the other half lives, swing on by Arth this weekend! We'll be the Americans trying to control the dog from lunging at the cows...

			Hello,   
For English-speaking expats seeking German lessons in the areas of Zurich and Zug, I would recommend Soft Landing (Language Training for Expats). The director, Harry Fuchs, can place you and the teachers speak English. They will come to your home or office. I know Harry personally and I think his language program is great - and he has over 20 years experience as a teacher/teacher-trainer and language school director. Try   for more information, or call 041 740 1144.   
Good luck!

			Don't worry too much abouth the are.   
At my high school (gymnasium) in Denmark, there was and American girl doing one year (year 11 afair). She did not know any foreign language before she came, but she lived with a Danish family and passed both written and oral Danish test at the end of the year.   
OK, Danish is simpler than German, but anyway.   
The main problem is if kids arrive much later thn that to a Swiss school. If they start aged 10 or 11, they just do not have the time to get their German good enough by the end of year 5.   
And if they are not deemed good enough, they will in reality be barred from academic studies, no matter their abilities in math etc.   
If you fear that may be a problem for your kid, private German lessons might be a problem - I am sure e.g. Berlitz will be able to arrange something; they found a teacher for Swiss German for our then 7 year old. And it is still likely to be cheaper than international school.   
Being a multilingual home (Danish and Portuguese to the kids, English between adults) we are probably less worried than monolinguals.   
Good luck

			Dear Oscar   
Since moving into your appartment we have had over 47 complaints of noise and unneighbourly behaviour from local residents, some of them so disturbing they have made my teeth curl.   
To this end we request you to leave the appartment, town, country and continent without delay.   
Failure to adhere to this demand will result in sending in 23 of our most brutal troops armed with the sharpest Swiss army knives to cut holes in your favourite underpants.    
You may feel that the punishment for your crimes is a trifle severe, your only saving grace is that you did not flush your toilet after 10pm, if this had been the case you would have been executed in your bed.   
Before your flight, which I suggest you undertake in the early hours of the morning, before your neighbours are warned by the security cows please deliver one more bottle of this excellant wine to me (address will be PM'ed to you later with a scan of the label) and a letter of apology to the Swiss nation.   
Forever yours   
PP Bernard     
Ps I am still lerning German if I have made any mistakes then I apollogise in advance. Bravesocks

			Thank you all for your replies; I've been away on holiday so I haven't had a chance to respond until now.   
I found   post particularly enlightening, and gave me hope that it might be possible. I nevertheless understand that even with lecture notes and much of the course being taught in the universal language of mathematics, if my German is not to a high standard I will have a lot of trouble, and the language barrier will be an unnecessary disadvantage to me from the start.   
So if university decisions come round and I'm not confident that I can learn German to that standard, I will go to one of the alternatives. As I mentioned before, my A-Level results may or may not be good enough for Oxbridge, I will certainly apply but I don't think Oxbridge is right for me. I am still yet to go round Edinburgh and Imperial College which are both on the agenda.       
As it stands I imagine I will end up applying to (not in order):   
Kings College Cambridge 
Edinburgh 
Imperial College 
[ ETH Zurich   
MIT (although if I were to get in - which is unlikely - I would have a major financial problem)     
To answer  I've been with an engineering course called Smallpiece Trust to Durham University, Kings College Cambridge, Churchill College Cambridge and Southampton. On the courses you spend a few days at the university going to lectures (sometimes from people in the Physics department). You get a feel for what a place is like, what drives the staff, and the students too. My dad is an academic so a university is always a place of interest whenever we visit a city, so I generally do get an idea of what the different univerisities offer in their courses. The course plan is also a major indicator to me as to what to expect from that university,   
Anyway, everything in this post is subject to change, thankfully no decisions need to be made yet. I thank you all again for the help you've given me, much of which is invaluable.

			Hi everyone, I will have just arrived in CH from Hamburg and will be setting up flat in Geneva in a week odd. I`m a native english speaker and have learned some fairly embarrassing pidgeon-german so far. But I`d love to improve it! If there is anyone located near the city centre of Geneva who would like to work on their English while bearing some of my german in return, I`d love to hear from you! (I really want to prepare for the lowest level of the Deutsche als Fremdschprach exam so someone with a linguistic background would be super). 
Either way, write me if you`re interested! Thanks!

			Excellent advice! I have also just moved to Basel from Malaysia and was contemplating learning either French/ German. Plan to do both, but will start off with German first. Hopefully, it will help with grocery shopping - have serious problem buying vegetables/fruits where you have to refer to the numbers indicated on the signage - sometimes the signs don't clearly point to the items they are referring to!

			Hello,    
I'm actually a French teacher, and have seen your notice. Since I speak English myself, I could - if you haven't yet had a French course - give you a crash course myself, that would last about a week. Otherwise, I also have an intensive French course (with a class of a few people) but that's three hours a day during 1, 2 or three weeks (but cheaper, since more people will take part).    
If you are interested or just want to know more, you can contact me at :        
Best!

I did not get a chance to see if it is used anywhere else in Austria.  Though if the word did in fact originate in Switzerland, then I would expect its use to be common throughout Tyrol for it to have reached as far east as Salzburg.

For folks living in Baselland, they have an intensive program which is both good and cheap.  Another place to look is your local Volkshochshule.     
Myself, I took my lessons from my local community college in the US, at the local Auslanderdienst in Baselland (Pratteln) and I've taken courses at Klubschule Migros.  I was quite happy with the lessons I got from all the places I took them from.  I do believe that it does make a big difference who the teacher is.  Sit in on a class if you can.

			Lucky you for being a native speaker    
Whenever I come up with my own little ways for remembering how the conjugation works and I run them past my native german speaking friends the response is always, ""I never thought of it, but yeah I guess you're right, it does work that way""   
And of course it doesn't work for all instances but anything that can simplify even a little and get someone into the language is useful.      "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2007	Groaned at 32 Times in 32 Posts	German tips ...	Polorise	Posts: 2,739	2,470	19	Language corner

			Hi all,   
I've been living in Switzerland for three years, but because of the working env (English speakers) I have never had the chance to learn German seriously.   
I'm looking for someone willing to teach me and my wife German; in change, we can teach English (she's American) or Italian (me). 
Since I'm a software engineer, I can also teach computer/programming stuff, or mathematics, as needed.   
Ideally we are looking for someone located in Basel or Aargau, because we live in the same area.   
Cheers,

Once when I was at a dinner with a few Swiss friends, I was asked if I knew what the 'Gang go Klub' was by the men there.  I said that yes, I'm a member, and the Swiss men laughed and said they were also members.  You have to be married to be in the 'Gang go Klub'. ;-)   
The Schnitzelbank are pretty tough to figure out even if you're Swiss.  On top of that, they usually have double or triple meanings.  They're some of the best word-play in the German language.  Always read them out loud to your self to try to figure out what's going on, then have your Swiss significant other explain them to you.  Thanks for the link.   The one we thought was great last year was the commentary over Chrstoph Blocher's daughter buying the Basler Lecherli company.  It was something like: ""Well, Zuricher Geschnetletes (a traditional culinary dish, in case you don't know) doesn't have any Zurichers in it, so why should Basler Lercherli have any Baslers"". ;-)

			I would guess that ""degressive"" sounds better than ""regressive."" Well, it sounds better to me... Regressive sounds very retrogressive, whereas degressive sounds pretty civilized (albeit a tax system with which I disagree). I presume that that is the reason for the choice. I personally have always called taxation like that ""regressive"" when compared to ""progressive"" taxation -- but I want the negative connotations.

i don`t think you`ll be bored at B2 or above,I have Higher grade French, studied 2 years at uni and worked in french speaking hospitals for 5 years. presently doing  short preparatory course for B2 which I thought would be a doddle for me.Actually much more difficult than I thought, it entails both written, oral and listening comprehension.

			Have you learnt a language at school?   
I've been here nearly ten months now and have picked up little to no German or Swiss German.   
But I never did German at school as a youngster, I did French. And when in France, albeit only ever on week long holidays I found myself remebering it and picking it up surprisingly quickly. I reckon had I been based in a job in Geneva I'd have been more than capable of passable French by now, even in my advanced years (once you get past 35, you're an old dog somebody's trying to teach new tricks to   )

A really neat idea -- a couple of German film students took to the streets to 'say hello to the people' and see what the people say back.    
Somehow nice to see that someone actually does say all these strange words written in my textbook!    
Now, if only a kindly Swiss would do the same in the streets of Berne ...

			Oh, no way! I don't want to keep her in an English speaking group. I need her to start German...the problem was from where, how fast and intense. She has Czech from me, English from dad (and me when around English speaking people) so now we need  the German part, because I don't want  her to mix it all together if I start speak German to her also. I was even thinking to get German/Swiss speaking babysitter for few hours a week so she has the language at regular basis (besides TV)

			I have been going twice a week to the Migro school in Zug, and once a week to Liz also in Zug. Both are as good as the teacher and other students allow - I don't think which school you choose is the issue.    
The problem (I think) is that becoming profficient in classroom German is less important than having the opportunity to speak every day in German to someone who wants to speak recreational/colloquial German with you as an end in itself......konnen Sie helfen mir kind of stuff isn't much use in  recreational chit-chat scenarios - all in my humble opinion naturlich!

2957	06.05.2007, 22:33	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Taiwan	"    There's a fast learning method called 'Pimsleur', but it really depends on your aim.  If you want to speak the language, Pimsleur appears to be the shortcut to build up at least a base vocabulary for conversation.  However, to understand structure and read/write German takes quite a bit longer.  I never really learned formal German but it's part of my home dialect (I grew up in the south of the Netherlands) so I have a reasonable vocabulary grasp of the structure by sheer exposure.  Also note that German is not   German.   
My theory is that getting to a conversational standard will get you much quicker into a position where you can USE the language and thus assimilate structure (grammar, syntax) and more vocabulary on the fly which must be better than just cramming it from a book and CDs.   
I'm going to use that theory as I have need to lean Spanish.  I'll probably try and start with Pimsleur, so I can at least start listening to TV/radio in that language, then work my way through a Berlitz pack for vocab, reading and writing. From my few years in Belgium I know I have little talent for languages so I need all the help I can get :-).  Oh, BTW, aim for CD based courses as you can copy them into an iPod and listen to them while travelling..

But it just seems like no matter how well you do, you can't place in anything higher than B2.

			I am in a similar situation of trying to learn a little of the language before I move to Switzerland. I have five years of German under my belt, although I have never yet been in the position to use it in everyday situations.   
That being said, I am currently trying to refresh my German whilst simultaneously learning as much Swiss German as possible. Ho boy! It's a different language alright! The Swiss German is messing up my High German and vice versa. Every time I try to speak in one, the other comes out, and since I only have a smattering of Swiss, I finish sentences and phrases in High German.   
My advice based on this experience is to focus on one or the other, rather than learning High German and hoping to pick up SG in Zurich. They're similar enough to get REALLY confusing if learning both.   
Also, if you want to get a jump-start on learning Swiss German, there are some good learning aides that you can get relatively easily. Pimsleur makes a Swiss German audio set. I also bought a copy of Dr Chly Prinz direct from the translator and have been reading it alongside the English translation (The Little Prince). My personal favorite is a book that is made to go along with the Swiss-made movie   (which you can get by googling the movie title). That one is good because the movie itself is a parody of Swiss culture.

			Hi Felix,   
If you are still in London, check out the Goethe-Institut.  In addition to running German classes they often run local social events for expat Germans and very one is welcome.  When I lived in Dublin year ago, I used to attend German breakfasts and there you got a chance to practice your German in real situations.  I expect they do the same in London.   
If you are already over here, then think about joining a local club or association.   This will help, but I expect that you may end up learning more Swiss German than High German!   
Best Regards,   
Jim

			I'm attending beginner German at Migros Klubschule and we have about 8 different nationalities in the class.  The teacher speaks in German but she will say it in English if we don't understand.  One of the first things she did was check if everyone could speak some English, however I have heard her explain things to people in Spanish and even attempt some Arabic.  Perhaps your boyfriend should try again or try a school with smaller classes, my boyfriend is in a class of 3 and his teacher is also quite happy to explain things in English if they are having problems.

			I think in Berliz you are not allowed to take trial lessons, but you may give it a try anyway.   
I think the most important factor is not the school itself, but the teacher. Many of them work in more than one school, so you are not necessarily getting the best teachers just because you're paying the most expensive school (since the same teacher may be also lecturing in another cheaper school).   
Besides, each teacher has a particular style. Some focus on speaking, others in grammar, some follow the course book, others don't and so on. I recommend you to ask specifically about the teacher assigned to your level and check if his/hers philosophy match yours about language learning.

			Hello,   
Many of you may be familiar with the use of flash cards for learning new vocabulary. For those who don't, a flash card is basically a card that has a word written on the front side (or a picture) and the correspondent word in the foreign language on the back side.   
It turns out that there is a lot of programs that make the task of creating and using flash cards easier and funnier. For those of you who use Linux (the large minority I suppose :-) there is an excellent program called KVocTrain, where you can practice your vocabulary, create random queries, multiple choice questions,  practice with verbs and much more.   
I'm sure that there are similar programs for Windows as well, so if anybody knows about one of them please tell your experience.   
Best regards!

I'm still based in Finland. I'm trying to quit my job here and move to Switzerland to join my partner who moved to Zurich a month ago.    
I don't know about Geneva, but when I was in Zurich two weeks ago I was surprised how many Italian native speakers you see around. If your daughter won't be able to study Italian at school, it shouldn't be too difficult to find a native speaker with teaching experience willing to give her private lessons.

			Your best bet would probably be taking the DALF (C1 or C2). It is possible though that they will have you take a language test at the beginning of your studies (that's what they do at Uni Zürich) and then tell you if you need to take further language classes and take the same test again a year later.   
Just e-mail the exchange coordinator in your field and ask them directly - that way you will receive the most accurate information...       
Cheers,

The class was good, well structured, and informative, but I had a fairly large class (luckily it wasn't the full 18 they normally have) and slower members of the class can slow progress down substantially. The real weak spot is that you do not have much time to practice your verbal skills. However, your general skills will improve substantially there. You should check to see if they're already booked out -- they have a very limited number of spots.

In fact this just underscores my earlier point - don't just ask for a native, ask for someone with teaching qualifications. Unfortunately in your mother-in-law's case the person standing in front of the class wasn't a German teacher! All the more reasons to ask about qualifications and experience.

I pointed out that in English we actually dropped the informal form 'thou' for the formal form 'you'. However, many English native-speakers are surprised the 'thou' is not the formal form because of the 'King James' version' or 'Authorised version' of the Bible where God is address as Thou.   
It is as difficult for English-speakers to imagine that there can be two versions of 'you', as it is for German-speakers to imagine there can be only one...

			For me, it is the grammar. And I don't mean the complicated high-level grammar. I mean the basics.   
I don't have a clue what half of the terms are in English, much less when someone tries to explain them to me for German (and in German, no less!). I just blank out and nothing is absorbed.    
I learn best by recognizing patterns, figuring them out and building on them, which is difficult when learning German. When I was a programmer, I'd learn to read the code first, and then use the code. But writing from scratch always had me looking up old code to get the clues to start me off.

The CDs opened up all sorts of knew tenses for me and I liked the way Michel continually pushes you to say some pretty complicated sentences eg If I had known you would be arriving this morning then I would have waited for you.   
Yet it was sinking in quite painlessly! After a few spins of each CD I was uttering sentences of a complexity that would have been beyond my comprehension before starting the course.   
A lot of difficult grammar is covered but because everything is geared towards   the language, I found it quite easy to assimilate. Listening to the students making mistakes on the CD was also useful because it helps steer you away from common pitfalls.   
A very worthwhile CD package. I'd be very interested to hear how someone with no prior knowledge of the language fared with the beginners course.

			One factor that made Swiss German so easy to learn where I worked, was that so much of it was in fact, English. ""Mir bruuched schnall s Business Plan mit Financials und dazu ein One Pager"". Duh.   
It's sometimes difficult for me to speak German and chuck English words in, because I don't know what non-English speakers will understand. I watched the Swiss movie Breakout (great German language name, eh?) and was surprised about the English.    
On the other hand, sometimes I just don't know the word in German so try the English one just in case.    
On the other other hand, there are some words like ""Anyway"" which sound pretty cool when used in an otherwise German speaking situation.   
If mixing languages together helps for a better understanding, then I agree with it.    
>Do the Swiss slip in Schweitzer-Deutsch in  
>international management meetings to their advantage? 
No. Using a language that not everyone at the meeting can speak is rude. It might also suggest that the offender isn't competent enough at speaking the language of the meeting, in which case, why are they a member of that group in the first place?

			A word which always throws me is ""kompetent"".  When a german speaker says ""Ich bin nicht kompetent"" it sounds like a confession of inadequacy or ineptness instead of which they are just passing the buck and protesting that it's not their fault or responsibility !

			Its not an exam, it is a grading test. 40% is probably sufficient to do a B1 course without struggling. A lot depends on your existing language skills ie. people with very good English skills progress quite rapidly in german classes because of the inherent similarities (with the exception of gender).      Don't worry, you are not alone. Written skills are normally the weakest for any foreign language, and German is no exception, especially because of the complex grammar.    
But one way or another, if you want to learn this language you are going to have to practice the written component.   Mark has gone to great length to assemble a wide array of topics and cheat sheats that you will find very helpful when you put pen to paper.

			Pronunciation is very important in many languages. It determines whether you will be taken seriously in German, since it gives a clue to the person listening to you about your ability to speak the language. Good pronunciation will not only make you feel more comfortable with the language, it will help to avoid those situations where people switch to English out of ""politeness"".   
As English-speakers we naturally bring our own pronunciation into German - it's just a matter of habit. Learning the correct pronunciation of certain vowels and a few consonants can go a long way.   
The following table is from my first German notebook. It is listed on the very first page, as it was the very first thing I learned. I wasn't allowed to proceed further until I was able to pronounce each letter correctly.          ( )         I've modified this table from the original slightly as I didn't fully agree with some of the examples. It should also be noted that the examples given are for standard English, if you speak with an accent in English, try to think of how the sound should be in standard English before trying the German examples.     
The ""d"" in German tends to be a little shorter and doesn't linger quite as long as it does in English. Consider ""landed"" - the d sound can be heard quite distictly. ""und"" in German is halfway between a ""d"" and a ""t"", and the sound doesn't linger - it's very crisp and short. 
The ""y"" in German is closer to ü. Consider ""typical"" in English - the ""y"" sounds more like the ""i"" in tip. German   is actually more like toopish, except with a much shorter ""oo"" than the sound in ""goose"". 
The ""th"" in German doesn't exist as it does in English where the letters are combined into a single sound as in ""thistle"". In German if you encounter it in a word like ""Mathias"" (male name) the ""t"" and the ""h"" will be pronounced separately, but in quick succession.       
People have different problems with different parts of German pronunciation, often depending on where they are from. The following observations are generalisations and not true in all cases. If you fall into one of these groups you may want to double-check certain aspects of your pronunciation so that you can get it correct as you progress.   
British people tend to have the biggest problem with the deeper vowel sounds in German. Vowels like ""u"" are quite deep and the British tend to  move their tounge further forward in the mouth to create a vowel  sound with a higher pitch. This often sounds as if they have added an umlaut to the vowel, resulting in u sounding like ü or ö, etc. A classic example is "" "" (the town, and a train). It should sound like tsug (with a low sounding ""u"", quite short), but if often sounds like zoog (as in the oo in goose), with the oo sound often extended to ""ooo"".   
Almost all English-speakers have problems with the rolling ""r"" of German, with perhaps the exception of South Africans who are used to the more guteral sound of Afrikaans. Americans and Irish have the greatest problem as their own ""r"" sound in English is more drawn out and pronounced than with other nationalities. Special care should be taken with German ""r"" - the tip of the tounge actually almost touches the roof of the mouth as air is forced past. Imagine imitating the sound of a cat purring, while simultaneously attempting the ""r"" sound. Practice with the word  . The ""r"" should be crisp and quick with the tip of the tounge moving upward to the roof of the mouth, not flat and drawn out.   
Irish should have an advantage with ""th"" since in Irish English many ""th"" sounds are shortened into ""t"". This should make it easier to cope with the separate pronunciation of ""t"" and ""h"" in German (see above).   
German ""z"" and ""s"" are often problematic for native English speakers. It's important to remember that generally there is a ""shift"" of these letters. In other words ""s"" normally sounds like ""z"" and ""z"" normally sounds like ""ts"". The difference is the position of your tounge - with an English ""s"" the tounge sits further back in the mouth as you breathe out. As you move the tounge further out toward the lips the sound will change from ""s"" to ""z"" and then to ""ts"" before stopping altogether. As you pronounce these sounds in German, hold your tounge slightly further forward to get the shift. Note that the ""ss"" in German which is sometimes written as ß (but never in Switzerland) sounds exactly like English ""s"" - no shifting toward ""z"" is required, in fact it can be treated just as ""ss"" would be in English   
German ""ch"" is often a big source of problems. Taking the word   (I) for example, English speakers often say it as ""Ish"" or ""Ick"". The correct pronunciation is  exactly in the middle and sounds almost like a hiss is being emitted. Some people may like to think of a word they might have heard often which ends in ""....loch"" - this is the same ""ch"" sound used in   etc.   
Finally a note regarding the correct pronunciation of ""g"" in words like  (twenty). The correct pronunciation is a soft ""ch"" sound, but it is more often than not heard as a hard ""g"" - this is known as hyper-correction - an attempt to over-correct other common mispronunciations in other words. It's not really wrong, but you'll never be able to get a straight answer from a German native-speaker or a teacher. The academics are still arguing about it  .   as heard in the area around Frankfurt  is definitely not correct (unless trying to speak in Hessisch dialect).

			Often at federal level some documents will be able in English, but at the canton level you generally only get the language of that canton. For example if you live in the French-speaking part and you get caught by a speed camera in Zurich they will send you all the documentation in German, which people on the other side of the  probably can't read.   
You will find that some places such as the motor registry may produce some documents in other languages. I recall seeing some info sheets in Turkish, English and various other languages last time I was there.

I mean MTV in the states has a show where the entire car gets reworked, and a lot of money is spent. So MTV Europe does the same thing, except on 1% of the budget - with a bike. I just can't bear the watch it.

   Also, make sure it _arrives_ by the specified date.  It's not good enough to have _sent_ it before the deadline.  A friend got hit for almost six months extra rent because his quitting letter was one day late - he posted it on the day before last of month, a Saturday, but it arrived on the Monday which was the first of the next month.  The landlord refused to accept it.
